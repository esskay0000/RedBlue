Multi-hyphenate media mogul Tyler Perry has shattered real estate records with the sale of his 17-acre Atlanta estate.

The seven-bedroom, 14-bathroom home, which originally listed for $25 million, was purchased for $17.5 million, making it the most expensive property transaction in the cityâ€™s history.

The mansion, which we previously featured as a Listing of the Day, is equipped with extravagant entertainment amenities including a music room, a home theater, a 2,000-bottle wine cellar and a 9,500-square-foot ballroom.

The property was reportedly last purchased in 2005 for $9 million.
