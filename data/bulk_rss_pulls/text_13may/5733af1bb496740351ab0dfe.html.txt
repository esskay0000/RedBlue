 The inside track on Washington politics.

The Republican National Committee is striking out in spectacular form on Twitter lately.

First, the GOP thanked Republican presidential candidates and said the party is “better for your efforts.” (Cue the dumpster fire gif.) Now, RNC chairman Reince Priebus is calling Hillary Clinton’s primary defeats by Bernie Sanders “nothing short of embarrassing.”

As #NeverTrump’s Rick Wilson put it, “I can think of something more embarrassing.” And now that Republicans are preparing to make Donald Trump their White House nominee, the Internet is not letting Priebus forget it.

As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, the Priebus tweet had 3,065 likes. But mostly, people seemed to be enjoying the chance to coin their own responses.

Here are some of the best ones:

Thanks for your concern. The Republican Party accidentally nominated Donald Trump. https://t.co/ByeVIKzOV5

Hi, @Reince. I made a little chart for you to put things into perspective. I think you may find it useful. pic.twitter.com/Lc724uI6pG

If this is "embarrassing," imagine what adjective you'd need to describe nominating say, Donald Trump for president! https://t.co/DHkWFAgSuw

Could be worse, Hillary could’ve had white nationalists as delegates at the convention. Now that is embarrassing. https://t.co/RJKxLP9rW5
