 The inside track on Washington politics.

We originally wrote this story in February after a Bloomberg News investigation into Rep. Grayson's financial holdings. We've updated it in light of Grayson's feud Wednesday with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). 

Weirdest. Most controversial. Flashiest. Least likely to care what other people think about him.

You could argue all of those superlatives apply to Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), the Teflon Man of congressional politics who is now throwing a wrench in Democrats' 2016 plans to take back the Senate. Grayson is serving his second, non-consecutive term in Congress and is running for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).

Despite (or maybe thanks to?) Grayson's penchant for controversy, polls suggested  as recently as February it could be a close primary, though in recent polls he's been lagging. The liberal firebrand is challenging the preferred establishment candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.), whose more-moderate record could open the door to the liberal Grayson in the primary.

Congressional leaders like Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) seem sufficiently worried enough about Grayson's prospects that Reid has called on Grayson to resign his congressional seat, saying Grayson has "no moral compass" after allegations published in the New York Times and Tampa Bay Times that the congressman improperly used his position of power to promote his own hedge fund.

On Wednesday, the two got in an outright feud over it, as The Hill's Scott Wong reported:

In Progressive Caucus meet, #FLSEN hopeful @AlanGrayson attacked Harry Reid for calling on him to drop out over ethics scandal, sources say

Reid immediately replied to Grayson: "It is true and I want you to lose"

— Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) May 11, 2016



Progressive Chair @keithellison tried to stop Grayson from going after Reid: "Why are you doing that? This is so stupid," Ellison said.

But to know Grayson is to know that he is like a lightning rod for controversy. He first came to Congress in 2008, and within a year he was making incredulous national headlines for his comments that "If you get sick, America, the Republicans’ health-care plan is this: Die quickly." Or this on Dick Cheney: "I have trouble listening to what he says sometimes because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he’s talking." He once called Republicans "knuckle-dragging Neanderthals."

One of the few times Grayson publicly apologized for what comes out of his mouth was when he called a female adviser to a Federal Reserve chairman "a K street whore."

To Democratic leaders' relief, Grayson lost reelection in 2010. But he was elected to a different seat in 2012 after redistricting, and he's continued providing his party with headaches.

Perhaps the most fascinating things about this man are not what he says but the situations he finds himself in -- situations the media inevitably writes about. Like a car wreck on the side of the highway, it's impossible to look away. Behold the seven most amazing sentences written (so far) about Grayson:

1. Let's start with the reason for re-upping this story: Grayson's brazen challenge to Reid in a group meeting. Lawmakers had actually invited Reid to come talk to them. And then one of their own starts to challenge their guest. Like the lawmakers who were there told Wong, it was an "embarrassing" moment that threatened to undermine Democratic Party unity and just make the Progressive Caucus look bad.  "All the members were appalled," one said.

Then again, Grayson may have figured he didn't have much to lose: Reid and much of the Democratic establishment (President Obama, Vice President Biden) have already committed themselves to the other guy in the Senate race.

2. Let's move on to the original reason we wrote this story in February: A Bloomberg News investigation into Grayson's financial holdings published Friday by Steven Dennis. Dennis found that Grayson, who is an active investor (and among the richest members of Congress) despite that being against congressional protocol, had cashed in holdings in a mining company that gets most of its revenue from Eritrea, an impoverished African dictatorship known for forced labor.

Dennis approached Grayson about the holdings. Grayson denied knowing of the country's "pariah state" status before his stock in the mining company was sold last year. Dennis then wrote this about their convo:

Asked whether in retrospect he regretted his family profiting off a company that invested primarily in a country known for human rights abuses, including forced labor, Grayson declined further comment and ended the interview.

3. In 2015, the Grayson saga took a turn for the personal. He accused his divorce-seeking wife of bigamy. "For those who don't know what that is or forgot what it is because, after all, it's 2015," wrote The Fix's Aaron Blake at the time, "it's marrying someone when you're already married to someone else." The sentence, via the AP:

A trial to determine whether U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson's wife committed bigamy when she wed the congressman has been delayed because she required emergency surgery to remove breast implants.

4. It wouldn't be a story about a haywire lawmaker without some news story about him stepping in it on race. This from Politico in 2013:

Florida Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson’s campaign sent out a fundraising email likening the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan, complete with an image of a burning cross.

5. And it wouldn't be a story about a haywire lawmaker without some kind of reference to the Holocaust. This from the Jewish Telegraph Agency in 2009:

Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) has told the Anti-Defamation League he regrets using the term 'holocaust' to describe the current state of the U.S. health care system.

6. Let's stay in 2009, which was a big year for Grayson. It's when he started to become a national name for his extreme comments. The New York Times' David Herszenhorn called him "the liberals' problem child" and had this to conclude about the then-freshman congressman:

[I]n recent weeks, Mr. Grayson has catapulted himself to national renown for outlandish rhetoric and a pugilistic political style that makes him seem less staid lawmaker than a character on the lam from one of his Orlando district’s theme parks.

7. A great 2009 Tampa Bay Times profile of Grayson by Alex Leary has a few gems as well:

Asked where he got his political leanings, Grayson's answer ran eight minutes.

8. And this one from Leary's profile is two sentences, but it's too good not to include. We'll end our story with this:

The pink cowboy boots he wore in court are now black, but in Washington, Grayson is apt to wear orange-and-pink shirts and ties that can be charitably described as interesting. 'I thought at first he was trying out for a road company of Guys and Dolls,' said Rep. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the Financial Services Committee.

8. To be continued ...
