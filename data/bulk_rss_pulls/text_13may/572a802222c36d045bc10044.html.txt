Donald Trump incorrectly accused Hillary Clinton of being the original source of questions surrounding President Obama’s eligibility to run for president.

In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Trump — who is now the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party — was asked about Clinton’s comments at a NAACP event in Detroit over the weekend that accused him of leading the birther movement.

“The leading Republican contender is the man who led the insidious birther movement to discredit the president’s citizenship,” Clinton said in a clip that CNN’s Wolf Blitzer aired during the interview. “We cannot let Barack Obama’s legacy fall into Donald Trump’s hands.”

“Do you know who started the birther movement?” Trump responded after the clip aired. “Do you know who questioned his birth certificate? One of the first, Hillary Clinton. She’s the one that started it, she brought it up years before it was brought up by me.”

But Clinton didn't start it. According to FactCheck.org, while some of Clinton’s supporters did question Obama’s birth certificate “there is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with it.”
