Political novels aren’t what they used to be, no doubt because truth really is stranger than fiction nowadays. But three of the top-selling American political novels of the 20th century, Allen Drury’s “Advise and Consent,” Edwin O’Connor’s “The Last Hurrah” and Robert Penn Warren’s “All the King’s Men,” continue to be read and remembered to this day, doubtless in part because they were all turned into Hollywood movies. Alas, none of those movies was worthy of its source material, not even Robert Rossen’s 1949 film version of “All the King’s Men,” which won a best-picture Oscar. Mediocrity is, of course, the usual fate of good novels that make it to the big screen, but it’s especially disappointing in the case of “All the King’s Men,” which is more relevant today than ever before.

It goes almost without saying that Rossen was lost before he started. No film can convey more than a sliver of the essence of a great novel, and “All the King’s Men,” which was inspired in part by the career of Huey Long, ranks among the greatest. This is all the more remarkable because it is about politics, a subject notorious for turning the brains of artists into mush. Yet there is nothing sentimental about Warren’s portrayal of Willie Stark, a Long-like Louisiana politician who seeks power to do good and is ultimately destroyed by it. A man I know who used to work for a very famous politician once told me that “All the King’s Men” and Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus” are the only two works of literary art that tell the harsh truth about politics.

An idealistic young reformer turned ruthless operator, Stark’s life is changed utterly when he comes to the reluctant conclusion that all men, however honorable they may seem to be, are both corrupt and corruptible: “Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud.” This leads him to treat any political means, however illegal, as acceptable so long as the end is sufficiently desirable. The law, he explains, is “always too short and too tight for growing humankind. The best you can do is do something and then make up some law to fit and by the time that law gets on the books you would have done something different.”

Is Stark right to be pessimistic about what he calls “the nature of things”? If so, does that justify his own increasingly monstrous behavior? Or can noble ends be corrupted by the evil means through which we seek to bring them into being? The fact that Warren deliberately leaves this question open is part of what gives “All the King’s Men” its permanent relevance, for it is one of those central yet unanswerable questions around which human conduct perpetually revolves.

But the reason why “All the King’s Men” is of immediate interest can be found in the scene in which Stark addresses a crowd of poor white farmers who care nothing for politics or politicians, having decided that Louisiana will always be ruled by the rich. His first words fill them with resentment: “Friends, red-necks, suckers, and fellow hicks.” But then he surprises them: “That’s what you are. And me—I’m one, too. Oh, I’m a red-neck, for the sun has beat down on me. I’m a sucker, for I fell for that sweet-talking fellow in the fine automobile….nobody ever helped a hick but the hick himself. Up there in town they won’t help you. It is up to you and God, and God helps those who help themselves!” By identifying with their feelings of powerlessness and promising to “nail up anybody who stands in your way,” he forges them into a populist alliance that puts him in the governor’s mansion.

Does this perhaps have a familiar ring? If it doesn’t, your TV is broken. Entirely aside from its value as a work of art, “All the King’s Men” is timely because of the brilliant clarity with which it shows how a shrewd politician can connect with those working-class voters who believe that the existing parties don’t care about them and are looking for a strong, fearless leader to watch their backs.

Poets, Shelley wrote, are “the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” I wouldn’t go that far, or anywhere near it. But when you consider how completely the pundit class failed to get the primaries right, I’d be more inclined to seek political wisdom in the pages of a novel written by a poet-professor who looked 70 years into the future and foretold the coming of a populist demagogue who spoke the language of the plain people. Robert Penn Warren may have made up Willie Stark, but right now he’s as real as a ballot box.

Oh the poor benighted electorate, so vulnerable to manipulators like Sanders and Trump. This article can't be serious. Maybe blame the school system for not teaching history or economics or any form of analytical thinking. Penn Warren's work is one of the great American novels, but if you want an explanation for the current political climate, turn to the great Pogo (Walt Kelly) "we have met the enemy and he is us".

Noting the comments below, as I was reading the article, I was thinking more of Bernie Sanders and Clinton's further lurch to the far left.

Good Lord, you are even using your drama critic to bash Trump!

Sadly polls show over 50% of Americans don't believe hard work & doing the right thing will lead to success. Not doing so will almost certainly lead to failure.

A good companion piece for All the King's Men is A.J. Libeling's The Earl of Louisiana.  It tells of Huey's brother Earl who was in campaign mode when  that book was conceived.  It would not be a bad companion piece for The Last Hurrah.

I've been reminded of All the King's Men—and especially the real-life career of Huey Long upon which it was based—ever since the launch of Trump's candidacy.  As with most demagogues, he feeds on the resentments of others.  All those who feel excluded, those whom life has disappointed, those who feel passed by, or neglected, or are fearful of being surpassed by some other group, are prime targets for the simplistic remedies of the demagogue.  And in fact, his simplistic solutions are never examined, never debated, because what sustains his or any demagogue's thrust for power is nothing rational, and rational arguments have no impact upon it.  The appeal is to pure emotion:  resentment, anger, hatred, fear.  The Trump campaign has managed to awaken something which has seldom been a major feature of our politics, and had been excluded from our national political scene for at least two generations:  not the solutions to problems and a better future, but a raw desire to get even.
