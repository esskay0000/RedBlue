Joe Biden understands something about the Democratic Party and its future that his fellow partisans would do well to consider. “I don’t think any Democrat’s ever won saying, ‘We can’t think that big—we ought to really downsize here because it’s not realistic,’” the vice president told The New York Times in April. “C’mon man, this is the Democratic Party! I’m not part of the party that says, ‘Well, we can’t do it.’” Mocking Hillary Clinton’s criticism of Bernie Sanders for proposing bold reforms, Biden dismissed the politics of lowered expectations. “I like the idea of saying, ‘We can do much more,’ because we can,” he declared, leading the Times to observe that, while Biden wasn’t making an endorsement, “He’ll take Mr. Sanders’s aspirational approach over Mrs. Clinton’s caution any day.”

Unwittingly or not, Biden made an even better case than Sanders has for taking his insurgent campaign all the way to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. If the party is going to run in 2016 on a “do much more” agenda—as opposed to triangulating around the center—the Vermont senator’s supporters and like-minded Democrats, including Clinton’s progressive backers, will have to force the issue. Taking the Sanders insurgency to the convention is the paramount vehicle for placing demands that are ideological and, as Biden’s comments suggest, also strategic. That’s one reason why Sanders promised in a statement on April 26 to go to the convention with “as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform”—despite the fact that Clinton’s delegate advantage now all but guarantees that she will win the nomination.				
					
					
What Sanders is proposing is a necessary quest—and a realistic one. Already, he is better positioned than any recent insurgent challenger to engage in rules and platform debates, as well as in dialogues about everything from the vice-presidential nomination to the character of the fall campaign. As veteran political analyst Rhodes Cook noted in a survey prepared for The Atlantic, by mid-April, Sanders had exceeded the overall vote totals and percentages of Howard Dean in 2004, Jesse Jackson in 1988, Gary Hart in 1984, and Ted Kennedy in 1980, among others. (While Barack Obama’s 2008 challenge to Clinton began as something of an insurgency, he eventually ran with the solid support of key party leaders like Kennedy.) By the time the District of Columbia votes on June 14, Sanders will have more pledged delegates than any challenger seeking to influence a national convention and its nominee since the party began to democratize its nominating process following the disastrous, boss-dominated convention of 1968.				
					
					
This new reality has Clinton supporters fretting about the prospect of a chaotic convention that could expose divisions within the party when it should be uniting for what increasing looks like a fall fight against Donald Trump. But a muscular appearance by Sanders and his delegates at the convention doesn’t have to lead to bitterness. Historically, contested conventions—not carefully choreographed coronations—have led parties and their nominees to take more audacious positions and to excite broader electoral coalitions.

“Conventions are where we come together, but you don’t really come together if you avoid differences,” says the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has protested, attended, or spoken at nearly a dozen Democratic national conventions (and who has not endorsed a candidate in the primary race this year). “You start by understanding that it takes two wings to fly. If you have two strong wings—a wing that has won and a wing that has lost—you don’t deny the differences; you recognize them. You debate, find common ground, find ways to start working together for immediate goals—the next election—and for long-term goals that can mean as much to the nation as to the party.”				
					
					
Recent conventions have been so tightly scripted that it’s easy to forget that both parties have long histories of contested gatherings—sometimes with open combat over the party’s standard-bearer (as may erupt at this year’s Republican convention), but often with spirited competition over rules, platforms, and the very nature of the party itself. Contested conventions can open policy debates and clear the way for “significant political and social progress,” argues Fitchburg State University professor Benjamin Railton, who has analyzed the history of conventions. With 18 state wins so far and more than 1,350 delegates, Sanders is uniquely poised to push for such progress. Since Clinton will likely arrive at the convention with a majority of the pledged delegates and a lead in the popular vote, she’ll have every right to argue, as she did in April, that “I am winning. And I’m winning because of what I stand for and what I’ve done.” Front-runners rarely invite input from insurgent challengers, and if Clinton chooses to wall Sanders off, she’ll have the upper hand in Philadelphia. In January, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz appointed a pair of Clinton allies, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin, to head the platform committee. And an ardent Clinton supporter and noted Sanders antagonist, former congressman Barney Frank, will cochair the rules committee.

But Clinton’s decision to adopt what was initially Sanders’s position on a host of issues, from wages to climate change to trade policy, shows that her campaign recognizes that a substantial portion of the party’s base—as well as its potential base—is attracted to Sanders’s more aspirational message. And the pressure to make that recognition a part of the Democratic platform will grow as the committees expand before the convention and Sanders aides urge the DNC to deliver on the promise made by spokesman Luis Miranda: that the party is “committed to an open, inclusive and representative process” for drawing up the platform, and that “both of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee.”

If Sanders advocates gain sufficient representation to provoke debates, what are the likely pressure points? Like Jackson and his supporters, who forced rules reforms and the diversification of the DNC in 1988, the Sanders camp could champion a more open and representative Democratic Party. There could be calls for reducing or eliminating the role of superdelegates, for a better approach to scheduling debates, and for consistent primary rules to avoid dramatic variations in turnout based on whether the primary is open or closed. Even though Sanders ran well in caucuses, his backers could gain credibility by also arguing that caucuses are too incoherently organized and difficult to participate in to be justified. On all of these issues, Sanders supporters would have to establish alliances with Clinton backers who recognize that it is time to “democratize the Democratic Party.”				
					
					
The prospect of aligning with Clinton supporters, especially progressive members of Congress and labor activists who will attend the convention as superdelegates, creates even greater openings for platform fights. Prospective nominees tend to favor weaker platforms; Harry Truman would have preferred milder civil-rights commitments than were made in his party’s 1948 platform, and it took steady pressure from unions, liberals, and Ted Kennedy to get Jimmy Carter to finally embrace spending on jobs programs. It will take similar pressure to get Clinton and her inner circle to accept a Democratic platform that Sanders says must include “a $15-an-hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health-care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.” Clinton stalwarts may want to keep things vague, but look for the Sanders team to demand specifics, such as an explicit endorsement of a national $15 minimum wage instead of the $12 proposal that Clinton initially offered, and an unequivocal rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that President Obama supports and that Clinton once championed but now criticizes.				
					
					
As it happens, many of Clinton’s most passionate allies have been outspoken supporters of the fight for $15, fair-trade policies, and proposals to break up the big banks. One of them, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a potential vice-presidential pick, has argued publicly that Clinton “should work with [Sanders] on the platform” in order to strengthen the party’s appeal. Other Clinton backers like Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro and nonaligned House members like Wisconsin’s Mark Pocan could play a critical role in steering the party toward unequivocal opposition to the TPP. There could also be room for cooperation on addressing mass incarceration, passing constitutional amendments to get big money out of politics, and guaranteeing voting rights for all.

Sanders backers want to win these platforms fights—not to make a point about their campaign, but to make a deeper point about what the Democratic Party must stand for in order to win the 2016 election and the future. “The convention can amplify what this campaign made visible—that there are millions of Americans who are hurting—and say that the Democratic Party has to respond to that pain with bigger and bolder policies,” says Working Families Party national director Dan Cantor, a veteran of the 1988 Jackson campaign who is now a Sanders backer. “Democrats who want to win a big majority in November, to take back the Congress and to move forward in the states, know that the party has to stand for something that excites young people, that excites working people. No matter who the nominee is, the party has to take a big-vision stand.”

Sanders backers want to win these platforms fights—not to make a point about their campaign, but to make a deeper point about what the Democratic Party must stand for in order to win the 2016 election and the future. “The convention can amplify what this campaign made visible—that there are millions of Americans who are hurting—and say that the Democratic Party has to respond to that pain with bigger and bolder policies,” says Working Families Party national director Dan Cantor, a veteran of the 1988 Jackson campaign who is now a Sanders backer. “Democrats who want to win a big majority in November, to take back the Congress and to move forward in the states, know that the party has to stand for something that excites young people, that excites working people. No matter who the nominee is, the party has to take a big-vision stand.”				
					
					
		

A Contested Convention Is Exactly What the Democratic Party Needs

This Is What Happens When Republican Voters Get What They Want

Why Bernie Didn’t Get My Vote

“Conventions are where we come together, but you don’t really come together if you avoid differences,” says the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has protested, attended, or spoken at nearly a dozen Democratic national conventions (and who has not endorsed a candidate in the primary race this year). “You start by understanding that it takes two wings to fly. If you have two strong wings—a wing that has won and a wing that has lost—you don’t deny the differences; you recognize them. You debate, find common ground, find ways to start working together for immediate goals—the next election—and for long-term goals that can mean as much to the nation as to the party.”				
					
					
Recent conventions have been so tightly scripted that it’s easy to forget that both parties have long histories of contested gatherings—sometimes with open combat over the party’s standard-bearer (as may erupt at this year’s Republican convention), but often with spirited competition over rules, platforms, and the very nature of the party itself. Contested conventions can open policy debates and clear the way for “significant political and social progress,” argues Fitchburg State University professor Benjamin Railton, who has analyzed the history of conventions. With 18 state wins so far and more than 1,350 delegates, Sanders is uniquely poised to push for such progress. Since Clinton will likely arrive at the convention with a majority of the pledged delegates and a lead in the popular vote, she’ll have every right to argue, as she did in April, that “I am winning. And I’m winning because of what I stand for and what I’ve done.” Front-runners rarely invite input from insurgent challengers, and if Clinton chooses to wall Sanders off, she’ll have the upper hand in Philadelphia. In January, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz appointed a pair of Clinton allies, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin, to head the platform committee. And an ardent Clinton supporter and noted Sanders antagonist, former congressman Barney Frank, will cochair the rules committee.

But Clinton’s decision to adopt what was initially Sanders’s position on a host of issues, from wages to climate change to trade policy, shows that her campaign recognizes that a substantial portion of the party’s base—as well as its potential base—is attracted to Sanders’s more aspirational message. And the pressure to make that recognition a part of the Democratic platform will grow as the committees expand before the convention and Sanders aides urge the DNC to deliver on the promise made by spokesman Luis Miranda: that the party is “committed to an open, inclusive and representative process” for drawing up the platform, and that “both of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee.”

If Sanders advocates gain sufficient representation to provoke debates, what are the likely pressure points? Like Jackson and his supporters, who forced rules reforms and the diversification of the DNC in 1988, the Sanders camp could champion a more open and representative Democratic Party. There could be calls for reducing or eliminating the role of superdelegates, for a better approach to scheduling debates, and for consistent primary rules to avoid dramatic variations in turnout based on whether the primary is open or closed. Even though Sanders ran well in caucuses, his backers could gain credibility by also arguing that caucuses are too incoherently organized and difficult to participate in to be justified. On all of these issues, Sanders supporters would have to establish alliances with Clinton backers who recognize that it is time to “democratize the Democratic Party.”				
					
					
The prospect of aligning with Clinton supporters, especially progressive members of Congress and labor activists who will attend the convention as superdelegates, creates even greater openings for platform fights. Prospective nominees tend to favor weaker platforms; Harry Truman would have preferred milder civil-rights commitments than were made in his party’s 1948 platform, and it took steady pressure from unions, liberals, and Ted Kennedy to get Jimmy Carter to finally embrace spending on jobs programs. It will take similar pressure to get Clinton and her inner circle to accept a Democratic platform that Sanders says must include “a $15-an-hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health-care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.” Clinton stalwarts may want to keep things vague, but look for the Sanders team to demand specifics, such as an explicit endorsement of a national $15 minimum wage instead of the $12 proposal that Clinton initially offered, and an unequivocal rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that President Obama supports and that Clinton once championed but now criticizes.				
					
					
As it happens, many of Clinton’s most passionate allies have been outspoken supporters of the fight for $15, fair-trade policies, and proposals to break up the big banks. One of them, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a potential vice-presidential pick, has argued publicly that Clinton “should work with [Sanders] on the platform” in order to strengthen the party’s appeal. Other Clinton backers like Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro and nonaligned House members like Wisconsin’s Mark Pocan could play a critical role in steering the party toward unequivocal opposition to the TPP. There could also be room for cooperation on addressing mass incarceration, passing constitutional amendments to get big money out of politics, and guaranteeing voting rights for all.

Hillary Clinton is a terrible campaigner. It is only through big money and insider party process that she is where she is today. Where was she and the DNC all the months the Republicans were spewing their racist message? Sanders brings an issues oriented campaign. A campaign that represents the New Deal Democratic positions that the electorate has been clamoring for. The time of the Democratic Leaderships legacy on the party is over. Enough Hill Billy politics.

It&apos;s also a question of who has the longer coat-tails.  The most crucial issue this year is to repopulate Congress and state legislatures with Democrats and I think Bernie is the one who could do that since he brings large turnouts at elections.  The Republicans have shown that they have no interest in governing to the point of being obstructionist (voting restrictions, etc.), and I can&apos;t see Hillary bringing in more Democrats with her, given her low popularity ratings.

The Democratic Party has become the party of a liberal elite and is out of touch with the issues affecting the working and middle classes. Bernie has fought a valiant battle to make it relevant again, but the DNC and party establishment have never taken him seriously. I think there is still a chance that he could become the Dem nominee if the FBI does its job and recommends that Hillary be indicted soon, but if this does not happen then it is time for Bernie supporters to form a new progressive party or ally with the Green Party in order to save the country from unsustainable levels of income and wealth inequality and the impending ravages of climate change. Without Bernie, the Democratic Party is going down.

Look, the Democratic Party, as Adolph Reed, Jr. observed in a recent diagnosis of the Left, long ago "renounced its commitment to any sort of redistributive vision." It&apos;s thus hard to imagine the Party will embrace in any real way Sanders&apos; platform proposals considering the redistributive logic behind them. Moreover, now that everyday people have taken on as their own the message of hope that the Party has spent the last eight years selling, the Party now  wants to kill hope outright by selling us "realism," "pragmatism" -- i.e., a politics that reduces the possible to the status quo, to the current power arrangements. Sanders supporters have made it clear that that politics isn&apos;t good enough, that something bolder is required. The Party simply isn&apos;t up to the challenge.

These are delusional ideas.  The nomination fight ended.  Bernie doesn&apos;t get a do-over.  He is down by 750 delegates.  He lost fair and square: playing chess and saying it should be easier to win like checkers is really a very weak rationale for not getting out and backing the winning nominee.  That Trump took the republican nomination fight last night should focus the myopic minds that think a contested convention would be a great way to discuss ideas and stick up for a candidate they can&apos;t admit lost.  The last year was that conversation: the ideas of Clinton triumphed over the ideas of Sanders, O&apos;Malley and Webb.  My fellow subscribers and readers of the Nation can&apos;t fathom that folks like me -life-long fierce progressives- could possibly disagree with their conclusions about Hillary and Bernie and the  future of the country and the fairness of the democratic party&apos;s nomination process but we do, in large number.  The incredible arrogance of Sanders supporters calling the young voters or independents more important than the other voters in the process, or writing off the importance of southern black voters is absolutely stunning.  The bizarre contempt and lying of the far left about Hillary is equally stunning.  The idea that Bernie should not concede and back and campaign for the first woman candidate to clear the considerable hurdles of history is a pathetic and sad commentary as to the sexism and misogyny still rampant on the left.
We have our nominee.  Get behind her.  stop embracing crazy lies and non-truths about her.  Or embrace Trump.  A very simple choice for rational people.

What exactly are the "crazy lies" that I&apos;m embracing, Michael?

BTW, insinuating that those who disagree with you are delusional, bizarre, pathetic, and misogynistic is not exactly an effective way of  winning minds over to your cause.

You write, "﻿the ideas of Clinton triumphed over the ideas of Sanders." I&apos;m curious. Excluding the Sanders long held positions she "adopted" for campaign purposes, which of the following of Hillary&apos;s "ideas" do you find so compelling?
1) Her consistent votes on behalf of the MIC.
2) Her characterization of the TPP being the "gold standard" of trade agreements.
3) Her refusal to acknowledge the role large banks had in the economic crash of 2008.
4) Her opposition to the reinstatement of Glass-Stegall.
5) Her support for the Keystone XL pipline.
6) Her support for fracking around the world while Secretary of State.
7) Her refusal to allow the people to see what she said to the bankster class behind closed doors even though, according to her own contract, she holds exclusive rights to those transcripts.
8) Her opposition to a $15/hour minimum wage.
9) Her opposition to providing healthcare for all Americans via a Medicare for all system.
10) Her opposition to tuition-free college.
Nice try, but being opposed to those ten positions (and there are many, many more I could list) does not make one a sexist.

Some interesting cognitive dissonance here. This is a "how it should be" scenario, and a proposal for collusion with our oppressor.  Sweet dreams, John.  I really hate to abandon "The Party" but it already abandoned "We, the People..." years ago.

People keep underestimating Bernie.  He may sound idealistic and he is, but he&apos;s also one of the most pragmatic people to come down the pike in a long time, a great strategist.  So why shouldn&apos;t he win the nomination?

Just the thought of Hillary Clinton, by itself, is  depressing I would think for millions of us.  Not only is she completely derivative in her thinking, parroting Sanders like a mechanical being, but the visual is very negative, that of a person glaring at you like someone out of Nazi Germany.  You are supposed to have no choice and just accept it.   Her entire persona has slowly, finally revealed itself.   A fairly mean ass person.

"Like someone out of Nazi Germany"?
This profoundly cruel and delusional rhetoric and should be out-of-bounds on the left or on the right.
Have you no sense of decency?  
We can&apos;t reach for deeply offensive rhetoric just because your favored candidate lost.

Clinton&apos;s campaign headquarters called. They want you back at the office.

Who could disagree with John&apos;s thinking about holding an ACTUAL convention, indeed as opposed to a "coronation." Which is all that these things have become, with thousands of spoken words wasted on dreams for the future. The future is usually discussed far more than the present, the circumstances of which are apparently just not any fun to talk about. We&apos;ve become a people who deny depression exists, or if it does it should be kept in the closet. We&apos;ve become a people who don&apos;t like talking of reality. That&apos;s what this whole "magical thinking" thing is all about--denial. When we see a homeless person we look away, but not without feeling embarrassed and ashamed, as we should feel. But we look away and pretend--more denial.

I would only add to what John suggests, even recommends, that it seems to  me that the candidate whose values and ideas are those that should be put forth and adopted as planks should also be the nominee, shouldn&apos;t he? And yes, let&apos;s be done with super-duper delegates, puhlease!

What reason or reasons do we have to believe a word that comes  out of Clinton&apos;s mouth? Lately, the words that have come out of her mouth have sounded more like those coming out of Sanders&apos; mouth. She&apos;s parroting Bernie trying to win over his voters. You don&apos;t notice Bernie parroting Clinton, do you?

All of the policies John proposes are those thought of and espoused by Sanders, and so why would Clinton be the nominee?

Last, I thought Barney Frank was smarter than that. I&apos;m quite surprised, but he must feel he owes Hillary in some fashion.

Oh and I too quite agree with Charlotte. What HAS Clinton done and what in the hell DOES she stand for?

I wonder how many Bernie Sanders&apos; supporters will support Mr. Nichols&apos; proposed scenario, as opposed to, say, seeing Sanders get the nod via the superdelegates that he is, in every way, a far superior nominee and GOP opponent (as every poll indicates)? The new energy & enthusiasm of the voting public for Sanders is not politics as usual. And it will not go gently into that good convention night if the outcome is Clinton shaking hands on some flaccid agreement cut and pasted from Bernie&apos;s ideas. There are millions of voters who still want the superdelegates to wake up and smell the electoral coffee. Clinton, hobbling at one of the lowest favorability ratings in modern political history (minus 14 at the last recording), is also shown to be the much weaker opponent against Trump. Her primary wins in NY and Arizona are in states currently embroiled in legal challenges for widespread voter disenfranchisement. So the description here of Clinton being pushed to accept some Bernie ideas for the platform appears to be the DNC&apos;s version of making the best of a contentious situation. It is not, however, what the newly engaged, politically aware and active electorate wants. The streets of Philadelphia will be teeming in July with many of those newly-awakened voters and they are not making that trip to watch a Democratic party shove Clinton down their throats even if she is forced to accept a Sanders-lite platform. The divide is huge between the two candidates, but the fissure is even deeper and wider among voters. Whether that matters to the DNC, with its&apos; nauseous pandering to corporate interests, is to be seen. But methinks I smell a third party bubbling up in a way this country has not seen in years, particularly as the electorate becomes more self-identified as independents. Even by July, it may be too late for the Democratic Party to convince those millions of voters that it actually does give a damn about democracy...

EW in 2020. She will pick up the baton left by Bernie -- no matter what happens in November. Bernie&apos;s legacy is far larger than the MSN/DNC minimalization which has plagued his call to progressive arms issued a year ago.

I agree with Charlotte that this is a pretty optimistic take on how things will go.

“I am winning. And I’m winning because of what I stand for and what I’ve done.”  What has Clinton stood for and what has she done? That&apos;s what so many of us want to know. So far in this primary, she has been standing mostly for what Bernie stands for, from the moment she realized how popular his policy proposals were/are. Before Bernie began campaigning, Clinton had no coherent message, so she went on a "listening tour." Then, gradually, Bernie&apos;s message became hers to the point where recently she said "love trumps hate" at one of her town halls; she&apos;s also been railing against "powerful special interests," but those are her primary benefactors. Really Mr. Nichols, you seem so optimistic about this contested convention idea, but how can anyone trust Clinton to follow through with progressive policies, when as soon as the general election begins, she&apos;ll flip-flop back to her centrist self, or perhaps even to her pre-centrist, conservative Walmart/Goldwater girl self? It&apos;s been very demoralizing to watch this unfold; to comprehend that we live in a propagandized plutocracy. Bernie might even pull off a win in Indiana tonight, but the MSM will just say it doesn&apos;t matter, like they&apos;ve been saying about all of his victories, giant rallies, huge fundraising hauls from individual donors, and unprecedented support among young voters.

Best comment on the page, amongst some very good comments, indeed. What I&apos;d like to add to all the comments above is that we need to get rid of not only the superdelegates, but the archaic Electoral College has to go! (Parent/teacher to child: "Yes, Emperor Bush II got fewer votes from We the People in 2000 A.D. than Bore, I mean Gore, but he won because...because...um...do your homework."); and Electronic Voting machines have no place in a democracy, either!!!
