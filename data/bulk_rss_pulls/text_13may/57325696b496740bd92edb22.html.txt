5/10 UPDATE: State prosecutors have announced that they will not pursue a criminal case against McKinney, but instead have referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Federal prosecutors typically handle cases involving crimes alleged to have been committed aboard aircraft.

MAY 9--An Oregon woman flying home last night from Las Vegas allegedly molested another female passenger, according to police who arrested the suspect on a sex abuse charge.

Cops allege that Heidi McKinney, 26, was en route to Portland when she touched the breasts and genitals of a woman who told investigators that the alleged contact was not consensual.

McKinney and the victim were traveling on an Alaska Airlines flight that arrived late Sunday in Portland. Alerted by airline personnel, police met the aircraft upon landing and took McKinney into custody after interviewing the other passenger.

Pictured in the above mug shot, McKinney was charged with third-degree sexual abuse and booked into the Multnomah County jail, where her bail was set at $2500.

It is unclear whether alcohol was a factor in the alleged illegal contact. McKinney’s rap sheet shows that she has previously been charged with drunk driving, reckless driving, and being a minor in possession of alcohol.

According to her Facebook page, McKinney lives in Sherwood, a Portland suburb, and attended Portland Community College. Based on recent posts, McKinney is a “Game of Thrones” fan and supported Dr. Ben Carson’s Republican presidential candidacy. She is pictured below in Facebook photos taken during a prior trip to Hawaii. (1 page)
