For the second Tuesday in a row, Bernie Sanders has won a Democratic primary in a state that Hillary Clinton won in the party’s 2008 nomination race. Last week he took Indiana from Clinton. This week he has taken West Virginia.

						});
					
The Sanders win in West Virginia was a big one. The senator secured 51 percent of the vote to 36 percent for the former secretary of state. He carried every county in the state—taking several with over 60 percent of the vote.				
					
					
Sanders has now won 20 Democratic contests and 1,430 delegates.				
					
					
The senator is still trailing Clinton, who has prevailed in 26 contests and secured more than 1,716 delegates. Even as she was losing West Virginia, Clinton picked up 11 pledged delegates. And with unelected superdelegates counted in, Clinton is over the 2,200 mark in a race where 2,384 delegate votes are needed to win the nomination.				
			

							Sanders says Democrats must build a broad anti-Trump coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality.
						
 
Yet, with another primary state counted in his column, Sanders continues to upend the argument that Democratic race is done. He is still in the running. He will continue to compete for states and delegates—having declared in Oregon on Tuesday night that “we will keep fighting for every last vote.” He will continue to look for opportunities to shape the Democratic message for a fall race against the most divisive Republican nominee in modern political history.				
					
					
“Our message to the Democratic delegates who will be assembling in Philadelphia is, while we may have many disagreements with Secretary Clinton, there is one area we agree: We must defeat Donald Trump,” Sanders told thousands of cheering supporters in Oregon on Tuesday night.				
					
					
That Trump will be the Republican nominee in 2016 was reaffirmed by the voters of West Virginia and Nebraska on Tuesday. (Nebraska Democrats caucused on March 5 and gave Sanders a 57-43 win. However, in Nebraska’s non-binding primary vote Tuesday, Clinton was ahead.)

For Trump, Tuesday’s primaries were essentially a victory lap. Since his Republican rivals have suspended their campaigns, the only question was whether West Virginia and Nebraska voters would register significant #NeverTrump protest votes. They didn’t. With the majority of votes counted, Trump was winning 61 percent of the vote in Nebraska and 76 percent of the vote in West Virginia. (Even among Democratic primary voters in West Virginia, roughly one-third indicated that they could back Trump in November.)				
					
					
Tuesday’s primary wins will give Trump a boost as he goes into Thursday’s high-stakes meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan.				
					
					
No matter how that meeting goes, however, the Democrats know they will be running against Trump.				
			

							Clinton is toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. 
						
 
The question is how they will run.				
					
					
About last week’s reports that Clinton was soliciting support from Republican donors who were unsettled by Trump, Sanders said on Friday, “Those are the kinds of things that make not only my supporters, but millions of Americans, nervous.”				
					
					
Sanders argues that Democrats must recognize that, in many states, the dynamics of a fall race against Trump will not follow classic Democrat-versus-Republican or left-versus-right calculations. There’s an up-versus-down dynamic, as well, and the senator says Democrats must build a broad coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality. Noting reports that Clinton “is now reaching out to Jeb Bush’s fundraisers in order to raise money from them,” Sanders says “that really casts a doubt on the parts of millions of Americans.”				
					
					
“Are you really going to stand up for the middle and working class when you’re collecting millions from Jeb Bush supporters?” asks the insurgent contender.				
					
					
The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. “We are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,” says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for “a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions…”

That’s a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that “Six in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nation’s economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this year—far above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.” Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, “We’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don’t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.” That’s not far from the stance taken by Sanders—who says Democrats should support “a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.” But the senator’s win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and she’s toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. “I have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreement—and that means before and after the election,” she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
“I’m not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,” Clinton added. “I think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.”				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential “gold standard” agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, “In my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.”				
					
					
Sanders has long argued that the United States must “fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.” Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argument—as part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for “the American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.”

That Trump will be the Republican nominee in 2016 was reaffirmed by the voters of West Virginia and Nebraska on Tuesday. (Nebraska Democrats caucused on March 5 and gave Sanders a 57-43 win. However, in Nebraska’s non-binding primary vote Tuesday, Clinton was ahead.)

For Trump, Tuesday’s primaries were essentially a victory lap. Since his Republican rivals have suspended their campaigns, the only question was whether West Virginia and Nebraska voters would register significant #NeverTrump protest votes. They didn’t. With the majority of votes counted, Trump was winning 61 percent of the vote in Nebraska and 76 percent of the vote in West Virginia. (Even among Democratic primary voters in West Virginia, roughly one-third indicated that they could back Trump in November.)

The question is how they will run.				
					
					
About last week’s reports that Clinton was soliciting support from Republican donors who were unsettled by Trump, Sanders said on Friday, “Those are the kinds of things that make not only my supporters, but millions of Americans, nervous.”				
					
					
Sanders argues that Democrats must recognize that, in many states, the dynamics of a fall race against Trump will not follow classic Democrat-versus-Republican or left-versus-right calculations. There’s an up-versus-down dynamic, as well, and the senator says Democrats must build a broad coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality. Noting reports that Clinton “is now reaching out to Jeb Bush’s fundraisers in order to raise money from them,” Sanders says “that really casts a doubt on the parts of millions of Americans.”				
					
					
“Are you really going to stand up for the middle and working class when you’re collecting millions from Jeb Bush supporters?” asks the insurgent contender.				
					
					
The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. “We are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,” says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for “a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions…”

That’s a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that “Six in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nation’s economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this year—far above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.” Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, “We’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don’t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.” That’s not far from the stance taken by Sanders—who says Democrats should support “a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.” But the senator’s win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and she’s toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. “I have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreement—and that means before and after the election,” she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
“I’m not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,” Clinton added. “I think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.”				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential “gold standard” agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, “In my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.”				
					
					
Sanders has long argued that the United States must “fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.” Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argument—as part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for “the American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.”

There’s an up-versus-down dynamic, as well, and the senator says Democrats must build a broad coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality. Noting reports that Clinton “is now reaching out to Jeb Bush’s fundraisers in order to raise money from them,” Sanders says “that really casts a doubt on the parts of millions of Americans.”				
					
					
“Are you really going to stand up for the middle and working class when you’re collecting millions from Jeb Bush supporters?” asks the insurgent contender.				
					
					
The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. “We are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,” says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for “a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions…”

That’s a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that “Six in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nation’s economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this year—far above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.” Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, “We’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don’t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.” That’s not far from the stance taken by Sanders—who says Democrats should support “a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.” But the senator’s win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and she’s toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. “I have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreement—and that means before and after the election,” she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
“I’m not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,” Clinton added. “I think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.”				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential “gold standard” agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, “In my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.”				
					
					
Sanders has long argued that the United States must “fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.” Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argument—as part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for “the American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.”

Clinton took heat for saying in March that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, “We’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don’t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.” That’s not far from the stance taken by Sanders—who says Democrats should support “a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.” But the senator’s win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and she’s toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. “I have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreement—and that means before and after the election,” she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
“I’m not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,” Clinton added. “I think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.”				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential “gold standard” agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, “In my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.”

It is easily feasible, that the Western States and New Jersey, etc. could get Sanders to a virtual tie (or beyond) with "The Clintons."  She is embarrassing herself and the Democratic Party, by reaching out to "moderate" Republicans for support against Trump, and assuming Sanders supporters for granted, too proud to explicitly, humbly, ask for help.  She is assuming coronation, which is likely to anger New Jersey and California Democratic and Independent voters (I&apos;m from Oregon, which will probably landslide for Sanders.)  Then there&apos;s N. & S. Dakota, Kentucky, and Montana.  All the kinds of States, the voters of which Sanders could easily landslide against "The Clintons" as a protest to her pandering to anti-Trump Republicans and their money. 

What also will be wearing her down in the voting public&apos;s eye is: (1) the "food fights" with Trump; (2) Clinton&apos;s "fait accompli" about she, herself, having already won the nomination; (3) Clinton&apos;s suggestions that Sanders supporters should surrender, and support "The Clintons," their super delegate machine, and the DLC "members only" party-within-the-party.

These developments and others could easily turn the political winds against her in the 11th hour.

Bernie Sanders will emerge as the only adult in the room.

Regardless of the winner, it seems important to recognize Bernie&apos;s message has allowed him to attract non-Democratic voters.  It seems to go against a trend, noted since the early Reagan years, for white workers to vote against their own interests, supporting pro-business, anti-worker Republicans.  Globalization has displaced many of our country&apos;s manufacturing workers, who grew up in communities where unskilled laborers had, for a generation or two, nevertheless been able to make a decent living.  It isn&apos;t too hard to see how talk of white privilege would ring hollow for these people.  I can&apos;t ignore data which shows clearly women and people of color are disadvantaged.  However such facts don&apos;t alter the reality of struggling, often white, workers.

I was glad Sanders entered the race. He pushed Clinton further to the left. But for the last few weeks he&apos;s shown his desperation. 
He always promised to talk about issues but, lately, he&apos;s been just short of trying to demonize Hillary. He speaks non-stop about her vote for the Iraq war--something that many Democrats did for political reasons. In her case, because she is a woman, she had to make the case that she&apos;s tough enough. Many Democrats besides Clinton have back-tracked because hindsight is perfect.
A woman called Thom Hartmann&apos;s radio show who claimed she is a Democrat voting for Trump because Hillary is a liar, a cheat and a murderer, among other things. She will not vote for Hillary because she murdered Vince Foster (It was proven that he committed suicide).
Sanders supporters show some poll numbers which show Sanders better able to beat Trump, but Sanders hasn&apos;t been demonized for 25 years like Hillary was. In fact, outside of Vermont, he was rarely heard from. He was a back-bencher who refused to compromise with Democrats whose party he switched to in order to run.
His motto was always that the good was the enemy of the perfect. If something was not perfect, he would vote no--unwilling to compromise. That&apos;s not how a two-party system can govern.
I&apos;m for Hillary because she&apos;s more likely to get things done. Bernie will be like the GOP who say NO to everything--compromise is not in his vocabulary. Trump and the rest of the GOP will tear him to shreds. They will equate socialism with communism.
He depends on a political revolution coming from the young: the young, who never vote. He can depend on them like in 2010 and 2014 when they failed to show up at the polls, thus insuring a Republican congress.
So you "Bernie or Nothing" diehards should stop backing a losing cause and stop demonizing Clinton, which may cause many Democrats and Independents to not vote. Then the election will go to Trump, who could possibly install 3 supreme court nominees. The court will then legitimize voter suppression, anti-abortion laws, gerrymandering and all the other horrific policies of the GOP.

"﻿ So you "Bernie or Nothing" diehards should stop backing a losing cause and stop demonizing Clinton, which may cause many Democrats and Independents to not vote."

A bit patronizing and without citation to authority. More likely and scary is the observation Nichols also makes that, "(e)ven among Democratic primary voters in West Virginia, roughly one-third indicated that they could back Trump in November."
So, we Bernie supporters should do... what, again?

Yes, it is a bit patronizing, but I don&apos;t apologize for the same reason that those who demonize Clinton do not apologize.
Citation? It&apos;s been talked about on TV and written in newspapers for a long time now. You seem like an intelligent person, so I&apos;m sure you know that without my having to cite chapter and verse.

"Best v. Good"... I researched this issue. I could not find Sanders&apos; ever saying that "the good was the enemy of the perfect" as a motto. The history of the quote you cite is obscure; Voltaire said, “The best is the enemy of the good”, the other way around.  The meaning appears to be that striving for perfection is oftentimes a false god, when the lesser goal is the one more in consonance with human experience.  Especially in politics, where compromise, denigrated as a dirty word, is often the only way any progress towards "perfect" can obtain.

So Senator Sanders, aware of human shortcomings which we all share, has always said that the campaign is not about him. It is about attaining a goal that has, hitherto, not been reached: economic and political equality. It is on that anvil that this presidential campaign&apos;s sword must be beaten to become a plowshare for as many people as possible. Even Trump knows that. It&apos;s the rest of us (myself included) that have to re-calibrate our expectations and work to educate ourselves, then exercise the franchise right as best we can, individually, to obtain the "best result possible (good), not the best possible result  (perfect)".

aures lupi

Pardon me for not being clear. I was talking about his actions and speeches, which reflect that attitude. I didn&apos;t think I had to be so literal to an intelligent person like you.

She supported the coup in Honduras. If she needs to keep "proving" that she&apos;s as hawkish as a man, an iron lady, then why vote for her? I&apos;d have to vote for someone who&apos;s not in the position to prove her or himself. It&apos;s counterintuitive, but minorities sometimes feel they have to be "more popish than the pope himself" to maintain their "credentials." Not a good dynamic.

She was probably behind the Ukrainian coup, which installed a Billionaire businessman as President.  She was behind arming Saudi Arabia with a special $12 Billion in Plane and Bombs, etc. that killed thousands of innocent Yemeni mothers, fathers, and their children.  She bungled staging a violent "democratic revolution" instead, proliferating  arms in N. Africa, which have been acquired by anti-Western Jihadis, ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc.  She has shown no compassion for the suffering of indigenous people of Palestine, massacred by the right wing Zionists now controlling Israel, calling it "defending themselves."  In fact, both Trump and Sanders have shown more compassion to those forgotten in the West Bank and Gaza, than this "macho woman" has.

So your only choice is to vote for Trump. Good luck.

Do you live in a bubble, Eddie?  Do you not see that Clinton and Trump are bickering like Trump did with Cruz or Rubio, over proverbial "hand size" issues.  There is a good chance, that, before the primary/convention is over, the Democratic Party, warts and all, will give the nomination to Sanders, with or without those hideous super [patronizing] delegates support, because the polls will show  Clinton losing in the general election, to a "new, improved" Trump.  If they cannot foresee this happening, and react accordingly, the political dynamics will have it that Trump will win.

Yes, I live in a bubble--a different one than the one you live in.

Again, vote for Trump.

I want to know more about the unreported 13% of the vote.  Were other candidate(s) on the printed ballots?  Were they all write-ins?  What is their relationship to the West Virginia DNC?  I hope you can let us know.

To all who will vote for Hillary as the lesser of two evils, please read: "Listen, Liberal" by Thomas Frank.  She may indeed be the lesser evil, but I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT IS THAT THEY ARE VOTING FOR!!!!!!!!!

I want someone from the Nation to follow up on Bill Clinton&apos;s behind closed doors smoozing every New York State legislator to make sure they vote for the TPP. Hillary is temporally saying she is kinda against it, but I don&apos;t know how anyone can believe what what she says. She is liar. Having Bill Clinton back in the white house is very scary. You can get more details about this from those working in the groups fighting the TPP, and they can confirm that Bill Clinton is doing the work on his wife&apos;s behalf. He will make sure the TPP is passed.

Why does no one, no media explain the math disparity... that 51 and 36 do not a 100% make!!  I thought at least your publication might mention it--A West Virginia attorney and Democrat running in protest, Paul T Farrell Jr, received almost 9% and other candidates the rest of the missing 13%.  Thanks for such a bad job of reporting

NY Times&apos; delegate count has 16 for Sanders, 11 for Clinton.  That makes 27.  Where did the other 2 delegates go?  There are 29 delegates in W. Virginia.

Thank you, John Nichols! While so many "journalists" have fallen far from the standard of their profession during this election season, you have always managed to keep your integrity through telling the truth!

Love you John, as long as you keep saying "If" Clinton wins, and she "nearly" has the delegates to win, and as long as you imply Sanders can still win.

 The media "game over" blitz [in favor of Clinton] is making many people nauseous.  This is obviously done to promote apathy among Sanders hopefuls.

It may indeed backfire (with revenge instead of apathy) as those last of the primary voters will feel as if they are being perceived as insignificant by The Clinton Machine and will rebel by voting for Sander.
