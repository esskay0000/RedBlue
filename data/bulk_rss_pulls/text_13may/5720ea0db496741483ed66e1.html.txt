The 2016 presidential campaign moved through Florida and the Midwest.

Voters in 12 states went to the polls as the presidential candidates looked to pick up delegates.

Voters participated in the Republican caucuses in Nevada and in the Democratic primary in South Carolina.

After defeating Bernie Sanders in Nevada, Hillary Clinton is now in a stronger position heading into South Carolina.

Donald J. Trump’s victory put him in a strong position heading toward Super Tuesday, March 1.

Republican and Democratic presidential candidates made stops in South Carolina and Nevada in preparation for Saturday’s voting and caucusing.

With Iowa and its caucuses behind them, the presidential candidates took their campaigns to New Hampshire.

The Republicans had an early victor in Iowa, while the Democrats tensely awaited results.

Before the voting began in Iowa, candidates and volunteers made their last-minute pitches.

With the caucus on the horizon, the presidential candidates blanketed the state with events.
