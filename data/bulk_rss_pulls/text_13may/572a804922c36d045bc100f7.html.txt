Washington (CNN)Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday attacked Donald Trump's rise to become the presumptive Republican nominee, tweeting that the real estate mogul "built his campaign on racism, sexism and xenophobia."

Here's what else is real: @realDonaldTrump has built his campaign on racism, sexism, and xenophobia.

.@realDonaldTrump incites supporters to violence, praises Putin, and is "cool with being called an authoritarian."

There's more enthusiasm for @realDonaldTrump among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.

I'm going to fight my heart out to make sure @realDonaldTrump's toxic stew of hatred & insecurity never reaches the White House.
