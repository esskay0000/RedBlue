 The inside track on Washington politics.

Despite Republicans’ success taking over governors’ mansions these past few years, there’s one state in particular that has eluded the GOP: West Virginia.

The state hasn’t elected a Republican governor in 16 years, even though the rest of its political offices have been steadily — and sometimes abruptly — trending red. West Virginia has voted for the GOP presidential candidate in the past four election cycles, and all but one of its five-member congressional delegation is a Republican. In 2014, Democrats lost control of the state legislature for the first time in 80 years.

After this year, Republicans hope they’ll run the state, too. Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin is term-limited, which means the governor’s seat is up for grabs. Republicans think that if they can win this seat, they can keep it for the next several decades.

Like Kentucky, some political analysts predict West Virginia's red transition — at all levels — could be an inevitable, if delayed, transition from the decades-old North-South political reality in which Republicans rule down South and Democrats up North. We ranked West Virginia most likely state to flip parties in our recent rankings of top five governors’ races of 2016.

But Democrats aren’t going to give up West Virginia without a fight.

They’ve put up their answer to all-politics-is-local in Jim Justice, a 65-year-old, 6-foot-7, coal-lovin’ billionaire whose pitch to voters sounds an awful lot like that of another free-wheelin’ billionaire, Donald Trump.

Justice will face Bill Cole, the state Senate president and an auto dealer, in November. Both sides are setting up for a titanic race.

Here’s what you should know about the man trying to keep West Virginia’s governorship in Democratic hands.

He’s the richest man in West Virginia

Justice is thought to be the state’s only billionaire, according to the Wall Street Journal. His net worth is “somewhat more than a billion dollars,” he told The Washington Post’s Neely Tucker in 2011. “And that would be a very conservative number.”

Justice inherited his father’s coal and corn-farming business and has made even more money investing in coal, timber and corn industries. He’s perhaps best-known for buying and rehabbing one of West Virginia’s oldest, most famous and elite resorts, the Greenbrier, which glittered with presidents and celebrities as far back as the Civil War but fell into bankruptcy in 2009. (Side note: Apparently Trump passed on an offer to buy the Greenbrier, and the little-known Justice stunned West Virginia when he took it on.)

Far from hiding his wealth, Justice campaigns on it

He spent $2 million alone on his primary, though he’s expected to raise funds for the general election, as well as spend his own cash. He says he’ll take a $1 salary as governor. And he pitches his candidacy as a way to give back to the state that has helped make him so successful. “I absolutely don’t need the ego or the status,” he said after winning his three-way primary Tuesday night. “All I need, really, is one thing, and that is for the world to see genuinely how good we really are.”

He also talks up the fact he has never held or run for political office before. West Virginia “needs somebody who knows how to create jobs," Justice says in his campaign stump speech.

Supporters say he’s humble

Growing up, Justice has said, he didn’t realize his family was rich until college. Today, he lives in a modest house in Lewisburg and has coached high school basketball for decades. He takes his team to Applebee’s after a win. He sent his kids to public school. He quietly paid for several local kids’ colleges, according to Tucker.

He’s as big as his reputation

Like, literally. It’s estimated he weighs 300 to 350 pounds. And numerous people have put him at 6-foot-7. He can also be a colorful dresser; at his election party Tuesday, he wore a suit with Crocs.

Justice also apparently gets confused for the famous NFL coach Bill Parcells. (He told USA Today that, when that happens, he just plays the part and signs the autograph.)

He’s a former Republican

And a former independent. In fact, he has switched parties so much that Justice sounded downright disenchanted about politics when chatting with Tucker in 2011. “Like everybody else, I get horribly frustrated when I see what our leaders do, but I’m just not going to get involved in trying to create things before elections.”

This election cycle, Justice has talked about the importance of West Virginia being a faith-based community. He was the only Democratic candidate for governor who questioned humans’ impact on climate change.

And that’s precisely what makes Justice so appealing to Democrats. A traditional Democrat doesn’t have much of a chance these days in West Virginia. Justice fits the mold of a new West Virginia Democrat. He’s small business-friendly; he’s coal-friendly. He’s someone who could be considered a Republican in many blue states.

Republicans say he’s an opposition researcher’s dream

As with any successful businessman, there’s a paper trail to be examined. And Republicans say they have lots to work with. They say they have files and files of Justice’s various companies being late on taxes, being charged fines, failing safety inspections. Expect Republicans to hit his business record hard this campaign.

In 2014, NPR said Justice owed $2 million in overdue fines for some 500 penalties. Tucker looked at past news reports about Justice’s various businesses and found this:

Ken Ward Jr., a Charleston Gazette reporter, wrote in July 2009 that Justice’s company had a “record of trying to avoid workers’ comp payments, ignoring mine safety and health rules, violating environmental laws, and then trying to dodge the monetary fines for those violations.”

He has made some odd friends

This fall, Justice accepted the endorsement of the United Mine Workers Union. It was an unusual arrangement — the union offering its support to the owner of a coal conglomerate.  But the union head had this to say: “He has never run away from a worker’s right to belong to a union. That’s hard to find anymore.” Justice told the miners he would veto a right-to-work bill.

Democrats are hoping Justice’s grab-bag mix of persona and politics can win him many, many more friends as they try to keep West Virginia in their hands.
