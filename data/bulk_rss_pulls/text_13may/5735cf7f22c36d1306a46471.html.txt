A viral video posted on YouTube shows the unbelievable length of a TSA security line at Chicago’s Midway International Airport.



Entitled “TSA are you f***ing kidding me?,” the man filming the clip states, “OK here’s the start, let’s see how long this thing is.”

He then proceeds to walk all the way down the line, which snakes all around the terminal building.

“This is still just the beginning….we’re just getting started,” he comments.The line stretches right back to the train terminal.“Are you f**king kidding me TSA? What the f**k?” asks the man.Travelers posted images of the line on social media, with some complaining that it took them nearly two hours to get through the checkpoint.James Asher blamed the TSA’s insistence on people removing their belts and shoes for the delays.#TSA: Flew out of Chicago Midway Wed., took 1:45 hours to get thru security. Isn't time to stop with the shoes & belts & computers. Awful!!!— James Asher (@jimasher) May 13, 2016 Last week, the TSA announced that poor staffing would lead to more travel delays this summer.“This is going to be a rough summer; there is no doubt about it,” Gary Rasicot, TSA chief of operations, told the New York Times. “We are probably not at the staffing level we would like to be to address the volume. This is why we are talking about people getting to the airport a little earlier than planned.”Many will see the video as more evidence that airports need to ditch the TSA altogether and hire more efficient, less invasive private screeners.The New York the Port Authority issued an ultimatum earlier this week in a letter that stated, “We can no longer tolerate the continuing inadequacy of TSA passenger screening services. The long waits are prompting complaints from passengers, terminal operators, and airlines alike.”Security expert and former FBI agent Manny Gomez is calling for JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports to take on private screeners.“Privatizing it would hold the people that are selected to be the screeners more accountable. It would cost the federal government infinitely less, and it would make the process a lot more streamlined and seamless,” Gomez told ABC7.SUBSCRIBE on YouTube: Follow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanet!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,'script','twitter-wjs'); Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.
