(North Carolina Wedding-Cake Bakers’ Version) 
If I know that you’re gay, I will not bake a cake,
Bake a cake, bake a cake.
’Cause I’m staying true to Jesus—that I won’t forsake.
So vamoose! Just get out of my sight!
If I know that you’re gay, then you’re not welcome here.
Disappear, disappear.
’Cause you violate the teachings that I hold so dear.
I can say take a hike. It’s my right.		
		

If I know that you’re gay, I will not bake a cake,
Bake a cake, bake a cake.
’Cause I’m staying true to Jesus—that I won’t forsake.
So vamoose! Just get out of my sight!
If I know that you’re gay, then you’re not welcome here.
Disappear, disappear.
’Cause you violate the teachings that I hold so dear.
I can say take a hike. It’s my right.
