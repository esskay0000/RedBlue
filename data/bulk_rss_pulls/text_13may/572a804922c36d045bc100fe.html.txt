 (CNN)Hillary Clinton has an unexpected ally: a former top adviser to John McCain.

the GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks it's on the level. I'm with her.

Any doubt left Trump is completely unhinged? His assertion Ted Cruz's father was associated with Lee Harvey Oswald should remove ALL doubt.

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
