
	Susannah Mushatt Jones, the world's oldest person, has died at the age of 116 years, 311 days.


	The supercentenarian died at 8:26 p.m. Thursday evening at her senior home in Brooklyn, the Gerontology Research Group’s Robert Young told the Daily News.


	She was the last known American to have been born in the 1800s, and there is currently only one verified person in the world to have taken breath in the 19th century.


	GRG, which works with the Guinness Book of World Records, said that the oldest person is now Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, an Italian born on Nov. 29, 1899.


	The queen of King’s County inherited the title of world’s oldest person from Jerlean Telley, a Michigan woman who died last year at the age of 116.


	Jones celebrated her 116th birthday last July with family and friends. Her cake paid tribute to her love of chicken drumsticks and bacon.


	Jones, known to loved ones as “Miss Susie,” told the Daily News last year that she credited her long life to getting sleep, not smoking and not drinking, though she admits that she loves and often eats bacon.


	Her one marriage lasted only briefly, but the woman born during the McKinley administration has more than 100 nieces and nephews.


	Young said that he had met her in April, but that he had only heard her say she was tired.


	Jones was the third American in a row to be able to call the every one else on the planet a whippersnapper.


	The oldest person in America is now Goldie Michelson, a 113-year-old in Massachusetts originally from Russia, according to the GRG.
