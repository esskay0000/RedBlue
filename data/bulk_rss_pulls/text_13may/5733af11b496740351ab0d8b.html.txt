Washington  (CNN)Donald Trump said Wednesday that he may have to start focusing his attention on "Crazy Bernie" Sanders because the Vermont senator keeps beating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in primary contests.

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
