Marco Rubio doesn’t like nearly anything about Donald Trump, but “he’ll support the nominee.”

The Florida senator — who ruled himself out as a possible Trump running mate — told CNN’s Jake Tapper Tuesday that he stands by all of his criticism of Trump, but he will support his party’s nominee because he signed a pledge.

“I’ve signed a pledge that said I’d support the Republican nominee, and I intend to continue to do that,” Rubio said.

But what about all his sharp criticisms of Trump during the campaign?

"I know what I said during the campaign … voters chose a different direction. I stand by the things that I said,” Rubio said.

Tuesday, the Florida senator repeatedly said he’d support Trump (though he kept referring to him as "the nominee" instead of by his name). But when Tapper pressed him if on whether he’d actually vote for Trump, Rubio didn't answer explicitly.

"I'm not voting for Hillary Clinton. I'm not throwing away my vote,” Rubio responded.

Rubio also said he had not decided whether he would attend the July convention in Cleveland, though his decision was not influenced by Trump's nomination.
