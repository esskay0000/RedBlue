Where Hope Finally Made a Comeback

Anti-Trump groups and campaigns spent $75.7 million on 64,000 negative ads against Donald Trump this election cycle. And that’s just broadcast television. Millions more were spent on cable and satellite television ads.

The Never-Trumpers even ran Donald Trump KKK ads – a new low in intraparty fighting.


CNN reported:

The television ad campaign to defeat Donald Trump was at least a $75.7 million effort, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. (Their full estimate: $75,723,580)

It comprised nearly 64,000 ad spots throughout the campaign.

And that’s the figure for broadcast television alone. Anti-Trump ads also ran on cable and satellite television, but the tracking data does not capture that.

A pro-Marco Rubio group spent the most against Trump. Conservative Solutions PAC spent more than one out of every four dollars against Trump — about $19.7 million.

One of their spots — “Serious” — was the most-run anti-Trump ad. It ran 3,939 times.

A pro-Ted Cruz group aired the second-most run anti-Trump ad. “Day One” criticizes Trump among other candidates.

The pro-Jeb Bush super PAC Right to Rise USA spent nearly $10 million, the second-most of any group.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign spent $5.2 million on ads with anti-Trump messages, the most of any presidential candidate on either side of the aisle.

Cruz’s campaign spent more than any other Republican against Trump, some $4.3 million.
