After the Labour Party’s electoral defeat in Britain last year, the party’s small left caucus debated whether it should stand a candidate for the leadership at all. Some feared defeat would expose just how small the caucus was. Others insisted that someone needed to at least raise the arguments against anti-austerity and for a progressive foreign policy to counter the narrative that Labour had lost because it was too progressive.

						});
					
Once the caucus resolved in favor of standing a candidate, the next challenge was to find a candidate. There were few takers. “What about if I stand?” asked Jeremy Corbyn, a consistent socialist standard-bearer over several decades. The question was initially met with silence. But when nobody else came forward, Corbyn got the nod. Then came the final task: getting on the ballot. For that, Corbyn needed 35 members of Parliament to nominate him. With just hours to go before the deadline, he was still several signatures short. With seconds left, his supporters rounded up some parliamentarians who didn’t support him but voted for him anyway, just so the party could have the fullest debate possible.

Nobody—least of all Corbyn—assumed that he would win the debate, let alone the election, with one of the largest majorities of any Labour leader.				
					
					
The trajectory of Corbyn’s ascent—the unlikeliness, pace, and impact of it; the breadth, depth, scale, and insurrectionary nature of it—is emblematic of a broader and growing trend in much of the Western world. In different ways, and to different extents, it is reflected in Bernie Sanders’s campaign for the Democratic nomination, as well as the rise of Podemos in Spain, the Left Bloc in Portugal, and Syriza in Greece. (The fact that Sanders is all but certain to lose is irrelevant. What is remarkable is that he ever had a chance, no matter how slim.)				
					
					
All of these political movements are, of course, different in their own way. Some, like Podemos and Syriza, are relatively new formations, expressing the hope for a different kind of political engagement. Others—the challenges by Sanders and Corbyn in particular—are fronted by older men within established institutions and blend nostalgia for an abandoned social-democratic agenda with the youthful energy of a generation that speaks the language of class almost as fluently as it does that of identity. Some are the product of movements that have grown out of the most recent crisis; others are trying to create movements in order to sustain them.				
					
					
But all have this in common: They have created electoral space on the left where few believed it was possible to thrive, let alone win. In so doing, they have surprised both themselves and their moderate opponents, upending the political certainties of a generation. This new situation poses challenges for everyone.

For a generation, the liberal establishment claimed that radical agendas were self-indulgent precisely because they could not win. “We want to change people’s lives,” went the mantra of Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, and any number of social democrats in between. “But we can’t do that if we’re not in power, and we can’t gain power with a radical agenda.” This, of course, became a self-fulfilling prophecy: No one will vote for those radical policies, so we won’t offer them; since they weren’t offered, no one could vote for them. Pretty much everything could be justified on the basis that the other lot were much worse.				
					
					
This logic no longer holds. In any number of theoretical general-election matchups, Sanders has outshined Hillary Clinton against both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, with double her national lead in the polls. Though Sanders fares worse against John Kasich, this admittedly crude yardstick still suggests he’d win in November.				
					
					
In the United Kingdom, despite hostile media, a parliamentary party in revolt, and considerable self-inflicted wounds, Corbyn has, in the last couple of months, started to lead in the occasional opinion poll. Syriza won reelection in Greece; the Left Bloc is propping up the social-democratic government in Portugal; Podemos is now a serious force in Spain that could, if it joins forces with another radical party (United Left), eclipse the long-established Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party.

This electoral revival on the left is impressive, but hardly decisive. None of this makes victory likely, let alone inevitable in most cases. But it does make these candidacies viable and their agendas quite evidently plausible. It belies the claim “Vote for Bernie and you’ll get Trump.” That line of reasoning was always more of a threat than an argument. But it doesn’t work even as a threat now. The facts simply don’t support it; informed conjecture can no longer sustain it.				
					
					
So the establishment has to own its politics. If it wants to balance budgets on the backs of the poor or deregulate industries to fill the pockets of the rich, it will have to make its case. If, ultimately, it doesn’t seek a society that is fair but one that is merely a bit less unfair, then it should say so rather than hide behind the ostensible will of an electorate that has been offered no other choice. If what masqueraded as pragmatism was really principle in drag, then it deserves to be outed.				
					
					
But, similarly, it falls on the radical left to take itself far more seriously. When it comes to elections, it can no longer act like the dog that chases a car only to end up confounded when it actually catches the vehicle. True, there’s more to politics than elections and more to elections than just winning. But the days of standing for office in order to shift the debate, broaden the base, or just make a point may be over. The debate has shifted; the base has been broadened; the point has been made unmistakably.				
					
					
Radicals now have to take yes for an answer and decide how to employ the electoral strength they’ve marshaled. Having cleared political space through the ballot box, the left must now decide how to build on it.

It belies the claim “Vote for Bernie and you’ll get Trump.” That line of reasoning was always more of a threat than an argument. But it doesn’t work even as a threat now. The facts simply don’t support it; informed conjecture can no longer sustain it.				
					
					
So the establishment has to own its politics. If it wants to balance budgets on the backs of the poor or deregulate industries to fill the pockets of the rich, it will have to make its case. If, ultimately, it doesn’t seek a society that is fair but one that is merely a bit less unfair, then it should say so rather than hide behind the ostensible will of an electorate that has been offered no other choice. If what masqueraded as pragmatism was really principle in drag, then it deserves to be outed.				
					
					
But, similarly, it falls on the radical left to take itself far more seriously. When it comes to elections, it can no longer act like the dog that chases a car only to end up confounded when it actually catches the vehicle. True, there’s more to politics than elections and more to elections than just winning. But the days of standing for office in order to shift the debate, broaden the base, or just make a point may be over. The debate has shifted; the base has been broadened; the point has been made unmistakably.				
					
					
Radicals now have to take yes for an answer and decide how to employ the electoral strength they’ve marshaled. Having cleared political space through the ballot box, the left must now decide how to build on it.				
					
					
		

This logic no longer holds. In any number of theoretical general-election matchups, Sanders has outshined Hillary Clinton against both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, with double her national lead in the polls. Though Sanders fares worse against John Kasich, this admittedly crude yardstick still suggests he’d win in November.				
					
					
In the United Kingdom, despite hostile media, a parliamentary party in revolt, and considerable self-inflicted wounds, Corbyn has, in the last couple of months, started to lead in the occasional opinion poll. Syriza won reelection in Greece; the Left Bloc is propping up the social-democratic government in Portugal; Podemos is now a serious force in Spain that could, if it joins forces with another radical party (United Left), eclipse the long-established Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party.

One thing that absolutely needs to be addressed is voter fraud, not the excuse for disenfranchisement, but rather the machine&apos;s manipulation of vote totals, most obvious in the New York&apos;s Democratic primary. It is clear from exit polls that the Cuomo machine was up to something - either shaving a few points here and there or, more likely, a bald faced reversal of a Sanders&apos; victory. And New York is only one of many cases where the Clinton machine has conspired with state machines to produce outcomes where the popular will has been either shaved or outright denied. The gears of the Democratic machine by which the 1%ers and their lackeys cheat the popular will must be smashed and replaced with a mechanism that is transparent in operation and worthy of the meaning of "Democratic" - "concerning the rule by the common people." Although I will never vote for Hillary Clinton, I will applaud any progress Bernie Sanders makes at the convention in forcing the party to live up to its noble name.

The issues are not going to go away. The will to move them forward will unless there is a new coalition that has some financial power on a sustained basis behind it. Main stream Media is still a powerful bludgeon to keep down progressive ideas so the internet is the outlet of choice for the progressive movement. As long as it stays unregulated.  If Hillary were a man this would be an easy choice for Democrats, they would go with Bernie Sanders. The lure of a woman president is just too much to resist. Feminism is dead.

The extreme emphasis on gender issues (blocking out so many other important issues)  lost the South big time, in the Senate, in 2014.

While it&apos;s true that in Britain and the United States both, the Left has come out on top as of late, at least intellectually and for all intents and purposes practically speaking also.
But this piece strikes me as odd; the U.S. is nothing like the U.K. when it comes to carrying through with left leaning policy.   Add to that the last 36 years the United States has spent in a self destruct mode.   We have so much building to do here, it&apos;s unlikely we will be able to get all that much corrected.   Britain is in a completely different universe at this point in time.

If there is any kind of fairness of the multi-party system in Federal Elections. We will need to invest in election reform, with national rules, methods, mail-in ballot systems and paper back up. We will also need a run-off system, second-round voting (or third, etc., with more than three candidates) when a candidate does not get more than 50% of the vote due to a third party inclusion. Some kind of fair way to get the majority of voters for the winner. Clinton won in 1992 with far less than a majority than Bush in 2000. System unfairness breeds voter apathy. 

 Clinton fans are quite likely to vote for a Sanders Democratic Party presidential candidate, but Sanders supporters will abandon Clinton in droves (but not abandon other progressives running) by either not voting, voting third party, or writing-in Sanders.  Because this Democratic Party primary has been infinitely unfair and Dirty , the closer Sanders gets to Clinton in primary delegates  [popularly-elected] the more intensely Clinton will lose Sanders supporters, in the general election. If Sanders surpasses Clinton in delegates [popularly-elected] the revolution will have arrived.

 California has practically twice as many delegates as any other State (546 delegates.) If Sanders wins Oregon (74 delegates) and California by the same ratio as he did in Washington State (Sanders 74 delegates, to Clinton&apos;s 27) Sanders can seriously challenge her for the nomination. And then there&apos;s New Jersey delegates (146) and some rural Western States.  In W. Virginia, California, S. Dakota, Independents can vote, and Montana, N. Dakota, and Puerto Rico, are open primaries.

The current political & media blitz of "fait accompli" in favor of Hillary Clinton, may add an element of justifiable spite to the mood of voters on the West Coast (and in New Jersey, etc.) voters, who may feel as if they are being treated as insignificant by the machine media & machine politics. This mood would favor Sanders.

I&apos;m a longtime admirer of Mr Younge&apos;s work: his knowledge and understanding of different countries&apos; political landscapes combined with the ability to view it all in historical perspective is impressive. I would like to let him know that those of us who have volunteered on Senator Sanders&apos; presidential campaign are taking "yes" very seriously. We are moving along with the next steps in the political revolution while still working on the Sanders campaign to win as many delegates as possible. This is a very exciting time for those of us who have been registered as (left) third party for decades: it seems as though our path to breaking the two major parties&apos; stranglehold on power is finally clear -- and possible to achieve. And, yes, I am an old fart.

The left should learn from the T-Party. Organize at the local level, and elect candidates to state legislatures; these are the guys who define congressional districts. Also put up good candidates for the House. There will be a lot of vulnerable GOP Reps in the next few cycles.

For one thing, the Left might get its voters not to treat mid-term elections as occasions to play video games, and devote as much or more energy on the state level as it does to demonizing Hillary Clinton.  In terms of electoral strategy, the wingnuts are serious in ways that the Left simply isn&apos;t, and you can see the results in the current composition of Congress.

The Working Families Party is trying to use that general strategy.

Agree with Andy.  Bernie has pushed Clinton to the left. He and supporters should continue to do so, but not in a disparaging. Way. The Bernie movement can use an agreement to support Hillary with full force if she is willing to take some bold positions. But never put her down in public. The Republicans have hammered Trump verbally; it will be used against him by Democrats. Let&apos;s not hand the GOP that kind of ammo against Clinton.

. . . As if the republicans can’t cut her without using a Sanders’ talking point. Not being privy to campaign insiders of either Sanders or the Kissinger Clone, I still think I can infer at least one major reason for why Birdie is in no mood to suspend his campaign for the sake of HRC’s ease of mind, and her cash flow. To this moment, she has offered no unambiguous acknowledgement that she will adopt ANY of  Sanders anti-plutocratic or anti-war arguments. She sees no need to compromise over policies that she rejects. She has triangulated that she is about to stagger over the finish line with her entire neo-con agenda intact. Sanders’ only path is to attempt to make her intransigence as painful as possible. I made two small donations to Birdie’s campaign this week, my hope being that some honorable faction of the FBI can act to derail HRC’s train by holding her accountable for the corrupt dealing she hid via her unsupervised, unsecured, and disingenuous email conduit for bribes, kickbacks, and extortion while Secretary of State.

I do not see that Hillary has moved much to the left.  Only a tiny a bit on Free Trade and in her general rhetoric.  In reality, she is the same candidate she has always been: center-right.  Any move to the left will only be in word and not in deed.  She is far more likely to shift to the right and try to pick up with Jeb-type Republicans with whom she has far more in common.

You got it!!
