 With the positive in my journey, there is also negative. Need to make changes for all in ‚ôøÔ∏è. @denairport @tsa pre check officer was rude, and in correct. Said every airport in country BUT Den is doing it wrong. Had a full body pat down, and was humiliated by him as well. Thank you STSO Keith Rogers!!! I'm going to find out if the rest of the country is wrong, or if HE is wrong. I'll get back to you. üòò

 I have to say a big THANK YOU to @denairport TSA for making sure they are trained for people with disabilities. I'm not a lightning rod, but I can and will speak out to help others who are afraid to speak out. #ADA #SCI #EqualityForAll #TSA
