WASHINGTON House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday said a range of options to provide funds to fight Zika, adding that lawmakers take the threat seriously but have not yet decided the best way to allocate resources to prevent and combat the deadly virus.

"We're looking at all different options," adding that the White House has begun providing congressional staff with answers to questions over President Barack Obama's funding request. "The administration has a bit of a track record of over-requesting what they need."
