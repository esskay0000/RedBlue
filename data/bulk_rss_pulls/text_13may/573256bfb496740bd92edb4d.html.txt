Joe Biden didn't offer a formal endorsement in the Democratic race, but he did offer a prediction: He's "confident" that Hillary Clinton will win the race for president.

“I feel confident that Hillary will be the nominee, and I feel confident she’ll be the next president,” the vice president said in an interview with ABC News that was posted Tuesday.

While the statement is not an endorsement, this is the most explicit Biden (who weighed a presidential run himself) has been during the campaign. President Obama also has declined to formally back a candidate while the primaries are ongoing.
