Hillary Clinton is already capitalizing on Donald Trump's controversial role within his party.

The campaign for the former secretary of State released an ad Wednesday that features multiple prominent Republicans bashing Donald Trump — who as of Tuesday night is the party’s expected nominee.

The clips are juxtaposed with Trump talking about how he is a uniter of the party.

The ad was released just as Clinton’s campaign shot out an email that included quotes from dozens of Republicans vowing not to check Trump’s name at the polls.
