 (CNN)Donald Trump's newly minted convention manager on Sunday accused Republican presidential rival Ted Cruz's campaign of "Gestapo tactics" and of "not playing by the rules" in its efforts to wrangle the support of Republican delegates.

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!
