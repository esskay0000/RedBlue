 “WTF? Pennsylvania State Police license plate reader SUV camouflaged as Google Street View vehicle,” Blaze wrote on Twitter.The photo, which quickly gained several hundred retweets, also shows two cameras on top of the vehicle believed to be LPRs or “License Plate Readers.”Speaking with Gizmodo writer Matt Novak, Pennsylvania State Trooper Adam Reed confirmed the equipment to be LPRs although he and the department denied owning the SUV.
Matt, this is not a PSP vehicle. If this is LPR technology, other agencies and companies might make use of it. https://t.co/ekJrN4lF2h— PA State Police (@PAStatePolice) May 11, 2016 According to Blaze, the vehicle was not only parked near multiple marked police cars but even had a Pennsylvania State Police parking placard in the window and a “LoJack antenna array on the roof.”Plot thickens. Car was def. law enf & had a @PAStatePolice parking placard, but they say it isn’t one of theirs. https://t.co/WGQLuVrTUz— matt blaze (@mattblaze) May 11, 2016 Those discussing the photo speculated the SUV could belong to anyone from a repo company to a tow operator or bounty hunter.“My experience is that this is either a tow operator or bounty hunter abusing a parking placard. Happens all the time in NYC,” one Twitter user wrote.Twitter users, noting the potential legal issues surrounding the misuse of Google’s logo, alerted the tech company to the vehicle. Google has thus far refrained from making any public statements on the issue.
