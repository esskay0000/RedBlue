During this year’s presidential primary, New Yorkers across the state discovered something that voting-rights advocates have been saying for years: Despite the state’s progressive reputation, New York’s elections are a mess.

Demand a Change to New York's Terrible Voting Laws

Take Action Now!

Approximately 120,000 people were inexplicably purged from the voting rolls in Kings County. Others had their party affiliation switched without their knowledge—leaving them unable to vote in New York’s closed primary. Polling places didn’t open on time or closed early. And millions didn’t get to vote because they did not register with the Republican or Democratic Party—a decision they would have had to make by October 9, 2015, 193 days before the primary.		
All of this led to an embarrassingly low turnout: As Ari Berman pointed out at The Nation, with 19.7 percent of eligible voters casting a ballot, New York had the second-lowest turnout this primary season, second only to Louisiana.		
Even before Tuesday’s debacle, voting-rights advocates have been fighting for reforms that could change this. One law introduced in the legislature, the Voter Empowerment Act, would implement automatic voter registration, expand online registration, ensure that voters’ registration moves when they do, introduce pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds, and create registration opportunities at more government agencies—all changes that would make the process of registration and changing one’s registration easier and more streamlined.		
But that’s not all we need. People in states like North Carolina were rightly outraged when their statehouses cut down on their early voting days, but New York State doesn’t have early voting at all. This needs to change. Allowing voters to cast their ballot on more than one day—a weekday, no less—is absolutely necessary if we are to ensure every citizen can participate in our democracy.		
And finally, we need to move both the deadline to register AND the deadline to change one’s party affiliation closer to election day. Same-day voter registration—while it would require a state constitutional amendment to implement—would be ideal and ensure that even voters who are moved to participate at the last minute can exercise their constitutional rights. At the very least, the deadlines to register and change one’s party affiliation need to be moved as close as possible to election day.

It is very annoying that persons outside of New York are not permitted to sign on to this.  After all, results of national elections in New York affect everyone in the country!

I&apos;m reading this from Colorado and can&apos;t tell you how grateful I am for the article since the same situation is present in Colorado, but little was ever reported about it.

There should be a national law for voting in Presidential elections.  Mail-in voting has worked in Oregon, and has been hugely popular for about 20 years.  If you don&apos;t get a ballot in the mail, you still have two weeks after get it,  to register, before the election.  Polls still open on election day but nobody has to stand in line.  Which party will pick up this lucrative  ball and run with it first?

It&apos;s not just New York. Arizona&apos;s in the spotlight this week for two lawsuits about last month&apos;s Presidential Preference Election.

I actually see 2 different threads here:
1) Voters names disappearing from check-lists, and status being mysteriously changed (throw in polls not opening when they should or certain politicians violating laws around polling places without consequence if you like).
2) restrictive voting rules determined by private groups (political parties) then enacted through government run (and tax-payer funded) election/voting mechanism.
I don&apos;t see how we can recognize the first, and yet still accept the results of the elections.
I don&apos;t see how we can use the government voting mechanism at taxpayer expense to reinforce the dominance of two political parties which are private entities.
Finally, I don&apos;t see how we can get out of either trap, particularly since the candidates they favor keep returning to power, with obviously no incentive to question the mechanisms that give them power.
After all, they keep "Winning," so anyone who challenges that result should bow out, or at least  "Tone it Down."

The Green Party and good government groups have been calling for such reform for a long time. They have been ignored by everyone, including liberal Democrats. Now that their flavor of the month has been impacted, they are finally "discovering" this for themselves. Better late than never, I suppose.

Were the "Greens" impacted by these stories?
Dn&apos;t get me wrong, I am a fan of the "Greens" and have cast a vote their way when they were the candidate on the ballot most aligned with my views.  But the Greens have a lot of work to do before they get to a position where voter check-lists are their biggest concern.
Please, build an organization that can offer viable candidates.  Lots of us are rooting for you!

p.s. Clinton won in 1992 with only 43.0% of the popular vote.  Bush got 37.4%; Ross Perot 18.9% .  A runoff election round would have been truly Democratic, and fair to ALL voters.

We need a national runoff (second round) for National elections.  The two party monopoly won&apos;t do it because they both rely on Big Business and corporate media to promote and finance election campaigns.  Until we have this election reform, third parties are going to have to be big enough "spoilers" to open the system to a multi-party system.  Bill Clinton won in 1992, when a fiscal conservative ran independently, cutting the Republican vote.  "The Elephant" never forgot, but instead of getting mad about it, they should have made this kind runoff reform.  Party insurgents like Bernie, could run in their own party, instead of taking votes on the "first round" (presently, the only "round") from the establishment party - advantages and disadvantages to the two establishment parties balance out, but their super-rich Benefactors would be against  it, because it would cost them too much to "buy off" more than two parties.  Fairness in democracy is not a business model for them.

“AN INDISPENSABLE VOICE IN OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE.”
