naturally unsalted (enough to make		
a grown man cry, remembering sweet

on a wall that may or may not have been Dover,

never, never, never, never:		
the line lies in trochaic pieces
on the floor, and, for all their pretty speeches,		
they cannot put it back together
again, the king’s men (This feather
stirs; she lives!),
the King’s Men.
