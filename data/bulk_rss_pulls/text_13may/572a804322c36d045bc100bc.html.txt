A Texas expression for this is that the electorate is as confused as a "colony of termites in a yo-yo." It appears that political commentators actually think that the hullabaloo is about an election, so they concentrate on Mickey Mouse campaign tactics. It is about much more than that, and the chaos will continue after the election.

Utterly, totally original and stunningly pithy.
Thank you Tom Tomorrow!!!
