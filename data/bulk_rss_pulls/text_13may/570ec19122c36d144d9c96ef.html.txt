Early voting begins Thursday in Maryland, 12 days before the state will hold Democratic and Republican primaries that include the White House, an open U.S. Senate seat, eight Congressional races and mayor of Baltimore.

Early voting runs through April 21, the Thursday before the April 26 primary.

Anyone can register to vote in person during the early voting period. But they will have to record their votes on paper. Plans to use electronic voting machines were scrapped over concerns that, on touch screens, voters would have trouble finding the names of candidates far down on the ballot.

 [Md. ditches early-voting machines that don’t display all candidates’ names] 

Rep. Chris Van Hollen, in a close race against Rep. Donna Edwards for the Democratic Senate nomination, is holding a campaign event Thursday morning in his rival’s home base of Prince George’s County to encourage early votes and highlight his support from female African-American elected leaders.

Edwards is kicking off early voting day in Van Hollen’s district, greeting commuters at the Metro station in Silver Spring.

In the Democratic primary for Baltimore mayor, state Sen. Catherine E. Pugh leads the race in polling, followed closely by former mayor Sheila Dixon. 

Both U.S. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Councilman Nick J. Mosby, the latter a mayoral candidate himself until Wednesday, have endorsed Pugh.

A total of 105,339 Democrats and 34,112 Republicans turned out to vote early in 2014’s gubernatorial primaries, a fraction of eligible voters. But elections officials are anticipating more interest this year because of the mayoral, Senate and presidential primaries being held together.

The early voting period might be particularly important this year for some Jewish voters, because the primaries fall in the middle Passover.
