 The inside track on Washington politics.

California Republicans were really excited about the prospect of their votes deciding the Republican nomination contest. How could they not be! A state that often votes late enough that its picks don't really make much difference. This time, though? Every estimate of how the delegate math might shake out suggested that we'd be up until the wee hours of the night (Pacific time) on June 7, watching returns pile up in each of the state's 53 congressional districts.

And then Ted Cruz had to go and elbow his way out of the race.

Now it seems likely that no one will care that much anymore, and in California's top-two-finishers-regardless-of-party primary system, that's bad news for the Republicans. (Especially since the Democrats will still be scrapping by then.)

But is that true? In this year of record turnout on the Republican side, which has powered both Donald Trump and non-Donald-Trump candidates to new heights in total vote counts, might that riptide of support for the presumptive nominee not still draw people to the polls?

Cruz dropped out the evening of May 3, making Trump the presumptive nominee. Since then, there have been two contests: West Virginia and Nebraska. Turnout in both states was up over both 2008 and 2012 — but turnout in West Virginia (using early numbers from the AP) was up more than the median increase we've seen so far this year. Turnout in Nebraska was only up slightly.





Notice in those charts, which are oriented in order from earliest contest (Iowa) to most recent, that there hasn't been any sort of consistent increase even as candidates have dropped out. Turnout was down in Utah, since Mitt Romney wasn't on the ballot this year, but up in the Northeast, since Trump was. It's sort of all over the place. Nebraska's increase — at far right — is one of the smallest we've seen, but it was still up.

But why? Maybe West Virginia turnout was up because weeks of ads and outreach ginned up momentum and interest in the race. Maybe Nebraska turnout was down for some unrelated reason. It's hard to tell from one night of information.

So let's jump back four years. In 2012, the results were similarly mixed after Romney became the presumptive nominee this month. Some up. Some down.



What's been consistent, though, is that the Republicans this year keep turning out with much larger increases than the Democrats. The Democrats only had one state in which they saw a big increase over their last contested contest: Michigan, where in 2008 Obama wasn't even on the ballot. (We explored why after the polls in that state this year were so wrong.) Everywhere else, turnout was down.



The state of the race hasn't changed much on the Democratic side since Iowa, and turnout patterns haven't either.

Earlier this year, I speculated that this might be due to the fact that Clinton was so heavily favored for so long. In past contests where there's been a heavy favorite, turnout has similarly been down. (I also noted that there wasn't any link between lower turnout and worse performance in November, though the sample size is very small.) If that's the case, we should expect to see less enthusiasm for Trump over time — though West Virginia belies that.

For California Republicans, though, that's little consolation. "Maybe your turnout won't be completely obliterated after all!" is not a phrase that one would consider reassuring. But don't blame me. Blame Ted Cruz.
