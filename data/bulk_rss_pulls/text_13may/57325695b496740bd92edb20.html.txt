A pea-sized device that produces weak pulses of electricity is being tested as a treatment for migraine.

The StimRelieve Halo system consists of a tiny implant inserted into the forehead, just under the skin, and a battery which clips to the ear and sends electric pulses to it wirelessly.

More than 140 people are taking part in a U.S. trial, where they will have the implant fitted, but half won't have the batteries activated. Patients can trigger an electric signal using a button on the battery.

Migraines are thought to result from abnormal brain activity, which temporarily affects nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels, leading to pain. The idea is that the electrical pulses block or interfere with pain signals.

Could rapeseed oil lower cholesterol?

Switch to rapeseed oil to cut your cholesterol levels. That's the suggestion from researchers at St Boniface General Hospital in Canada, who are leading a study of 100 people with metabolic syndrome.

This condition is an early stage of cardiovascular disease, where patients have a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. High levels of bad cholesterol can make their illness worse.

Patients will add 25g of rapeseed oil, or a placebo alternative of vegetable oil, to their diet for 12 weeks, and cholesterol levels will be monitored with blood tests.

Rapeseed oil is understood to contain less saturated fat and more omega-3 fatty acids than most other vegetable oils, and these are thought to help reduce the risk of inflammatory illnesses and heart disease.

How fibre can add years to your life

Eating more fibre could increase your life expectancy.

Researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China analysed the results of 17 studies, and found that people with the highest levels of dietary fibre were 16 per cent less likely to die prematurely than those who ate the least, according to the results published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Based on data from nearly a million people, they show that there was a 10 per cent drop in risk for each additional 10g of fibre in the diet.

High-fibre foods such as whole grains help you feel full sooner, and for longer, which helps curb overeating.

They're also thought to lower the risk of chronic conditions including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers.
