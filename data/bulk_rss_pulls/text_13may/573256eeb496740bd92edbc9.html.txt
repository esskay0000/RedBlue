“Well hello, Joe, what do you know?
Got any patter for my vaudeville show?”
“I can’t believe you’re asking me, Ted,
When that ‘nest of Muslims’ is knocking ’em dead.”
“Should I reuse my carpet-bomb line—
Say I’ll make the Mexican border sands shine?”
“Great. Or trump that with a ‘Latino-ISIS axis’?
You know—‘Isn’t that what’s driven up taxes?’”
“YES!! After all, ‘Have you no decency, sir’
Has long since stopped being a slur!”
[drumroll, rimshot, hook]

wonderful! both text and artwork.

... it&apos;s "ringshot". Otherwise, very clever. Especially now that the RedState audience has been gassed. I almost feel sorry for really honest Republicans. Nowhere to go.

All the remaining true republicans have is the ability to pay attention in the future. The poor fools were bushwhacked by the tea baggers.

Thier historic lockstep march into the future via the 18th century is over.
