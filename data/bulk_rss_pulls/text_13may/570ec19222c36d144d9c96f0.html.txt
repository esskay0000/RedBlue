When Donald Trump went on "Fox and Friends" on Monday morning, he shared some strange news: Two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, won't be able to vote for him in New York's April 19 Republican primary.

Wait, really? How did that happen?

In the most basic terms, they missed the registration deadline. But while the three Trumps have spent the week saying they "didn't register to vote" in time, it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. Ivanka has said several times that she's a registered independent, because she prefers to vote for individual candidates over broader party platforms. Her brother Eric has also indicated he's registered as an independent.

The problem for them is that New York has very restrictive laws around switching one's party affiliation. While new voters were permitted to register up until March 25 – less than a month before the primary – the deadline for switching party affiliations was way back on October 9 of last year.

That still doesn't mean it would have been tough to make the switch to the party that, you know, their dad will probably represent as presidential nominee. As an experiment, I went through the whole process at my desk this morning. It involved printing out a PDF document (which New Yorkers can pick up from county election board offices or some state agencies), then filling it out by hand. It took two minutes, to the second (full disclosure – I didn't fill it out with my real information. My name isn't "John Post," and my Social Security number certainly doesn't end in "1-2-3-4.")

Yes, New York has some weird deadlines for switching party affiliation. And yes, any one of us could have made the mistake that Eric and Ivanka Trump did. But most of us aren't the children of major party candidates for president.

As The Fix's Philip Bump wrote on Monday, the Trump campaign has an organization problem, from the delegate battle right on down. If his own kids – who, by their own admission, have participated quite actively in this campaign – can't get voter registration right, it could be a sign that the rest of the Trump campaign is seriously lacking in organization, too.
