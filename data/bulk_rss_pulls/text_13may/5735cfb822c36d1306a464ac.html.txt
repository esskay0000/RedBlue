Trump: Amazon's Bezos uses Washington Post to avoid taxes


         NEW YORK        (AP) -- Donald Trump says Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is using his newspaper to help the online retailer avoid taxes.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tells Fox News that Bezos is "using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don&apos;t tax Amazon like they should be taxed."

The comments came after the newspaper&apos;s associate editor, Bob Woodward, was quoted as saying the Post has "20 people working on Trump." The newspaper has also announced plans to publish a book on Trump.

In a statement, Post executive editor Martin Barron says he&apos;s "received no instructions from Jeff Bezos" regarding campaign coverage, and the decision to write a book came from the newsroom. Amazon didn&apos;t immediately respond to a request for comment.
