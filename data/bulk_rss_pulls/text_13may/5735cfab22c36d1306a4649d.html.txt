Donald Trump arrived at the Republican National Committee on Thursday to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan. The meeting was highly, highly anticipated since last week, when Ryan announced he could not yet support his own party’s nominee.

MSNBC had a countdown clock for the meeting on Wednesday, and at one point around 9 a.m. Thursday (shortly after Trump and his entourage arrived), all three major networks — Fox News, CNN and MSNBC — were streaming live video of the scene outside of the building.

But it wasn’t just the networks following the meeting with breathless anticipation; Washington journalists of all media types were tuned in. Here are some of the most interesting press tweets from the scene:
