Why have most African-American voters, especially in the Southern states, steadfastly supported Hilary Clinton in the Democratic primaries? This question has bedeviled supporters of Bernie Sanders, who has a long record of support for racial justice and whose economic policies would arguably benefit blacks more than Clinton’s. As a Sanders supporter and a scholar who has devoted much of my career to studying the African-American experience, I have wondered about this myself. I have been disturbed, however, by the faintly patronizing tone of some of these discussions.

Last week I spoke in Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, at a public symposium on the post–Civil War era of Reconstruction. The audience of a few hundred was one of the most racially integrated I have encountered of late. Of course, this was a self-selected group interested in history, not a representative sample of the voting population. But I came away with a deeper understanding of this electoral phenomenon.				
					
					
Needless to say, I cannot speak for black voters or for any individual’s choice of candidate other than my own. But I think that Sanders supporters too frequently fail to understand the conditions facing African Americans today, especially in Republican-controlled states like South Carolina. If you are a black Carolinian you know that politics is almost entirely polarized along racial lines. You have seen your governor (supposedly a forward-looking Republican) reject the expansion of Medicaid, which would enormously benefit low-income people of all races, but especially blacks. Your legislature has enacted laws designed to discourage voting by non-whites. You know that half a century after “integration” in a state where blacks make up over a quarter of the population, they represent only 10 percent of the students at the University of South Carolina and 7 percent at Clemson, the flagship public universities.				
			

							For black Carolinians, the challenge today seems to be holding on to gains that are under assault rather than seeking further progress.
						
 
Those with an interest in history note that public representations of the state’s past almost entirely ignore the black population and that large numbers of whites are dismissive of efforts to memorialize slavery, Reconstruction, or the Jim Crow era. On the grounds of the state Capitol the Confederate flag, once prominently displayed, has been removed, but in the two dozen or so remaining monuments and markers, including the lone “African-American History Monument,” the only black person mentioned by name is Essie, the mixed-race daughter out of wedlock of Senator Strom Thurmond. When local politicians—and jurists all the way up to the Supreme—invoke the idea of state sovereignty, African Americans hear the voice of John C. Calhoun, Ben Tillman, and Thurmond himself. “Why are some people urged to ‘never forget,’” asked one member of the audience, “while we are constantly being told to ‘get over it’?”				
					
					
Of course, significant changes have taken place in the past half-century. But for black Carolinians, the challenge today seems to be holding on to gains that are under assault rather than seeking further progress. It is not surprising that voters in this situation prefer a familiar candidate who seems to promise progress, even if incremental, rather than a lesser-known insurgent from a virtually all-white state with a sweeping but seemingly utopian agenda.

Black voters, moreover, are extremely protective of President Obama. They recognize, more viscerally than many whites, how much of the invective hurled at the president has a racist tinge. No white president has been forced to produce his birth certificate to demonstrate his citizenship or been interrupted during a State of the Union address and accused of lying. When Obama is called “lazy” or a “food-stamp president,” the language, among blacks, evokes stereotypes deeply rooted in America’s racial past. To some extent, when blacks vote for Clinton they are casting one last ballot for Obama.				
					
					
Given all of the above, black support for Clinton is understandable. Sanders has done a remarkable thing in propelling economic inequality to the center stage of political discourse, thereby galvanizing support among young white voters, and some young blacks. But older African Americans have known about inequality for a long, long time.				
					
					
Whatever the outcome of this election, one lesson of our history is clear: No progressive movement in this country can succeed without a significant base of support in the black community.

I read this article twice and failed to find any reason for blacks to vote for Hillary Clinton as opposed to Bernie Sanders.  White liberals, including the Clintons have indeed betrayed black citizens.  Maybe it&apos;s time to vote for a white socialist.

Southern black voters have known and worked with Hillary for over twenty years. They, too, went through the crack epidemic in the 1990s. They understand. 
Most of them have never heard of Bernie. That is fair, as Bernie has never approached them. I live in the Commonwealth next to Bernie. We have cities with sizable black and/or Hispanic populations. Bernie has spent his career in a world 98% white.

It is not America.

Because they enjoy being the principal victims of the War on Some Drugs and being called super-predators?

How many tons of cocaine and heroin were shipped to black America with the compliance/support/assist of the CIA and the US Govt.?

I&apos;m afraid that, while the many points raised here about racist attitudes and actions, particularly, but by no means only, in the South, are more than valid, none of them add up to the backing that Clinton has received from the African-American community.

Aside from the disastrous crime, drug and welfare policies signed into law by Bill Clinton, and thoroughly supported by Hillary, the Clinton &apos;08 run at the nomination devolved into all manner of slurs and innuendo against Obama when it began to dawn on them that they might lose – from pushing the Muslim allusion already being deployed by the Republican opposition, to outright race-baiting and naked appeals to white voters in the South who would recognize the language Clinton employed as racially charged.   All this was both blatant and precisely the sort of thing that, now, Professor Foner is pointing to as reasons for Clinton&apos;s support in black communities.

Add to that what had to have been a new low in modern political speech, when, after being asked why she did not step aside when it had become clear she would lose the nomination to Obama, Hillary said that some nominations had not been decided until June, then noted her husband&apos;s own nomination and the turn of events precipitated by the assassination of RFK.   Never mind that it was a foregone conclusion that Bill Clinton had secured the nomination by March, though it has not become official until June.  The obvious and crucial point in her statement, originally made in March &apos;08 in an interview with Time magazine, and subsequently repeated again in May of that year to the editorial board of the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, was the fear that had been on everyone&apos;s mind from the outset, and precisely the reason that President Obama had received a security detail earlier on than any previous candidate.

I think the main reason for Clinton&apos;s support among the black community has been two-fold.  First, there was the blatant media blackout on Bernie, even as he drew crowds that far outnumbered Trump&apos;s, never mind Clinton&apos;s.  But the media feeding frenzy on what had quickly become one of the more ridiculous campaigns in my lifetime {I&apos;m 67} helped to keep many voters designating "unknown" or "not sure" and the like in poll after poll well into December of last year.  The second and more devastating reason that kept Clinton&apos;s numbers high among blacks was as much a product of the obvious circling of the wagons by the Democratic establishment, including the most prominent black leaders in Congress, who, together, saw {and see} Bernie Sanders&apos;s candidacy as a significantly greater threat to the Party and the status quo and, therefore, were more than ready to forgive Clinton whatever bad-mouthing  she may have dished up at Obama in &apos;08, or whatever bad policies she may have been guilty of supporting a little too enthusiastically while Bill presided.  

On a more positive note, the fact that Bernie went from virtually no support in the black community to as much as 25% - 30% in the time that he did, and the fact that he has garnered the support of figures like Ben Jealous and Spike Lee, Michelle Alexander and Harry Belafonte, Nina Turner and Danny Glover, Keith Ellison and Jumaane Williams, and many more, shows that his policies and his vision appeal to a broad cross-section of the population.  In that light, one can&apos;t help but wonder how Bernie might have fared if voter turnout in the black community, and in the community more generally, was anywhere near as high as it could and should be.  There&apos;s no question that, if independents were allowed to vote in some of these closed and semi-closed primaries, things would looking very different right now.

Assuming the author is right - then the black leaders are betraying their communities and for what purpose that would be is easy to guess: money, favors from Clinton, which they are not likely to get from Bernie who does not believe in crony capitalism. What is most alarming is that southern blacks have in essence capitulated: they no longer believe that if you fight you will in time reach your goal and that Bernie is offering to lead that fight for social justice, equally good schools and jobs for all, including blacks. Applied equal rights, not just a sound without a substance. 

It seems to me that from the candidates running, they know Hillary best and because she proposes to build on what Obama did, they see her as the safer bet. Unfortunately, that will likely be a disappointment. Hillary is entirely corporate. The poor really don&apos;t interest her and today the "poor" include large portions of the middle class.

Incrementalism may seem the safer bet. But when you look at Hillary&apos;s political career, the only increments she has actively pursued is money and power for herself. She claims she has been fighting for the middle class all her life - but what has she really done for the middle class? Bill Clinton got the economy humming again by rebuilding from the bottom. Yes. But that isn&apos;t Hillary&apos;s merit. She emphasizes her work for the children&apos; defense fund. But in reality that was her first job out of law school for a year or two. And not all who experienced her work for that fund admire her work.

What is left? Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yement, Syria, Somalia, Central Africa, and Honduras. None is a success unless you consider permanent destruction,  impoverishment and destabilization "the success". Afghanistan under the Russians actually treated males and females completely equal and young female students openly discuss with male students without head coverings. Hillary talked a lot of empowering Afghan women - but what has really materialized? Not much. The US problem is the it wants to use religion as means to divide and keep destabilized and once religion is center piece, equality of gender has no room anymore.

As to Obama, he is really entirely pro corporate elite and special interests. Neither he nor Michelle affirmed Afro-American culture and looks. How much more interesting would Michelle have come across as with a large Afro hairdo! Instead, she goes out of her way to emulate hairdos of white women. 

When will blacks stop trying to emulate whites and instead affirm their own looks and ways of life? And that seems to me really where the Black South suffers: they have experienced so much discrimination that they no longer give themselves a right to be equal and insist on equal opportunities and rights and education and everything else.

I am admirer of Eric Foner"s scholarship, and I&apos;m glad to hear he supports Bernie Sanders, but this is a very disappointing piece.  It is a mere listing of some of the outrages black people experience in this country, but Professor Foner owes us an explanation for why these are good reasons to vote for Hillary Clinton, who never distanced herself from her husbands record, which included the destruction of our welfare system, the massive incarceration of black people, and the financial deregulation that brought us the biggest recession since the Great Depression. Does speaking in black churches and verbally recognizing some of the obstacles black people face in this country make up for this dismal record?  Is it not worth mentioning the similarity between the role of the aging civil rights leadership and the black clergy, and that of the Democratic Party establishment.  Surely this black elite is not ignorant of the impact of Clinton era policies on their community.

I haven&apos;t even read the article.  But I want to ask how Hillary Clinton will help African American voters?  What has she done to show that she will promote the interests of African Americans?

Maybe I have missed this part of her campaign rhetoric.  But I have seen nothing that makes me think that her number one concern is the well-being of the African American community.  Am I wrong?

There is an elephant in the room here, that nobody wants to touch including me. I will leave that elephant to one of the Black intellectual leaders to throw out there in a postmortem. Perhaps Brother West or Michelle Alexander, or more fittingly Ben Jealous. On every issue and over a long history any objective observer would have to say that Sanders is the better choice for Blacks, for the poor, the working class.  Van Jones pointed out the other day that 10% of Blacks could vote for Trump a figure that could lead to defeat even against Trump.  
Ten percent WHAT!!!!!!!!!!

Hillary got 85 percent of the Black vote in some States ,90% in Mississippi. So while you are pontificating to the absurd. Please somebody tell me what Trump has to offer that puts him even in the same ball park as the most progressive member of the US congress, on almost every issue. 

Lets rephrase that. What is it about Sanders that makes him so unpopular especially among elderly Blacks in the deep South their goes that elephant again.

simple, the corrupt --but still humming-- democRatic machine is the only thing between (dixie) blacks and renewed lynching --or at least that&apos;s the dems&apos; dog whistle.  

the dems extortionate black voters with fear of dixie2.0 and muzzle+puppet-master the black misleadership through cameo jobs inside the plantation&apos;s main house.

Anti-semitism

Well, maybe he&apos;s not. Maybe he&apos;s simply not popular, as in "not known."

Look, It&apos;s entirely possible to prefer one candidate without demonizing another -- though the hateful discourse of the current election cycle might have one think otherwise.

There

Many of the commenters are missing the point. They, like the author and myself, are Bernie supporters who are not Southern African-Americans. Of course his comments are no more compelling to them than they are to the author.

At some point we&apos;ll be treated to an article in The Nation or some other progressive rag that asks African Americans who support Sanders why we do. And hopefully such a treat will focus on policy rather than somehow turn on why we don&apos;t support HRC. Maybe it&apos;ll even ponder the question, "what kind of work/organizing is needed to build upon such support in order to create a critical mass of African American progressives untethered to the Democratic Party?" Can&apos;t wait to read that!

I was amazed to discover in the comments that Foner is supporting Bernie. This article seems to be damning Sanders with (very) faint praise while supporting Clinton by undermining any logical reasoning.

As to Obama, he has been anything but a strong supporter of African Americans--not a single banker prosecuted even though people of color were much more damaged by the crash than whites; Obama&apos;s  loan modification program, HAMP, was a disaster; Ta-Nehisi Coates has written extremely cogent critiques on how Obama has had a dismissive attitude toward blacks (men especially). 

Clinton&apos;s history has been one of supporting her husband&apos;s destruction of welfare and institution of mass incarceration, while her support for women&apos;s rights does not extend past the US border (see her (and Obama&apos;s) support of the Honduran coup that led directly to the thousands of women and children flooding the US/Mexico border in 2014 fleeing what had become the murder capital of the world, along with increasing instability in the the middle east, north Africa and southwest Asia, along with her support for the increasing attacks by Israel on Palestinians.

How does Foner think anything in Clinton&apos;s history--especially her dishonest adoption of Sanders&apos; policies to try to garner some support from the Democratic left and her pandering to African Americans despite her actual record--makes her a preferable candidate to anyone but a Republican?

I don&apos;t think the argument here is very strong. The notion of familiarity and old connections to Bill Clinton are less persuasive as the primary season progresses. Unfortunately, Bernie has not done a great job making the case for economic equality as a means to social equality. I&apos;m not sure that the argument would play well in the south anyway. But the same shot at a college education and an economic  boost in the black middle class might make do a lot change the racial disparities that intersect with economic issues.

It may take another four years for it too sink to the African-American community.

Most comments seem to argue against your arguments  as to why the Black South voted overwhelmingly for Hillary.  I agree with most of the comments but do appreciate your attempt in answering this perplexing question .  But the commentary did a better job explaining why.

Sadly, Mr. Foner&apos;s conclusión is bia sed in favor of Ms. Clinton. Here&apos;se why! He posits, rightly, that Mr. Sanders has done a remarkable thing by propelling the issue of inequality center stage; then he continues -again rightly- that older African-Americans have long been aware of this reality. Were he not biased his conclusion should have suggested support of Mr. Sanders and not Ms. Clinton. Ms. Clinton has never, in my recollection, brought that issue Center Stage. She did not do so  in her race against Mr. Obama; rather, she questioned his capability of being Commander in Chief.  In a fair fight-- no polemical political historical  spin of the media or bias of Democratic Party Establishment  -- I would argue that Bernie beats Hillary. Consider the tightness of the race. Wow!

I was surprised at how weak Foner&apos;s case was for justifying support for Clinton.  I read the article twice to make sure I didn&apos;t miss something important.  I agree with your comment entirely.

Why do African Americans overwhelming prefer Hilary Clinton?  Why do blue collar whites prefer the Republicans?  Why do so many Americans seem to vote against their economic interests?   My best guess is that Americans are low information voters.  Until Americans decide otherwise, they will be subject to  manipulation by politicians who exploit their ignorance.

The last comment by Anthony Margraf says it all. There is no rational reason for African Americans to support Hillary Clinton. 
This is just another example of how the South is negatively different than the rest of the country.

This author must have amnesia, the Clinton&apos;s have done more harm to the African American community than any candidate presently running for the presidency, the CRIME BILL, THE WELFARE REFORM BILL, DEREGULATION OF WALL STREET AND THE BANKS i.e. the great recession that harmed the minority citizens the most, Sanders has never harmed the same citizens in any way and was involved in civil rights long before Hillary showed  up, in fact Hillary was still supporting Goldwater  after the civil rights bills bills were passes i n the 1960&apos;s WAKE UP TO HILARY"S COMPLETE DISHONESTY

During President Clinton&apos;s term of office, the largest migration in human history occurred and went unnoticed and that was the movement of blacks from lower class to middle class.  Don&apos;t say nothing was done to help the African Americans.

During Secretary Clinton&apos;s term of office, the largest migration in Europe occurred, since the Second World War, in part, as a result of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, which is itself "foreign" to most "low information" American citizens.

So basically, you are suggesting that it takes a Southern Democrat from a racist state to understand the plight of African Americans in those states.  Mind boggling logic!

If you are replying to Christopher Ross says:	
 April 26, 2016 at 12:35 pm, "So very sad. And not at all unlike the white working class men who also vote against their best interests,"  then you missed the point. I think Ross means, the culture and the media in The South effect both poor blacks and poor whites in a similar way, like religious fundamentalism, for example.

It&apos;s all about Bill playing the sax, I guess?  Not about him overseeing the execution of a black, mentally retardrd man? Or mass incarceration? The younger black voters largely are not buying the Clinton jibe talk.

So very sad. And not at all unlike the white working class men who also vote against their best interests.

If the fear is “It can always get worse”, you will not reach any mountain top.

The fear of “It can always get worse”, will also keep you from doing something stupid, like falling off a cliff.  What exactly is your point ?

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/black-caucus-pac-donna-edwards-219214   Black Congressional leaders prefer the establishment white male candidate to the progressive black woman running against him.

The present officeholder is very fine progressive, there is no need to reject him because he is a white male WAKE UP

Don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.  There is no current office holder:  Senator Barbara Milkuski retired.  The Dem primary has two competitors, both former Representatives:  a white male tied to the establishment and a black woman progressive who not infrequently challenges the establishment.  But my point was that as with Hillary over Sanders, black leadership is choosing the establishment and status quo.

KARIN  I am talking about the race for the senate in Maryland , Van Hollen is up against an African American female in  the primary,some are supporting her because she is female and black, that is their right, Van Hollen has very good record regarding the average citizen and deserves election

That&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about and he is not "the current office holder".  I like Chris Van Hollen and was sorry to see these two competing against each other, but the bottom line is that he has often gone along and/or promoted the neoliberal party line; she has not.

I believe, as an older black woman, that many people dismiss the fact that black legislators, despite being black, act and think just like their white counterparts. Black men perceive themselves as men first instead of the accepted paradigm of being black first!

Or maybe it&apos;s about the temptation of/maintaining one&apos;s money and power and status irrespective of race or gender.   There are maybe a dozen Senate contests in which a Dem centrist is competing with a progressive for the chance to run.  Without exception the Dem establishment is supporting, and often fighting for, the centrist.  Progressives are a threat to their established interests.

Starting to look like tea party problems with Republicans.

Which is really Sanders&apos; point:  the elite stick together to maintain their privilege, regardless of party, gender, race.

There&apos;s an interesting pattern in the primary results.  Clinton seems to be winning primaries but it&apos;s because she leads in the big cities of each state.  If you look at state maps in color that indicate who led in each individual county, it looks like somebody&apos;s lawn, aside from the big cities it&apos;s all green (if blue represents Clinton and green represents Sanders), meaning Sanders led in the suburban and rural counties.  I&apos;ve seen this in state after state, including New York.  The problem seems to be that all these votes  can&apos;t overcome the large populations in the big cities who vote for Clinton.  In other words, Sanders has  a larger base than is generally supposed, he is reaching voters who live in areas that have been the hardest hit by the recession.  I think these voters know he understands inequality at the gut level, he&apos;s not someone who only "seems to promise progress".

West Coast cities are different,

....been black for over 60 years...wouldn&apos;t vote for Clinton if they had my children hostage..than again...not from the south.

As a older African-American voter(69), and one who has been voting for presidents since 1968, I tire of the views about the monolithic African-American culture.  We do not believe the same things, many of us have no southern roots going back three generations and therefore do not respond in the same ways.  Some of us have been aware of the Goldwater Girl since the 60&apos;s.   To believe and then write about our overwhelming support of a woman who vigorously touted he husbands policies, which hurt thousands of our families is just mind-numbing.  To further believe that we have no logical true sense of history, including up to the present moment sells us short.  I for one, and everybody it seems in my family, will have a very hard time in voting for this woman should she get the nomination.  We have not and will not drink the proverbial Kool-Aid.

African Americans delivered Maryland to Clinton tonight.  75%+ in primary after primary seems pretty "monolithic" to me.  However, I wouldn&apos;t presume to understand the reasons.  Just trying to get past my disappointment.

Great commentary, as always, from Eric Foner.

I am an ardent Bernie Sanders supporter, and I have a completely unsubstantiated theory that makes sense to me. African-Americans have more than a century of experience with promises made by liberal white leaders that were never kept, to put it nicely.  So of course they will not rely on someone who is new to them and making promises.  Start with the promise of freedom at the end of slavery that quickly morphed into the quasi-slavery of sharecropping and the abominable Black Codes. Thousands of former slaves  received land grants from white officials, but under Andrew Johnson loyal black former Union soldiers were evicted from their land and the land given to the former slaveholders. 

Perhaps more important, Black Americans were betrayed by FDR, a progressive white president offering to reform income inequality. To court white southern votes in Congress, FDR agreed to exempt farmworkers and domestic servants from important New Deal programs, including minimum wage laws . Of course, "agricultural workers" and  "domestic workers" were code words for black workers.

The list of betrayals is long. In part because of  the news media&apos;s refusal to cover Bernie until March 2016, many southerners had barely heard of him when it was time to vote. And southern blacks had every reason to distrust the promise of  economic equality made by an unknown white man from a white state.

We know Bernie has a long history of support for the black community, and we know he is exceptionally trustworthy, but many people did not know that when it was time to vote. It is a tragedy for which I blame the mainstream media.

Interesting thought.  Thank you for this perspective.

Good post. Don&apos;t forget Marijuana was made illegal because it was identified as the drug of choice by Mexican laborers, and "Negroes" during Jim Crow era, another demonizing dog-whistle campaign, and reason to throw them in jail.  Bernie has expressed taking away this racist tool.  What has Clinton said? "I didn&apos;t inhale?"

I wish everyone would stop referring to Vermont as a &apos;white&apos; state! Until the people who write the stories of our times begin to address all people as simply people instead of defining people only by race, the clumsiness of reportage about different groups within our society will remain static and largely untrue.
One of Vermont&apos;s realities is poverty and poverty marks the people who have the burden of trying to survive. Many, many residents of Vermont work multiple jobs just to get by and it is this reality that marks Bernie Sander&apos;s campaign. All poor people suffer the same malignancies and to assume that poor and/or southern blacks  can only relate to Hillary Clinton is an insult.

When my wife and I lived there near Burlington, 1998-2002, workers care-pooled 60 miles every day each way, for a low wage Walmart job in Williston, where we worked.

Foner&apos;s reasons fall just short of Tom Hayden&apos;s recent conversion to the Clinton camp and fails to convince for the same reason: because African Americans are supporting Clinton, I should, too?  That makes no sense. Black support for Clinton is not nearly as deep or as wide as is supposed. If Sanders somehow pulls off the nomination, all those voters will be voting for the white guy from Vermont.

Peter White. So true. There is support from all groups for Bernie. The media, including the Nation, is dividing the community of voters as a way to win the nomination for Hillary. I have spoken with people of all ethnicities who support Bernie. And don&apos;t forget that AZ and IL had vote fraud problems. Of course NY.

I don&apos; think The Nation&apos;s support of either Sanders or Clinton is monolithic.

There&apos;s also Hillary&apos;s view that, because she wants to continue Barack Obama&apos;s work, we should support her. Frankly, I don&apos;t think she and Obama ever were on the same page. And, in Joe Biden&apos;s recent comments, you might infer that he would prefer Bernie.

Sorry, I mistakenly gave you a thumbs-down (and a thumbs up too - didn&apos;t know you can do that.)  After 7 years (tears, fears, etc.) my political instincts tell me that Hillary was made Secretary of State, because he wanted to solidify support for Democrats in the "Gender Wars" of politics, and among "Pro-choice" activist women&apos;s.  IMO, by making "gender" and "choice" issues "Front & Center" in the so14 midterm campaigns in 2014  , we lost Red State seats in the Senate.

In Newark, NJ,  I watched the African-Americans in that city, get elected, and get power  from the White Identity culture there in the 1960-1970&apos;s, after the Race Riots.  Politics, in Newark, was always fought out among Democrats (there were hardly ever any republicans running for office, since before I was a kid in the 1950s.) There were white and black divisions and many other ethnic-cultural divides.  The African-Americans, acquiring  City Hall, followed the same machine politics modus operandi and corruption as the White-Identity politicians.  I left in 1990, but it probably continued until Corey Booker, the reformer.  The word on the street during that era, among African-American, was a distinctly Machiavellian spirit of "you got to go where the power is."  I imagine this disposition is a cruel result what compromises Black Families and the African-American Human Spirit had to make, to survive during Jim Crow.  Unfortunately (or Fortunately?) this is something Clinton and Obama never experienced with their own child development, in their own sheltered lives.  That&apos;s why the "Medicaid Expansion" was traded off in the ACA, as "optional."

The Democratic Party has been slowly abandoning African-Americans.  For instance, as the writer, Eric Foner, reminds us, "...You have seen your governor (supposedly a forward-looking Republican) reject the expansion of Medicaid, which would enormously benefit low-income people of all races, but especially blacks...."  But where was the Democratic Party (and Obama, and Clinton) when this loophole was traded off ?  I am now reading "Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin," except for the Bible, it was the best-selling book of the 19th century, a book to which many attribute the inspiration for Northerners to fight in the Civil War.  Lincoln&apos;s  Republican Party was a newly formed protest party after the 1854 Dread Scott Supreme Court decision, the decision confirming that African-Americans were "property."  After the Civil War and about 20 years of "Reconstruction" era, the Republican Party abandoned the "free the slaves" cause and became the party of American Aristocracy and Big Business, for political expediency.  The Democratic Party is following the same pattern: After championing institutional civil and human rights for African-Americans in the 1960&apos;s, the Democratic party quietly abandoned that cause, moving towards a 21st century version of Corporate Aristocracy, and by the 1990&apos;s: (1)Black Family Fathers were devastated  by the Democratic Party&apos;s passive  support for extreme criminal punishment and increased incarceration, insidiously targeting African-Americans; (2) Black Family Mothers were devastated by the Democratic Party&apos;s passive support for "Welfare Reform" also dog-whistled at African-Americans.  They still support the Democratic Party,  because Republicans are worse. The Republicans mostly instigated the incarceration injustice and "welfare reform."  The Democratic Party Establishment mitigated these efforts, but ultimately, passively supported them, for political expediency. The Democrats are, “The Lesser of Two Evils.”  The only real future hope for African-Americans nowadays, is the rise of young, energetic, intelligent African-Americans, like Sandra Bland. However, the white-identity political racists, and white-identity law enforcement racists, both perceive people like Sandra Bland as a threat to their culture, but they still like “Uncle Toms” the good-natured survivors, who are not a threat.

I am white, therefore privileged in that I don&apos;t experience or need to give a thought to racism; I am a retired School Psychologist, therefore economically secure; I have a State retirement plan, therefore am not tied to Social Security; I have no children, so I have no worries about their survival on this planet we are destroying.  Yet for some reason I care deeply about all of those things and have been passionately involved in politics and supportive of our best (last?) hope for real change, Senator Sanders.

For my concern, I&apos;ve been said by the MSM, Hillary supporters, and Black Lives Matter to be an ignorant racist,  a sexist with a place in hell reserved for me, and a foolish idealist. 

The choice of a vast majority of black Americans to maintain the status quo and bring back their victimizers - the Clintons - frees me to stop caring about the disaster this country has become and fighting for change, and enjoy new challenges within my sphere of privilege.   Thank you.

I have long held a diminished sympathy for the plight of millions of white USA citizens who collude with establishment Republikkkans and actually elect them into office. They not only “enjoy” self-inflicted wounds; their choices rebound to my pain and detriment as well, because I am subject to the debased nature of the resulting government. At the moment, my newly discovered surprise and unfavorable reaction toward the Afro-embrace of neo-con policies and plutocratic servitude has diminished my empathy for the Afro condition in our USA to an as yet undetermined degree. I don&apos;t like feeling like this, but I&apos;ve never been a punk either. My friends, if they are real, have to act like they are my friends. HRC is NOT a friend of the 99%.

Well first of all, the primaries are not exactly democratic when 60% of them are not open to the 42% of registered voters who are not Democrats (or Republicans).  So if Hillary winds up winning the nomination, that doesn&apos;t mean she&apos;s the "people&apos;s choice".

But second, while we might be ready to resign ourselves to "stupid American voters deserve what they get", the same can&apos;t be said of the rest of the world&apos;s people, who don&apos;t get to vote in our elections and yet have our bombs and drones and coups and sanctions raining down on them with no end in sight.

I have been wondering about this. I have a sense that, no matter what Hillary Clinton may say on the campaign trail, as president, she would not lift a finger for African-Americans. I read a blog post by an African-American blogger who argued that African-American voters are inextricably wedded to the Democratic Party establishment, no matter who their candidate may be. Like a previous commenter, I believe that anti-Semitism is a factor. As a Jew, I personally have been the target of anti-Semitism by African-Americans.

I&apos;m deeply sorry for your experience of anti-semitism from the black folk you encountered. But, my goodness, the "anti-semitism" critique is too easy, isn&apos;t it? It doesn&apos;t require any actual political analysis and posits one&apos;s personal experience to explain a complicated set of political factors (and I note, by the way, you haven&apos;t offered the same critique to explain ALL THE OTHER Hilary voters -- white, Latino, Asian, etc.).

It seems to me that these kinds of critiques are what one offers when one lives a segregated life -- because if you didn&apos;t, you&apos;d also encounter black folk who are deeply offended by anti-semitism. Indeed, much of these "what are black people thinking???" comments overall reveal just how segregated are the lives of many Nation readers (beyond the one or two friends of color, of course).

Might such comments also reveal that Sanders&apos; strategy itself is segregated? By this I mean: who&apos;s doing precinct walking in those segregated African American communities?

That is unfortunate.  I was reared in Chicago and attended the University of Chicago, even the Lab School. Ergo, I had everyday interaction with Jewish people.  However, when I finally left home and practiced in my field of endeavor, I did run into people of my race who did not like Jews.  Some from the point of the Christianity their slave-masters so lovingly (not) gave them, but became generations deep by the end or slavery.  You might be right and that is so, so sad.  During the civil rights era, the people marching with us were Jewish people.  If anyone could identify with us, it was the Jew.  How utterly mindless, that African-Americans will not support Bernie Sanders becasue he is Jewish.  Gee, I always thought Christ was too.  Mindless.

ROXANNE   You arte exactly correct, Jesus Christ was Jewish his entire life, was never a Christian, it did not exist in his lifetime, many Christians and others think that Jesus started Christianity and became a Christian, not so Christianity started to evolve 25 to 30 years after Jesus&apos;s death, that is the historical record

Neither Bill, nor HRC is any LBJ. Bill Clinton turned his back on southern blacks, just as I suspect HRC will do. I applaud black people, and us whites too in protecting Obama&apos;s legacy. But, HRC isn&apos;t the standard bearer she would have you believe. I have little confidence that things will improve for minorities in this country if HRC is elected. And don&apos;t waste your time on any Republican candidate.

I am a 72-year-old woman.  I have this access to the internet only because my daughter got me an iPad a few years ago.  I suggest to you that all poor people vote less for Bernie because they have no access to the internet, and thus to the more adequate news available here.  (I already knew of him through the progressive press, but what poor folks of any color get The Nation or any such?)

I am 69, but probably not poor.  I have a PhD, so probably not under educated.  I&apos;ve had a computer since the early 80&apos;s, as well as my friends. My Mother who passed last year was almost 94, stopped using the internet when she was 91.  Most poor people have cell phones which do access the World Wide Web.  I am a Bernie Sanders voter.  This article speaks of a monolithic Black culture, which may only exist in the south and those northern enclaves which still have their roots in &apos;southern thinking&apos;.  Other than me, I know at least 7 family members who get The Nation.  Oops, that&apos;s all my family, including children and grandchildren.  No &apos;19 Kids and Counting&apos;. for us.  I don&apos;t think lack of the internet is why southern-oriented people of African descent are supporting that HRC.

I was hoping for  novel and thought provoking  insights rather than a mid form version of the familiar narrative. 

But maybe it&apos;s just as simple as  what he lays out-- Bernie is a relative radical (given the reactionary state of mainstream political discourse)  and a white guy from a very white state.  This combination just doesn&apos;t feel right to older black voters.  

I have three other unsubstantiated theories: 

1)   The African American electorate may skew even older and even more female than than the white electorate.   These are groups that always favor Clinton over Sanders relative to all other voting groups in a given state/ demographic.  Hence, what appears to be whopping African American support is in part bolstered by other underlying demographic factors. 

2) The African American electorate (especially its older and southern components) is perhaps, more socially conservative than the white Democratic electorate.  They may be turned off on a visceral level by Sanders long time support of gay rights, his call for marijuana legalization, his non-religiosity, and his alternative lifestyle in the 1960s and 1970s. 

3) Most controversially, perhaps there is some latent Antisemitism at play here.   Let&apos;s face it--Bernie exudes Brooklyn Jew of his era every time he opens his mouth.  There is some survey data out there that suggests that entrenched Antisemitism is much more common among African Americans (and Latinos, especially first generation Latinos) than among the white and Asian population.    I would guess that Anti Jewish sentiment among younger African Americans is much much lower--one factor among many that ma explains why Bernie has had a much easier time courting younger African Americans.  

In summary,  my sense is that most people (myself included)  latch onto a candidate for reasons that are at least as much visceral and emotional than they are rational.  

Personally I am drawn to Sanders, for example, far more than I am to Jill Stein (even though on paper, I probably agree slightly more with Stein&apos;s slightly more radical platform)  because among many factors, Sanders reminds me of my Dad when he opens in his mouth, and every time I walk from my house to the Brattleboro Food Co-op,  I see at least five slender stooped men in their seventies with frazzled white hair who could be Bernie.  In other words, as a secular Jew who lives in Vermont,   Bernie&apos;s  particular stamp of humanness is very familiar to me, and I imagine, quite foreign to many African American voters.

I think your points 2 and three probably have some merit.  I am holding on to hope for California.  As an African-American woman who is 69, who developed and was involved during the struggle of the civil-rights era, and remembering the convention in &apos;68, I have to vote for Bernie.  I do not know at this juncture what to do if HRC gets the call at the convention.  If I end up voting for her, it is a vote against the other candidate and definitely not a vote  &apos;for&apos; her.

Good God, now "anti-semitism" is being offered as a reason that African Americans are supporting Clinton?  Are you sure you&apos;re not really Uncle Leo?  
All these comments for the most part are doing is reinforcing the validity of Foner&apos;s argument.


No, African Americans aren&apos;t stupid, uninformed, or anti-semitic.  They just don&apos;t happen to agree that Bernie Sanders is more qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton.  Get over it.

You appear to have replied to a comment that I didn&apos;t write.  

I didn&apos;t write that African Americans en masse are antisemitic--only that there is survey data that suggests that that there is more entrenched antisemitism amongst African Americans and Latinos (especially first generation Latinos) than among the white and Asian population.   Do you find fault with this survey data?    Do you think it is unreasonable to ponder if it had a role at some level in many voters non- attraction to Bernie?  I don&apos;t see why?   I think it would be an interesting questions to research.  Maybe the hypothesis would be proved wrong.  But maybe not. 

In any event, my central thesis is that people (myself included) are drawn to (and repelled) to candidates for visceral and emotional reasons at least as much as they are for rational reasons.   Foner&apos;s thesis isn&apos;t all that different in some ways.

You also seem to have missed where I wrote 
"unsubstantiated theories"  and "most controversially, perhaps."  

Cut a Hebrew some slack bro.  We&apos;re here to discuss ideas, no?

Because the prophet is without honor among his own people, I will re-post the words of Martin Luther King yet another time.

 "Now this means that we are treading in difficult waters, because it really means that we are saying there is something wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America needs to move toward a democratic socialism." 

"The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism".  

"Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God&apos;s children." 

If there is any doubt with whom Dr. King would stand, and stand proudly, we are even more lost than we seem.

Oh, great. Scalia lives.

Why should African Americans support such a duplicitous person as Hillary more than any other voting group, especially the most egregious harm the Clinton&apos;s have wrought on Those people, the crime bill, welfare reform bill, deregulation of financial sector re the economic collapse harming these same communities, am 79 year old Progressive/ liberal and have never seen such a completely dishonest fraud as Hillary

So in a nutshell, the argument in the article on why African American&apos;s support Hillary over Sanders because they "know her", are afraid that Sander might lose and that Hillary is associated with Obama.  We already know that. Fear and lack of knowledge (due to media incompetence and manufacturing consent) are causing Americans to vote aginst their interests. So what else is new?

Well said.

Dr. Foner,
I took your class on the left in the US in the 19th and 20th c back in the late 80s and learned a great deal from you about the particular means by which numerous left-leaning movements have been crushed by machine politics in the US.  I found your earlier article endorsing Sen Sanders brave and honest.  I even enjoyed this article but for the lack of (as someone else commented) comparisons to earlier left/progressive movements in the US, and the coordinated opposition that they met from the nominal party of the Left.  I wish it had been longer.    
Your points are well taken, and points I&apos;ve heard from not particularly progressive, but Democratic whites in the US who just don&apos;t want things to get any worse than they are already, but I find this cohort to be not-particularly-progressive because they are very rich and white.  It&apos;s been true many times in the past that electorates do often settle for a status quo they find scarcely-bearable when thy are offered a future that promises them much more but (if the MSM is to be believed) will almost certainly crush what little life and dignity are left in them should they even partially succeed in making their wishes known.  They can rightly be afraid of this because the NYT tells them to be, and if the NYT and all its more overtly hostile cousins in the world of money and power tell them that things will get much worse for them if they pull some "please, sir, may I have some more" bullshit, then they do indeed have reason to be afraid.  I remember the long list of violent acts of suppression by the State and corporations in defense of money that was the theme of your course.

Knowing the breadth of your erudition on how the upper class (grown ever smaller and wealthier) have quite literally made a career and a religion out of crushing the bulk of the populace, I wish you had written at greater length on the subject IN THIS PARTICULAR RACE.  I know from your previous statements and this article that you support Sen Sanders for a lot of the same reasons that  Noam Chomsky, Cornell West, and others support him.  I would find your thoughts on how  the neoliberal Clintonians represent a very basic and complete reversal of the New Deal Democrats&apos; accomplishments that could never have been achieved by the Right, as the infliction of this level of degradation on a group of people is the very hallmark of a struggle en famille.

That&apos;s a long way of asking you to write an essay on what you&apos;ve observed on the new modes of suppressing left-wing populist movements that we&apos;ve seen in this election.  I would consider it a service that the Nation owes to its readers, and I know you&apos;ve done enough reading and writing and lecturing about the subject to show us how the DNC as well as the MSM plays to our fears by creating a "no-alternative-but-Hillary" false consciousness, to use a dated term.   Would you please share your thoughts on the sustained and violent attempts on the life of Leftist Populism in the US in the 2016 election and in the years leading up to it?
A grateful student,
Stephen Moran MD

I really don&apos;t see how "familiarity" and desire to protect Obama&apos;s legacy are rational reasons for favoring Hillary; "understandable" may be accurate but the African-American electorate may very well be on the way to sinking the first truly progressive candidate since LBJ.  I hope they will be happy with what they bargained for.

Andrew Carey--
"The first truly progressive candidate since LBJ"?  Really?  What about George McGovern in 1972, Jesse Jackson in 1984 & 88, and, if we go beyond the Dems, Ralph Nader in 2000?.  One doesn&apos;t have to denigrate LBJ&apos;s domestic (and only domestic) policies, or Bernie&apos;s current candidacy to acknowledge that there have been occasional progressive platforms put forward by others between 1964 and now.

With all due respect Mr. Foner, you start out by saying that you "cannot speak for black voters or for any individual’s choice of candidate" other than your own, but then you go on to make a simplistic and poorly substantiated case for why the majority of African American voters in South Carolina support Clinton. You narrow it down to: a preference for incremental progress, familiarity with Clinton, and extreme protectiveness of President Obama. You do not cite sources or interviews, but simply your sense of it. Then you repeat this infuriating MSM meme: "Sanders supporters too frequently fail to understand the conditions facing African Americans today." This is so unhelpful and unnecessary. Bernie&apos;s supporters are as varied as any group of millions of people. Sure Clinton has more support amongst African Americans, perhaps because voters have been told from the beginning, way before Sanders even had a chance to introduce himself to the electorate at large, that somehow he couldn&apos;t connect with black people. Well, if a trope is repeated often enough, it can become the truth. Bernie worked hard in the south to introduce himself, but it was late in the game and the mighty headwinds of the MSM were working 24/7 to dispense with him. As for Obama, to many of us it&apos;s obvious that Clinton uses him to pander to the African American community. She has disagreed with him on many issues, and one has only to watch some youtube videos from the 2007-8 presidential campaign to understand that she had very little respect for him back then, and attacked him with vigor and racist innuendo.

Clinton managed to wrap herself in Obama&apos;s clothes; as, until recently, an "outsider" and still not part of the party establishment, Sanders could not do so. The Clinton campaign exploited this very cleverly I think, but alas with not much to show for (the article above does not mention anything here), going by history rather the contrary, which is thoroughly tragic, as a real opportunity for major change may be lost for a foreseeable future (unless the Sanders people manage to reform the Party from within, starting at the Convention).

For me all of this is a perverse replay variant of the tragic tale of Tom Watson who, seeking to break the gridlock of the duopoly in the 1890s sought to unify black and white votes in the South (Georgia) but was ultimately crushed by the Establishment Duopoly through the manipulation of the black vote.  Eventually Watson DID come to power, but only once he renounced his commitment to unifying black and white and became a hard-core segregationist, arguing that progress could never be made until blacks were entirely disenfranchised.  The candidate who could potentially actually really do more to help poor blacks out of poverty is crushed by the manipulation of the black vote by the Establishment who will really do nothing but pander with identity-politics slogans.  And worse for those few members of the African-American community who support him, since they are seen as traitors, sell-outs, and oreos.

I am an older student, 63, at a local community college 
In DuPage Co. west of Chicago. I spoke with many students, black, white and Latino. All ethnic groups were representatives of Bernie For President Support.

I am not so sure Hillary and Pres. Obama got along all that well. There was a well understood split in his administration among the Hawks (Hillary, some generas and say Robt. Gates) with less hawkish (Obama and probably Joe Biden). The Hawks liked war and resisted diplomacy, while the less hawkish liked diplomacy and resisted war. The episodes in Lybia, Egypt and Syria didn&apos;t go well. She opposed the Iran treaty against Obama and Biden. I think that is why Biden has been hinting that maybe we need a president with broader ideas for change: hint, not Hillary.

Hillary Clinton put in place the sanctions that led to the Iran Deal. Please http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-helped-usher-iran-negotia/

I don&apos;t understand your statement that Clinton as SoS opposed the Iran treaty. She helped organized the sanctions that brought Iran to the table and made it happen. Libya and Egypt have not gone well, but nothing has gone well in that part of the world (with the exception of Tunisia, but that is another story). She did push Obama to support secular rebels against Assad at the time of the Arab Spring uprising, but he did not. There is no way to know if that would have helped or hurt. But I really get sick of the armchair quarterbacks who seem to think that a Secretary of State can make a region that is hopelessly chaotic into some sort of wonderland.

And has John Kerry, who has been in the job for awhile, done any better?

Please excuse my re-comment: that the church social set of the African American community has sold its soul and its vote all too cheaply to a couple that has wreaked considerable damage upon their community. Martin Luther King would be appalled at the ease with which Mr. Clinton seduced that community in the first place and the entitlement with which Mrs. Clinton enjoys its continued devotion.  All too often King&apos;s name is invoked as a benevolent saint from the distant past rather than as the democratic socialist he came to be in his later years. In 1966 King said this to his associates: "Now this means that we are treading in difficult waters, because it really means that we are saying there is something wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America needs to move toward a democratic socialism." That was in 1966, when income inequality in the nation was in no way comparable to the horrid inequality of the present day. This theme found even more explicit expression in "The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism".  And again, "Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God&apos;s children." King saw that the struggle must proceed on all fronts: against racism, of course, but also, and equally against militarism, and finally against the egregious income inequality engendered by capitalism. Were King still with us, there would be little doubt with which candidate he would ally himself. He would certainly not stand with the candidate who surrounds herself with Wall Street profiteers, war criminals, those who follow solely for the sake expected advancement, and those who confuse the most audacious influence peddling scheme in America&apos;s history for the Promised Land.

I have made some major mistakes in life - for all the right reasons.

How would you say the Bernie movement compares to the populist movements of the past?
