Susan Rice, the president’s national security adviser, spoke out Wednesday against those in American politics who have called for barring refugees based on their religion and said the United States needs a more diverse foreign policy workforce to address the national security challenges facing the country.

Rice, who previously served as President Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations, addressed the graduating class at Florida International University in Miami. Her remarks offered insight into the case the White House will make this fall against Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.

“To those who deride our diversity, my answer is:  I see why it matters every day, in those who protect this country and grapple with the toughest global issues we face,” said Rice, who didn’t mention Trump. The likely GOP nominee has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants to the United States.

Rice spoke briefly of the innovative spirit that immigrants bring. “We see it in America’s businesses, where many of our most successful companies were started or grown by immigrants — think Apple, created by Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant from Homs,” she said.

But much of her address focused on the need for a more diverse foreign policy workforce to defend and represent the country abroad. Minorities account for nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population but make up only 20 percent of the country’s senior diplomats, she said. Even in the military, which has long been praised for the diversity in its ranks, less than 15 percent of senior military and senior intelligence officers are minorities. Obama recently has spoken with concern about the lack of minorities among the top ranks in the military.

“The U.S. military, interestingly, has probably done as good of a job as any institution in our society when it comes to integration and bringing diverse people in, but, as you go up the ranks, you start seeing that it becomes less and less reflective of the broader population and the troops, the men and women in uniform who are coming in,” Obama said last month at a speech at the University of Chicago.

Obama’s remarks followed a meeting with his senior commanders in the White House, all of whom are white. “We had a really interesting conversation about what’s happening?” he said.  “How much of this is that the young African American or Latino officer, or woman officer isn’t mentored by the person right above them, and steered into particular assignments that are less likely to achieve a promotion?”

In her remarks, Rice said that a more diverse foreign policy workforce — one that is not “white, male and Yale” — is a national security priority. Native speakers often can pick up nuances or cultural clues that might go unnoticed by other diplomats, she said. A diverse foreign policy workforce also sends a powerful signal to the rest of the world.

“Think of the LGBT person in Bangladesh who knows that someone at the American embassy understands who she is,” Rice said.  “Think of the Iraqi soldier, learning to fight alongside Iraqis from other religious sects, who takes inspiration from America’s own multi-ethnic force.  Think of young Haitians drawn to converse with a Foreign Service officer who has dreadlocks like their own — or our ambassador to India, Richard Verma, showered with rose petals when he visits his grandmother’s ancestral home in Punjab.  That is how we build bridges and deepen partnerships in an increasingly globalized world.”
