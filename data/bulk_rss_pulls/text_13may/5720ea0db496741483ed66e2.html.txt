Americans share their hopes, fears and frustrations in interviews from the campaign trail.


Americans share their hopes, fears and frustrations in interviews from the campaign trail.

Mayor Shirley Franklin started a program in the city of Atlanta in which every single student who graduated from a public school, she’d find a way to pay for their first year of college. And, after hearing my story, she took an interest in me. She gave me a job in her office and she helped me get into college. Summer came, and I didn’t go to work because I didn’t have a suit. I got a call saying, “You need to get to work,” and she had someone take me suit shopping. They took me and bought me like five different suits and said, “This is how you invest in your kids.” I’m the first person in my family to graduate from college. That is the kind of local politics I grew to love in Atlanta. National politics is more messy. But I have hope that is going to change.

About this project

Both of my parents grew up in really poor, rural areas. They just wanted to get out of there, so they joined the military. Most of my family is in the military. A lot of my friends are in the military. I remember my senior year everyone graduating and being excited about college. But then when we graduated, the war in Iraq started. So instead of all of us walking together, some people were in Iraq, some people in Afghanistan. I think there are a lot of people like me who are in their mid-30s and who have that frame of mind. It’s just crazy to just say, “Yes, let’s bomb them. Let’s carpet bomb them. If kids get killed, oh well.”

About this project

I graduated in Chicago where, at that time, it had the highest unemployment rate. When I was applying for jobs, I was lucky to get one interview a month because so many dentists lost their offices or lost their jobs. There were over 100 applicants on each Craigslist job posting. And, I had just graduated and I was going up against people who had been dentists for 10 to 15 years. I had to actually work overseas for three years in Singapore. My student loans are still in default, but I’m working on them. That’s how much the 2008 economy hurt me. If Trump is president, I don’t see him bankrupting the country like George W. Bush did.

About this project

Out here in Vegas, it is hard to get good wages. It took me like six months to get a job here. And I had good experience. When I didn’t have a job, I was on unemployment, and I tried to get help; I wanted to be in the work force. And that’s why there’s so much alcoholism and drugs out here. They get depressed because they can’t find a job. And the candidates haven’t talked about it as much, probably because they’ve never faced it, or never paid attention to it. Or something that they want to keep under the rug.

About this project

I believe that from ages 18 to 22, the country and the corporate society have nowhere to put us. We’re not trained for anything. So college, I think, is a big business. They parked this whole generation of young people there for a while so they can be trainable. I don’t want them to go into debt. I paid for my college; my parents didn’t. I got out of school, and I was working for the New York State Department of Labor. And I had $50,000 worth of debt, and I had a $18,000-a-year job. So maybe college should be more affordable, or maybe free. But we do need to do something with our youth. They’re not ready for prime time.

About this project

My mom was 16 when she had me, so my dad wasn’t ever around. So there weren’t too many people to look up to, you know? Trump was just always out there. A lot of people never liked him, but he seems successful. I always wanted to be like a businessman, and I liked the way he did it. I saw Trump – I thought that’s somebody to look up to. Ain’t too many successful people in my neighborhood as far as business – maybe doing something illegal. But a legit businessman going all over the world, that has buildings? Where I’m from it’s good to have some Jordans, that might be the goal. But I don’t hear nobody talking about having buildings that they built.

About this project

My husband came to the United States when he was 16. He was up here working, sending money back. He’s got family members who have been here, some legally, some not. I’ve got six grandchildren who are half-Mexican. You do not call people rapists and murderers and drug dealers. One group of people. There are good and bad people in every country. It makes me mad, roaring mad. Even people who were born here like me, in America — we have criminals, we have rapists. My birthday is in August and so my son and my 18-year-old grandson took me to the state fair. They have something where you place a kernel of corn in a glass jar to say who you’re voting for. And my grandson started to go to drop his in Trump’s. And I hit him with my paper. I’m not telling him how to vote. But I kind of did.

About this project

As a small girl, we didn’t live too far from a railroad spur. And Wendell Willkie came into town, and I went out to see him.  And I said, “Oh mom, you have to vote for him, he’s cute!” And she says, “What did you do? Where did you go?” And I got the third degree. “Don’t you ever come into this house talking like that again!” So that’s how I got indoctrinated into what’s the good party and what’s not the good party. And then I married a rabid Democrat. I would say all my kids are Democrats. I like Hillary because I thought she should have got it eight years ago, when I busted my — I mean, when I caucused for her.

About this project

One of my biggest issues with the way a lot of entitlements are crafted, what they amount to are generational transfers to existing and future retirees. I think unless there’s some truly radical policy changes, I just don’t see the financial situation as sustainable. There are just a lot of generational and institutional pressures that are going to keep on keeping on regardless of who is in office. So for me personally, that’s why I like some of the more radical proposals for making the United States more competitive internationally. The time for incremental changes probably passed 30 years ago. We can’t just keep kicking the can down the road.

About this project

I never thought about senior citizens until I became one. We’re one of the only countries in the world that doesn’t respect seniors. Most seniors supported kids through school. Now that they’re old, some of them choose between paying for their house or paying for their prescriptions. Their golden years are not so golden. They work all their lives, then they retire and then they can’t live. I worked hard, I saved some money, I’m enjoying mine. I was a forklift driver. I got a pension from Firestone. But there’s hardly no such thing as a pension anymore.

About this project

I started paying attention to politics when I started having to pay taxes. I went to school and I worked and I paid for going to school, and it wasn’t easy. I look at other people and it just doesn’t seem like they were working as hard as I was. I bought a condo and down the street they got low-income housing. And they were living in nicer places than me. But I was paying full price for it, you know? The less you make, the more you get. Being in a union, everyone gets paid the same, no matter how hard you work. I don’t like it. I’m not a big union guy, but it’s the best-paying job around.

About this project

I have a 2-year-old daughter. Maybe I’ll be asking this question every time my daughter goes into a grade, or a different school: “How is she going to get out of the building when someone comes through that door?” It’s scary. And we’re becoming immune to that fear. When I was 16 or 17, I worked at a grocery store. Around 7:30 or 8 o’clock, it got quiet. It was just me and another girl, and she was busy. A man came up to the window and pointed a gun at me and said, “Give me the money in the register.” I just did what he wanted me to do. People face worse than that. But I’ll never forget that feeling. I’ll never forget looking down the barrel of a gun.

About this project

I came from Peru in 1963. I was legally given a visa. At the time when I came into this country, they didn’t give us money or anything like that. You came in. You put your money in the bank. And then you supported yourself. Nowadays, this country gives all the Muslims or whoever is coming, welfare, money, housing, furniture. I worked for the city of La Mesa in California and I used to deal with a lot of people from Afghanistan. They come into America and they give free rent, free food, free money and all of that. I worked all my life. I went to school. And, now, we have to work harder to support those people.

About this project

The black casino workers and hotel people, once they got off work, they were never allowed back into the hotels and casinos once they punched out. They couldn’t even go in there to have breakfast or have dinner at all back then. When the union first formed, my mother and my grandmother had us out on the picket line with them, so they could sit in the restaurant, or go to the shows. So that’s been with me all my life. You have a lot of different immigrants in Vegas now. And everybody is in the melting pot, and everyone’s got something to say. The union has given a voice to the voiceless for me. It has. Yes, it has.

About this project

I had experienced a sexual assault freshman year. I was, like, 14. My parents didn’t really believe me. No one in school really believed what happened. I realized at that moment that education was going to be my way out of that situation. Get into a good college and just get away. I realized that I wanted to help other people in ways that I hadn’t been helped. Politicians talk about it when it’s trending in the news. And then they move on. If you are really going to look at women being equal, you need to look at situations where they are unequal. They can’t be an equally successful parent if they are afraid of their partner. They can’t be effective at their job if they’re having PTSD. All of these boil down to an equal-rights issue.

About this project

I tutored a kid. This little black kid. He looked up to me a lot. One day he asked me, “Mr. Ebbie, is jail a good place to be?” I said, “Why would you ever ask that?” He said: “My daddy’s in jail and he said he gets three meals a day. And sometimes my mom can’t make me food and I’m hungry.” I went home and I cried that night. This is a kindergartner. Teachers told him he was going to jail. I looked at him as a 5-year-old. I didn’t see a criminal. I didn’t see a drug dealer. I didn’t see a rapist. I didn’t see a gangbanger. I saw myself, when I was a little kid 10 years ago. The candidates, a lot of them, are from very privileged backgrounds and benefit from a white, male, Christian power structure. And that’s O.K. I don’t think that white people should feel guilty about their privilege. But they should feel a responsibility to acknowledge it.

About this project

I’ve been in it for years. I was asked to make telephone calls. I worked at the polls. I had my picture taken with Mrs. Nixon, Mrs. Eisenhower. When Reagan came to Portsmouth, I set up a room for him and his wife. I’m in the book “Who’s Who in American Politics.” You can find me in there if you’ve got that book. I think it’s important to take part. Get involved. Do what you can. We started out with taking fliers to people’s houses and telephoning. There’s so much to do. I wish I was more able. I haven’t been doing anything too much in the last few years. Being 94 now, I kind of let other people do it. But I do still vote. And I still have signs in my window.

About this project

I came out at 15. I had gotten rid of all the kind of people who would go against me before I came out, and was discovering a lot about my gender identity. I stopped going to church, and all that sort of stuff. But luckily my family is really accepting. They can’t be perfect. It’s more of a learning experience for them, just as much as it is for me. Luckily they have a very outspoken son. But I live in rural Iowa. Going out canvassing in a lot of these rural areas when I’m sort of expressing my gender more femininely is not necessarily the safest thing. I did go out with painted nails and skinny jeans and a cardigan and I got yelled at on the side of the street. Around the college is completely fine. But outside of that, it’s not as safe.

About this project

I had just gotten my family out in the beginning of September, out of Aleppo. I have three family members remaining there: my uncle, his little baby and his wife. The baby was born prematurely because a bomb fell on their home. The next leader of the U.S. has to know that this is an important issue for me. How did the U.S. start? It was people from all over Europe, coming here, looking for freedom. My daughter, she’s 5. We’ve been talking about refugees and freedom so much, she wants to be the Statue of Liberty for Halloween. We talk about the poem inscribed on her tablet. She says, “Make sure you give me something like that: Give me your poor, your hungry.”
