 (CNN)On Tuesday, voters will go to the polls in West Virginia. All signs indicate that Hillary Clinton is doomed there. Even if she wins the primary, she has sufficiently angered voters with her comments on coal. "We are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business," she said at a March CNN town hall, almost sounding like she was going to close the mines down herself.  At her appearance on May 2, protesters drowned her out with signs that read, "I am proud to be a coal miner's daughter" amid a sea of Trump banners.  At his rally, supporters waved "Trump Digs Coal" posters.
