We voted and supported obama, numerous donations etc, betrayal is a hard word to use, health reform to occur in public i.e. csapn etc. all behind closed doors, no public option, no competitive bidding on medicare drug prices, made an agreement/ deal with rep. Tauzin representing big pharma no bidding, lost savings of hundreds of billions of dollars\s, BTW pharma spends 17 percent of funds on research, the rest profits and promotion, a complete disgrace, Hillary will be the same

Obama was a huge disappointment. But as someone noted, he was ALWAYS a neoliberal / Clintonite. Always. I&apos;m glad he got elected and worked hard for that to happen. But that was the end. I won&apos;t support another neoliberal again.
