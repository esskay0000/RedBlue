Republican presidential candidate John Kasich's hopes for a strong showing in Massachusetts were dashed by rival Donald Trump, who  coasted to easy victory Tuesday. 

Minutes after polls closed in Massachusetts, the Associated Press called the state for Trump. The state's moderate Republicans were considered one of Kasich's best shots for good news on Super Tuesday. Former Gov. William Weld had endorsed Kasich, as had The Boston Globe.

Exit polls showed a majority of Massachusetts Republican voters wanted a political outsider. About half the voters in the Republican primary were independents - a record this year, ABC News reported. And about half of these independents went for Trump.

Massachusetts is packed with the independent, blue-collar voters who will decide key general election states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. If Trump trounces his Republicans rivals by pulling in those voters in Massachusetts, Democrats are afraid he could do the same to them nationwide in November.

The state's 42 delegates are awarded proportionally according to a candidate's statewide tally and it is the largest non-Southern prize for Republicans.
