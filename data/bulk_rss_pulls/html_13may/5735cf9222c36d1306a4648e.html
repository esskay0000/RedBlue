			<div class="article-content">
				<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-4328169"></div></div><br />

<p>Steve Hill in many ways is a typical candidate running for elected office in California. He&#8217;s a former U.S. Marine looking to reform public schools, reduce the state&rsquo;s mass incarceration rates, and create jobs. But a couple things are holding him back: He&rsquo;s an avowed atheist and <a href="http://nation.time.com/2014/01/07/satanists-unveil-statue-for-oklahoma-capitol/?iid=sr-link5">Satanic Temple</a> organizer.</p>
<p>Hill is a Democrat running for the state Senate in California&rsquo;s 21st district, and probably the only candidate in the country who embraces both atheism and the tenets of modern-day Satanism. But Hill, who ran unsuccessfully as a write-in candidate last year during a special election, said this year he&rsquo;s getting shunned by the Democratic establishment largely because of views the party believes are too extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://time.com/3973573/satanism-american-history/">Satanist</a> as far as trying to get people to understand that I don&rsquo;t believe in the devil any more than I believe in God,&rdquo; Hill said in an interview. &ldquo;All of it is stupid. But if I have to tell people I&rsquo;m the devil to get them to listen, then, OK, I&rsquo;m the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/3973573/satanism-american-history/?iid=sr-link1"><strong>Read more:</strong> The Evolution of Modern Satanism in the U.S.</a></p>
<p>Hill, who also works as a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, is currently helping organize an L.A. chapter for <a href="http://time.com/3973573/satanism-american-history/?iid=sr-link6">the Satanic Temple</a>, a nationwide Satanic activist organization. Hill said he identifies with the temple&rsquo;s mission, which he described as a &ldquo;humanist approach that raises levels of consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go worship Satan and pour milk on me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But [Satanism] would influence me greatly because I could deal from a different perspective, as a regular human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last few years the Satanic Temple has tried to push Satanism away from its perception of devil worship and into politics. The group says its mission is to &ldquo;encourage benevolence and empathy&rdquo; in society while using Satanic imagery to further its goals. Hill says he reconciles his atheism with Satanism by not believing in any sort of deity or otherworldly presence and instead adheres to the Satanic Temple&#8217;s goals like keeping church and state separate.</p>
<p>The group has often challenged organizations like <a href="http://time.com/32358/westboro-church-fred-phelps-dead/?iid=sr-link6">the Westboro Baptist Church</a>, which regularly holds anti-gay protests at military funerals and has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Satanic Temple also pledged to erect <a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/12/10/the-new-satanism-less-lucifer-more-politics/?iid=sr-link1">a Satanic monument</a> on the grounds of the Oklahoma State Capitol alongside one displaying the Ten Commandments. (The Ten Commandments monument has since been removed.)</p>

<p>Doug Mesner, a Satanic Temple leader and spokesman who also often goes by the name Lucien Greaves, said he doesn&rsquo;t know of any members who are elected officials in the U.S., but added that &ldquo;every day, we&rsquo;re being told of new plans for credible people within our membership to make a run for various public offices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill hopes to be the first, running to replace Sharon Runner, the Republican incumbent who is not seeking reelection. But Hill acknowledged the difficulties. As of Thursday, he said he had roughly $100 in his campaign account and that he&rsquo;s essentially been abandoned by the Democratic Party and plans to file as an independent. He&rsquo;s also running in what he calls the &ldquo;most religious area of Los Angeles County,&rdquo; an area just north of the city. And it&rsquo;s not just the party that&rsquo;s left him behind. He said many of his friends have kept their distance since it&rsquo;s come out that he&rsquo;s an open atheist running for office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think more people are climbing out from under these rocks and saying, we exist,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re human.&rdquo;</p>

He&#8217;s a former U.S. Marine looking to reform public schools, reduce the state&rsquo;s mass incarceration rates, and create jobs. But a couple things are holding him back: He&rsquo;s an avowed atheist and <a href=\"http:\/\/nation.time.com\/2014\/01\/07\/satanists-unveil-statue-for-oklahoma-capitol\/?iid=sr-link5\">Satanic Temple<\/a> organizer.<\/p>\n<p>Hill is a Democrat running for the state Senate in California&rsquo;s 21st district, and probably the only candidate in the country who embraces both atheism and the tenets of modern-day Satanism. But Hill, who ran unsuccessfully as a write-in candidate last year during a special election, said this year he&rsquo;s getting shunned by the Democratic establishment largely because of views the party believes are too extreme.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3973573\/satanism-american-history\/\">Satanist<\/a> as far as trying to get people to understand that I don&rsquo;t believe in the devil any more than I believe in God,&rdquo; Hill said in an interview. &ldquo;All of it is stupid. But if I have to tell people I&rsquo;m the devil to get them to listen, then, OK, I&rsquo;m the devil.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3973573\/satanism-american-history\/?iid=sr-link1\"><strong>Read more:<\/strong> The Evolution of Modern Satanism in the U.S.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Hill, who also works as a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, is currently helping organize an L.A. chapter for <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3973573\/satanism-american-history\/?iid=sr-link6\">the Satanic Temple<\/a>, a nationwide Satanic activist organization. Hill said he identifies with the temple&rsquo;s mission, which he described as a &ldquo;humanist approach that raises levels of consciousness.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go worship Satan and pour milk on me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But [Satanism] would influence me greatly because I could deal from a different perspective, as a regular human being.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In the last few years the Satanic Temple has tried to push Satanism away from its perception of devil worship and into politics. The group says its mission is to &ldquo;encourage benevolence and empathy&rdquo; in society while using Satanic imagery to further its goals. Hill says he reconciles his atheism with Satanism by not believing in any sort of deity or otherworldly presence and instead adheres to the Satanic Temple&#8217;s goals like keeping church and state separate.<\/p>\n<p>The group has often challenged organizations like <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/32358\/westboro-church-fred-phelps-dead\/?iid=sr-link6\">the Westboro Baptist Church<\/a>, which regularly holds anti-gay protests at military funerals and has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Satanic Temple also pledged to erect <a href=\"http:\/\/nation.time.com\/2013\/12\/10\/the-new-satanism-less-lucifer-more-politics\/?iid=sr-link1\">a Satanic monument<\/a> on the grounds of the Oklahoma State Capitol alongside one displaying the Ten Commandments.

But Hill acknowledged the difficulties. As of Thursday, he said he had roughly $100 in his campaign account and that he&rsquo;s essentially been abandoned by the Democratic Party and plans to file as an independent. He&rsquo;s also running in what he calls the &ldquo;most religious area of Los Angeles County,&rdquo; an area just north of the city. And it&rsquo;s not just the party that&rsquo;s left him behind. He said many of his friends have kept their distance since it&rsquo;s come out that he&rsquo;s an open atheist running for office.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;But I think more people are climbing out from under

He&#8217;s a former U.S. Marine looking to reform public schools, reduce the state&rsquo;s mass incarceration rates, and create jobs. But a couple things are holding him back: He&rsquo;s an avowed atheist and <a href=\"http:\/\/nation.time.com\/2014\/01\/07\/satanists-unveil-statue-for-oklahoma-capitol\/?iid=sr-link5\">Satanic Temple<\/a> organizer.<\/p>\n<p>Hill is a Democrat running for the state Senate in California&rsquo;s 21st district, and probably the only candidate in the country who embraces both atheism and the tenets of modern-day Satanism. But Hill, who ran unsuccessfully as a write-in candidate last year during a special election, said this year he&rsquo;s getting shunned by the Democratic establishment largely because of views the party believes are too extreme.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3973573\/satanism-american-history\/\">Satanist<\/a> as far as trying to get people to understand that I don&rsquo;t believe in the devil any more than I believe in God,&rdquo; Hill said in an interview. &ldquo;All of it is stupid. But if I have to tell people I&rsquo;m the devil to get them to listen, then, OK, I&rsquo;m the devil.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3973573\/satanism-american-history\/?iid=sr-link1\"><strong>Read more:<\/strong> The Evolution of Modern Satanism in the U.S.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Hill, who also works as a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, is currently helping organize an L.A. chapter for <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3973573\/satanism-american-history\/?iid=sr-link6\">the Satanic Temple<\/a>, a nationwide Satanic activist organization. Hill said he identifies with the temple&rsquo;s mission, which he described as a &ldquo;humanist approach that raises levels of consciousness.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go worship Satan and pour milk on me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But [Satanism] would influence me greatly because I could deal from a different perspective, as a regular human being.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In the last few years the Satanic Temple has tried to push Satanism away from its perception of devil worship and into politics. The group says its mission is to &ldquo;encourage benevolence and empathy&rdquo; in society while using Satanic imagery to further its goals. Hill says he reconciles his atheism with Satanism by not believing in any sort of deity or otherworldly presence and instead adheres to the Satanic Temple&#8217;s goals like keeping church and state separate.<\/p>\n<p>The group has often challenged organizations like <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/32358\/westboro-church-fred-phelps-dead\/?iid=sr-link6\">the Westboro Baptist Church<\/a>, which regularly holds anti-gay protests at military funerals and has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Satanic Temple also pledged to erect <a href=\"http:\/\/nation.time.com\/2013\/12\/10\/the-new-satanism-less-lucifer-more-politics\/?iid=sr-link1\">a Satanic monument<\/a> on the grounds of the Oklahoma State Capitol alongside one displaying the Ten Commandments.

But Hill acknowledged the difficulties. As of Thursday, he said he had roughly $100 in his campaign account and that he&rsquo;s essentially been abandoned by the Democratic Party and plans to file as an independent. He&rsquo;s also running in what he calls the &ldquo;most religious area of Los Angeles County,&rdquo; an area just north of the city. And it&rsquo;s not just the party that&rsquo;s left him behind. He said many of his friends have kept their distance since it&rsquo;s come out that he&rsquo;s an open atheist running for office.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;But I think more people are climbing out from under

She had lost Indiana to Bernie Sanders, a small embarrassment in a year of galling humiliations. Indiana was a stubborn reminder of her weaknesses after a series of powerful victories in the Northeast&#8211;the sort of victories that Bill Clinton never won in 1992 until the general election. By contrast, his New York primary victory in &#8217;92 over Jerry Brown was Pyrrhic, even though it pretty much clinched the nomination for him; he was battered by the tabloids, he seemed exhausted, his unfavorables were stratospheric.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>He had larger problems than an email server: he had recently been found out as a Vietnam draft dodger and a womanizer. People called him Slick Willie. Within weeks, he would be in a deeper, darker hole than Hillary has experienced this year&#8211;he would be running third, behind George H.W. Bush and the independent Ross Perot. By June, only 13% of the public thought him trustworthy. He was toast.<\/p>\n<p>This is old news, but it&#8217;s living history for the Clintons. It is what keeps Hillary buoyant, even as the most glamorous Democratic constituencies&#8211;celebrities, idealistic college kids&#8211;have flocked to Bernie Sanders. More than any other politicians I&#8217;ve covered, the Clintons have a perfect sense of chronology. They know that politics moves more slowly than the daily media frenzy, that new story lines&#8211;comebacks, especially&#8211;are catnip to cable networks. They know that polls can change, that Trump will have his day, that the general election will be Armageddon. But they are confident she&#8217;ll win.<\/p>\n<p>Bill Clinton had help in his 1992 comeback. Perot proved to be something of a loony: he dropped out of the race in July and then dropped back in for the debates that fall. Bush was uninspiring throughout. But Clinton also made his own luck. His choice of Al Gore as Vice President was unconventional: Gore seemed a Clinton clone, young and moderate and Southern, rather than the usual ticket balancer&#8211;and his campaign team&#8217;s sense of tactics was refreshing. When Clinton and Gore took off on a celebratory bus tour through America right after the Democratic convention, the election was all but over. (Clinton&#8217;s domination in the fall debates sealed the deal.)<\/p>\n<p><span><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3817687\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In some ways, Hillary faces an easier task. Donald Trump is an implausible President of the United States. But she has a problem that Bill never had. He swept to the presidency on a wave of pure energy and enthusiasm&#8211;this was something new, the baby boomers were taking over! Hillary is the George H.W. Bush of this campaign, selling stability&#8211;which may prove to be a marketable asset, given the craziness on the Republican side&#8211;but momentum feeds on excitement. Core polling perceptions like &#8220;trustworthiness&#8221; can turn, but they need some impetus.<\/p>\n<p>Her vice-presidential choice will be important. A traditional pick would be someone young and Latino and male, but Hillary&#8217;s equivalent of an Al Gore would be &#8230; Elizabeth Warren. Another woman, but an outsider; a candidate who could rally Bernie&#8217;s legions of new voters, and who would be an excellent attack dog (a crucial vice-presidential function). I know, I know: the Clinton camp mistrusts Warren. She&#8217;d be a loose cannon, a risk. Her presence on the ticket might limit Hillary&#8217;s attempts to woo moderate Republicans and foreign policy hawks, which raises another possibility: Why not pick a moderate Republican woman&#8211;Condoleezza Rice, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley&#8211;to stem the barbarian tide? That would be unthinkably new.<\/p>\n<p>Inevitably, the vice-presidential selection will take a backseat in the general election. The presidency is won in discrete moments, as the public gauges the humanity of the candidates. Donald Trump is more a brand than a person; given the spray tan and egregious comb-over, he looks more like a panjandrum in The Hunger Games than a regular guy. How many spontaneous, empathetic human interactions has he had with individual voters? None that I can remember. He is all facade.<\/p>\n<p>There is a basic rule of politics in the television age: warm always beats cold (with the exception of Richard Nixon). Hillary Clinton&#8217;s ultimate trump card will be not her gender but her relative humanity&#8211;an ironic twist given her public awkwardness. Her decision to sit down with West Virginia coal miners and apologize for her harsh, but realistic, prediction that they&#8217;ll be losing their jobs is the sort of thing that would be unimaginable for Trump. In the amped intimacy of a presidential campaign, such moments matter.<\/p>\n<br><em>This appears in the May 16, 2016 issue of TIME.<\/em>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

straight toward a group of pro-Trump protesters on Monday in Marion, Ind., and made a last attempt to win them over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&ldquo;I have spent 20 years fighting to defend the Second Amendment,&rdquo; Cruz said on a street curb outside his rally, &ldquo;while Donald Trump is a New York liberal who will take away your Second Amendment rights.

Despite his best attempts to parry accusations from Trump about his citizenship and his honesty, Cruz is as far from winning the nomination as ever. He has just 565 delegates to Trump&#8217;s 996, according to the Associated Press count. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cruz has made Indiana and its 57 delegates something of a last stand: the state&#8217;s large population of evangelicals and Christian conservatives should have made it a comeback state for Cruz after a series of bad losses in the Northeast. The Tea Party wave of 2010 and afterward helped usher in seven of the eight members in the state&#8217;s Republican delegation.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This entire political process has conspired to put the state of Indiana in the position to stand up and speak the voice of sanity,&rdquo; Cruz said on Sunday. &ldquo;It is a fundamental choice: Do we get behind a campaign that is based on yelling and screaming and cursing and insults, or do we unify behind a positive, optimistic, forward-looking, conservative campaign based on real solution to the problems we are facing?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">And yet, Cruz lags behind Trump in Indiana by double digits in some polls, including one released Sunday by NBC News\/<em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>\/Marist that showed Trump with 49% of the vote to Cruz&rsquo;s 34% &mdash; a 15-point margin. He appears likely to lose tomorrow&#8217;s primary, and with it, much of the remaining faith in his party that he has a viable chance of stopping Trump.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic side, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are in a closer contest, though Clinton is slightly outpacing her opponent. The NBC\/<em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>\/Marist poll found Clinton ahead by 4 points, 50% to 46%. But with Clinton far outstripping Sanders in the overall delegate count, it is unlikely a victory by the Vermont Senator in Indiana would <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4310640\/bernie-sanders-convention-democratic-platform-policy-agenda\/?iid=sr-link1\">sway the race<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Indiana is an open primary, which means that Independents can vote in either primary. That benefits both Trump and Sanders, who draw on voters outside of the traditional base of their respective parties.<\/p>\n<p>Cruz has tried every tactic in the rulebook to save his candidacy, and even invented some of his own. He formed an agreement with Ohio Governor John Kasich, who did not compete in Indiana in order to give Cruz a clear shot.<\/p>\n<p>He made the remarkable move of choosing Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, as his running mate &mdash; although the Republican convention is still months away &mdash; in an effort to galvanize GOP support. And he has campaigned constantly in Indiana over the past week to boost his chances against Trump.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The state&#8217;s governor, Mike Pence, has endorsed Cruz. But even Trump seemed to win that argument.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> &#8220;I particularly want to commend Donald Trump,&#8221; Pence said last week, who &#8220;<\/span>has taken a strong stand for Hoosier jobs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8220;What he said about me was nicer than what he said about Cruz,&rdquo; Trump observed cheekily. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Indiana will be less important of a turning point for the Democrats. The outcome will either cement Clinton&#8217;s more than 300 delegate lead over Sanders, or give the Vermont Senator a momentary spark of energy as his campaign slows into the convention. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sanders has said he still is running to win the nomination, and believes he can sway superdelegates to <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4310640\/bernie-sanders-convention-democratic-platform-policy-agenda\/?iid=sr-link1\">support his candidacy at the Democratic convention if he can prove he is more likely to win in a general election<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton &#8220;will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia,&#8221; Sanders said at a press conference on Sunday. &#8220;In other words, it will be a contested convention.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In what was perhaps a sign of the shifting winds in the Democratic race, Clinton for the first time in April <a href=\"https:\/\/next.ft.com\/content\/209172ea-1080-11e6-bb40-c30e3bfcf63b\">raised more<\/a> than Sanders did, bringing in $26.4 million to Sanders&#8217; $25.8 million. Sanders&rsquo; fundraising was down some 40% compared with March. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sanders spend all of Monday campaigning in Indiana, holding three events across the state. Meanwhile, Clinton was making a swing through Appalachian coal country, in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>It marked Clinton&#8217;s first recent visit to Ohio as she prepares for a general election.<\/p>\n<p>Expecting a victory against Cruz tomorrow, Trump would like to do the same.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&ldquo;I would like to get on to Hillary,&rdquo; Trump told reporters on Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

They connected on the phone. &#8220;I just told him I thought that we needed him,&#8221; says Knight. &#8220;That right now, in this moment in time, he was the man who should be in charge. He should be the guy that can get us back to where we want to be.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to Knight, Trump responded: &#8220;Coach, I know exactly how I want you involved. And when the time comes, I will give you a call and we&#8217;ll go from there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And so early one recent morning in advance of the pivotal Indiana primary that may determine whether Trump can secure enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, the candidate called the coach. Many people still revere Knight in the state in which he won three national championships as coach of the Indiana University Hoosiers, despite being fired from the school in 2000 for <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.sun-sentinel.com\/2000-09-11\/sports\/0009110156_1_coach-knight-guidelines-spirit\">&#8220;uncivil, defiant and unacceptable&#8221; <\/a>behavior. So while Ted Cruz awkwardly called a hoop a &#8220;basketball ring&#8221; at an Indiana gym where the classic movie Hoosiers was filmed&ndash;&ndash;blasphemy in the hoops-obsessed state&ndash;&ndash;Trump wrangled a rock-star surrogate. They&#8217;ve appeared at campaign events together over the last few days, Knight&#8217;s white mane fixed on the cable news loop. &#8220;That son of a b-tch can play for me!&#8221; Knight said at one rally.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with TIME, Knight talked about the endorsement, why he believes Trump is the most honest candidate and whether he agrees with Trump&#8217;s proposal to build a wall along the border with Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>Knight has been interested in politics since he was a history and government major at The Ohio State University in the 1960s. &#8220;Over the years, I&#8217;ve made a little hobby of studying what&#8217;s going on, where we are and what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; Knight, who&#8217;s 75 and retired from both coaching and broadcasting, tells TIME. And he says he hasn&#8217;t come across anyone else like Trump. &#8220;Who reminds you of the best home run hitter?&#8221; Knight says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he reminds me of anybody. He&#8217;s Donald Trump.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re kindred spirits, accomplished alpha men accustomed to controversy. Knight&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_jc2ESr43PY\">thrown a chair,<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fm3YFFjj5y8\">choked a player<\/a>, and made an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1988\/04\/27\/sports\/knight-is-criticized-over-rape-remark.html\">infamous remark<\/a> about women: back in 1988, when asked by NBC news correspondent Connie Chung how he handled stress, Knight said &#8220;I think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.&#8221; Trump has made several well-publicized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1Y9_LJj7A68\">degrading remarks <\/a>about women, and a recent line that Hillary Clinton wouldn&#8217;t receive even 5% of the vote if she were a man, appeared to make Mary Pat Christie, the wife of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.com\/politics\/index.ssf\/2016\/04\/did_mary_pat_christie_roll_her_eyes_at_donald_trum.html\">visibly uncomfortable<\/a> while she stood behind Trump&#8217;s podium.<\/p>\n<p>Both have also made a habit of defying critics. Knight<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gS20_JesSq4\"> told the crowd<\/a> at Indiana&#8217;s Assembly Hall before a game that &#8220;when my time on earth is gone, and my activities are passed, I want [them to] bury me upside down, and my critics can kiss my ass.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Knight points to Trump&#8217;s business success, including developing &#8220;The Apprentice&#8221; into one of the most popular shows on TV, as a key reason for endorsing him. &#8220;You think of the things that are necessary for getting something back together and going in the right direction, you tell me who&#8217;s better to do it than he is?&#8221; Knight says. &#8220;This guy has a better background perhaps than anybody that has ever been a first-time entrant to the White House.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Asked how he squares that explanation with the multiple bankruptcies of Trump businesses, Knight leans on a sports metaphor. &#8220;Everybody has failure,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t play very well last night, I&#8217;ve got to figure out in our next game we&#8217;ve got to play better. We had trouble with the zone defense, I&#8217;ve got to figure out a better way to approach the zone. And we&#8217;re able to do things that way. I think we were able to look at things that were wrong with the way we were playing, and then we got those things going in the right direction. All you&#8217;ve got to do is check the number of times the kids that I coached won.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same thing with what he does. He looks at things, and everything isn&#8217;t going to go right. But he&#8217;s pretty good at looking at things and deciding what has to be done, and then getting it done. And you give me a person that&#8217;s as good as he is, that has that experience that he&#8217;s had, and has been able to get things on the right track, you find that guy, then I&#8217;ll talk to you about it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What about the experience of that woman, Hillary Clinton, who&#8217;s been a senator and Secretary of State? &#8220;I don&#8217;t get into all that stuff,&#8221; Knight says. &#8220;I&#8217;m just talking about the guy that I think is the best person that we have to get all that done. Let him figure on the Secretary of State. Let him do those things.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Knight, who coached Army from 1965-1971, Indiana from 1971 to 2000, and Texas Tech from 2001-2008, has no party affiliation. And while he donated $2,000 to &#8220;Texans for Rick Perry&#8221; in 2010, $2,000 to President George W. Bush in 2003, and golfed with Vice President George Bush (and country music star Charley Pride) after Indiana won its second national title under Knight in 1981, he says he also admired Birch Bayh, the three-term Democratic senator from Indiana, and Lee Hamilton, the Democrat who represented Bloomington, home of Indiana University, from 1965 through 1999. Knight insists party matters less than the person. &#8220;What the hell is a Republican?&#8221; Knight says. &#8220;What the hell is a Democrat? I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ve always urged people to make sure you vote for the right guy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Knight says he doesn&#8217;t support every Trump campaign plank. Of the proposal to erect a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to curb illegal immigration, Knight says &#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything to do with that.&#8221; Instead, he offers his own approach. &#8220;I think a great idea would be involving our various military services along the border all the way from San Diego to Houston. We&#8217;ve got military bases all over the country. We can just move some people down there and let those cartels who are doing a lot of hurt the youth of America, let those cartels fight against the Marine Corps.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Knight says he&#8217;s discussed this alternative to the wall with Trump. &#8220;I think that whatever he would chose to do, however he would go about it, I think that we need to get out of the hands of young American people that crap that comes across the border,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>In a speech Wednesday, Knight said there has &#8220;never been a more honest politician than Donald Trump.&#8221; Throughout the campaign, however, professional fact checkers have had a field day singling out Trump&#8217;s false statements. Politifact<a href=\"http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/personalities\/donald-trump\/statements\/byruling\/false\/\"> has posted<\/a> a running tally, now at 57, of Trump&#8217;s inaccuracies: after Trump&#8217;s sweep of five primary states on Tuesday and speech on foreign policy on Wednesday, the Washington Post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/fact-checker\/wp\/2016\/04\/28\/recidivism-watch-trumps-eight-repeated-falsehoods-in-16-hours\/\">found<\/a> Trump uttered eight falsehoods in sixteen hours. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about that,&#8221; says Knight. &#8220;As I look at him, I just say that what he&#8217;s done, he&#8217;s worked hard at it. He&#8217;s worked hard to do what he has accomplished. I think that &#8212; I don&#8217;t remember if I said whether he was the most honest guy or not, I don&#8217;t think I said that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"10\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4871891317001-10\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1QFdVSz\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4871891317001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><div class=\"clearvideofloat\"><\/div>\n<p>He <a href=\"http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/2016-presidential-race\/2016\/04\/27\/bobby-knight-endorses-donald-trump-never-honest-politician\/\">did<\/a>. &#8220;Well, I think that may be, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says Knight. &#8220;I think the guy has done a great job. I don&#8217;t think that political history is full of whole lot of tremendously honest people. I have never found any fault about that as far as Mr. Trump is concerned in my relationship with him.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I ask Knight if he sees similarities between Trump and himself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s even important,&#8221; Knight responds. &#8220;You ask 50 people about that question, they&#8217;re all going to have a different answer. I think that doesn&#8217;t mean anything.&#8221; Does he agree with Trump&#8217;s controversial remarks about women and Mexicans? &#8220;I don&#8217;t get into that,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s what he does. And what he thinks he should do. That&#8217;s up to him. It&#8217;s not me to judge what he says or prejudges or whatever. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s a very simple thing as far as I&#8217;m concerned. And I&#8217;ve told you this about three times now. Maybe somebody else doesn&#8217;t think like I do. But you seem to want to know why I think as I do. And I&#8217;ve told you &#8212; I think at this time, and with the circumstances that face America at this time, there is no better person available, not even close, to do what he can do, what he&#8217;s capable of doing. Rather than get into all these little side things &#8212; this happened, and that happened &#8212; I&#8217;m concentrating on what I think is the most important thing, and that&#8217;s getting the U.S. on track.

The image shows two men hunched over a dining room table, bearing knives and forks. On the table lays a man in a suit, who looks vaguely like Podesta. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to be the guy with the fork,&rdquo; Podesta quips to his colleagues, if they ask about the image, &ldquo;than the guy on the table.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>No one can argue that Podesta has been anyone&#8217;s meal this primary season, and to the extent he has succeeded in his role, the same can be said of his boss, Hillary Clinton. On Tuesday, with a win in Pennsylvania and four other states, she emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s voting, rival Bernie Sanders needed to win two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch up with Clinton&rsquo;s lead. After Clinton&rsquo;s Acela Corridor sweep, Sanders path to the nomination is all but closed.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"12\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4770794081001-12\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1QyTkPN\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4770794081001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><div class=\"clearvideofloat\"><\/div>\n<p>At the center of Clinton effort has been Podesta, a commanding presence in Clinton&#8217;s orbit. When asked in Iowa just before the caucuses about how Podesta yields sticks and carrots, Campaign Manager Robbie Mook offered a puzzled look. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s John Podesta, you just do what he says,&rdquo; Mook replied. It has been Podesta who has been charged with keeping the campaign coherent in the face of stumbles and setbacks, something that the 2008 Clinton operation failed to do. And it has been Podesta&mdash; part coach, part gatekeeper, judge and jury, director, fundraiser, policy wonk and strategist&mdash;who has overseen the Clinton effort.<\/p>\n<p>A lifelong runner, he has meticulously plotted every relay leg of the effort, has been deputized to confront Clinton on her failures and missteps, charged with keeping the unruly bands of Clinton family and friends in line, and has been spotted in Clinton&#8217;s Brooklyn campaign headquarters standing on a chair with a bull horn, pumping up her 20-something staff. Podesta has also begun looking forward. For the general election, he asked Obama veteran Jennifer O&rsquo;Malley Dillon months ago to start gaming out of a general election operation strategy versus various potential opponents&mdash;strategies she is already working with the Democratic National Committee to put in place should Clinton prevail&mdash;so they&rsquo;d be ready for that turn when it came. Interviews with more than a dozen colleagues over the last several months reveal that Podesta is the first and last word on any issue, the primary and often only point of contact for much of exiled Hillary-land (Podesta stocked this campaign with professional campaigners, eschewing Clinton loyalists), everybody and nobody&rsquo;s boss and simultaneously the campaign mascot and the wise man. Podesta is, in short, the man behind the Clinton campaign curtain.<\/p>\n<p>Now he must lead next phase of the pivot to the general election, a process that began in earnest after Clinton won in South Carolina. On the charter plane out of Charleston that night, Podesta and Clinton toasted over a couple of blended Scotches. Neither are big whisky drinkers, but it was what they had on hand. For the first time, it was clear that the existential threat of Sanders had begun to fade. As is his style, Podesta did not let the toast linger, and promptly cut the celebration short: this isn&rsquo;t over by a long shot, he warned. Don&rsquo;t rest on your laurels. You still have many miles yet to go. Before they&rsquo;d entered Tennessee airspace en route to Memphis, it was back to business.<\/p>\n<p>THE ROOTS OF A PARTNERSHIP<br \/>\nIn many ways this is the job Podesta has dreamed about for 20 years, though his first interaction with Hillary Clinton in her husband&rsquo;s White House didn&rsquo;t suggest it would ever happen. When Podesta was staff secretary, the then White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty gave Podesta an extra job: handling the scandals of Bill Clinton&#8217;s first term. &ldquo;You needed to isolate those as much as you can and keep the staff focused on the president and his agenda,&rdquo; McLarty said. &ldquo;I asked John to spear head that. He was superb.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-17.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=435\" alt=\"President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton eat with their aides in downtown The Hague, on May 28, 1997.

Around the table from left, Kelly Craighead, Bruce Lindsay, and deputy chief of staff John Podesta. <\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As part of that job, Podesta headed up the internal investigation on Travelgate, a scandal started when Hillary Clinton in May 1993 helped direct the firing of seven people from the travel office&mdash;usually non-political staff who continue through changes of Administrations. Ultimately, several investigations found the firings were inappropriate and most of the staff was reinstated. Podesta&rsquo;s report was surprisingly critical of the First Lady&rsquo;s role. Though no charges ever came of the scandal, the affair left Podesta in her doghouse. But the two policy wonks weren&rsquo;t estranged for long. &ldquo;When he left the White House he said to me he&rsquo;d only go back for one job: Hillary&rsquo;s chief of staff,&rdquo; John&rsquo;s brother Tony Podesta recalls. John Podesta declined to comment on the record for this story.<\/p>\n<p>Podesta did eventually go back for other jobs, becoming Bill&rsquo;s chief of staff in the final years&mdash;weathering Monica Lewinsky and impeachment with his friendships with both Clintons still in tact, that in itself a marvel. Though Podesta wouldn&rsquo;t directly work for the Clintons again for years, he remained a key player in their orbit, publicly encouraging her to run for the Senate; helping raise money with his brother, with whom he co-founded Washington&rsquo;s fourth largest lobbying firm, the Podesta Group; and then with the blessings and support of both Clintons launching his think tank, the Center for American Progress in 2003.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-18.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=421\" alt=\"President Bill Clinton talks with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta on Jan. 20, 2001, in his last moments in the Oval Office before the president-elect's inauguration in in Washington.\" height=\"421\"><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-18.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=421\" alt=\"President Bill Clinton talks with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta on Jan. 20, 2001, in his last moments in the Oval Office before the president-elect's inauguration in in Washington.\" height=\"421\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Sharon Farmer&mdash;The White House\/AP<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >President Bill Clinton talks with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta on Jan. 20, 2001, in his last moments in the Oval Office before the president-elect&#8217;s inauguration in in Washington.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>When Clinton first began preparing for her first run for President in late 2006, Podesta chose to stay on the sidelines. But he made his opinions known. At a meeting at Clinton&rsquo;s Washington home in December 2006, Podesta weighed in on the then New York senator&rsquo;s nascent campaign. He thought her message of strength and experience made her too much like Microsoft when the market wanted Apple&mdash;something shiny and new, according to two aides who were present. During the campaign, when Apple overtook Microsoft in market value, Podesta emailed the story around&mdash;it was one of the only comments he made during that campaign.<\/p>\n<p>For Podesta, the lesson was clear: if she ran again, Clinton had to be seen to be fighting for every vote and taking the primary seriously. Her slogan this time is &#8220;Fighting For You.&#8221; Ahead of her July 2015 speech at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?327052-1\/hillary-clinton-economic-policy-address\">the New School<\/a> laying out her economic agenda, Podesta sat down with Clinton, her chief policy adviser Jake Sullivan and a couple of other staffers and thought about what her economic message should be, particularly knowing they&rsquo;d be running against Sanders. Podesta advised her to pick things about which she was passionate&mdash;things like equal pay and childcare, say people present at the meetings. That speech has remained the heart of her message. &ldquo;John is a very systematic thinker. One of the first things he did was look at operational strategy and look at lessons of 2008 and correct the mistakes,&rdquo; Sullivan said.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-19.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=420\" alt=\"John Podesta, left, and Hillary Clinton attend the National Clean Energy Summit 7.0 on Sept. 4, 2014 in Las Vegas.\" height=\"420\"><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-19.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=420\" alt=\"John Podesta, left, and Hillary Clinton attend the National Clean Energy Summit 7.0 on Sept. 4, 2014 in Las Vegas.\" height=\"420\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >David Becker&mdash;Getty Images for National Clean<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >John Podesta, left, and Hillary Clinton attend the National Clean Energy Summit 7.0 on Sept. 4, 2014 in Las Vegas.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>CAMPAIGN FRUITION<br \/>\nThat didn&rsquo;t mean the second campaign would be easy. Clinton, who herself acknowledges is not a natural politician, has struggled to beat Sanders, a 74-year old self-described socialist from Vermont. Her choice as Secretary of State to use a private e-mail server rather than government email, and the subsequent Congressional and criminal investigations into whether that potentially exposed top secret information, haunted her and made many question her credibility. And she suffered from relateability problems. She admitted in 2013 that she hadn&rsquo;t driven a car since 1996, the tens of millions raised by the Clinton Foundation were scrutinized, and Sanders rarely lets a day go by when he doesn&rsquo;t remind voters about how Wall Street banks paid her hundreds of thousands of dollars to give speeches to their elite ranks.<\/p>\n<p>The photo finish in Iowa shouldn&rsquo;t have been so expensive. She shouldn&rsquo;t have lost New Hampshire by 20 points, or Michigan at all. But this was the race that Podesta had planned for, for better and worse. Early on, he led the charge to keep everyone else in line, even as failures and setbacks strained the system. When Clinton&#8217;s favored attack dog, David Brock began raising questions about Sanders&#8217; health, Podesta quickly shut the news down with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?327052-1\/hillary-clinton-economic-policy-address\">a public Tweet<\/a>. &#8220;Chill out. We&#8217;re fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test.&rdquo; When someone in the Clinton circle put out word to Politico that staff might reorganize, it was Podesta <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/johnpodesta\/status\/696809356566929408\">who similarly restored order<\/a>. &ldquo;There is zero truth to what you may be reading,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Podesta made a conscious effort to course correct this campaign. Her first presidential campaign was hamstrung by back biting and leaking, as staffers lobbied for their strategies in the press. She spent too much money on media and neglected her field and technology teams. That staff was a coterie of longtime Clinton friends and aides picked more for their loyalty than their competence, leading her to change campaign managers mid-race in a bid to reset but her victories were never strong enough to allow her to catch up with Barack Obama&#8217;s delegate lead. Podesta this time around invested heavily in field and technology early on, two areas where Clinton felt Obama had out-organized her. And only a handful of staffers worked for Clinton before this campaign, leaving the management of decades of Clinton insiders almost exclusively to Podesta. He also changed the tone and message of the campaign, encouraging Clinton to play up the historic nature of her campaign and speak often about women&#8217;s issues and eschewing big rallies, no venues where Clinton shines, for intimate roundtables.<\/p>\n<p>At a Clinton campaign senior staff retreat over the holidays in late 2015, each person was asked to bring an object that had some symbolic value to him or her. Podesta brought a snap bracelet from a relay race in Toronto. The campaign chair told the group about how in this particular race, one of his teammates had been shot in the leg running in the middle of the night. It turned out only to be by a pellet gun, but despite the drama all the runners finished the race. &ldquo;John said it was a lesson about how we&rsquo;ve got to take care of each other, no matter how bad things get and also to always keep looking at the finish line&mdash;though hopefully none of us will get shot,&rdquo; said Mook. Podesta gave Mook the bracelet, and he carries it with him everywhere.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/lazy-load\/images\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-13.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=349\" alt=\"John Podesta stands outside Union Station in Washington on July 13, 2010.\" height=\"349\"><noscript><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-2016-election-photos-13.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=75&#038;strip=color&#038;h=349\" alt=\"John Podesta stands outside Union Station in Washington on July 13, 2010.\" height=\"349\"><\/noscript>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Luke Sharrett&mdash;The New York Times\/Redux<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >John Podesta stands outside Union Station in Washington on July 13, 2010.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>EAT OR BE EATEN<br \/>\nAs Clinton makes the pivot to the general election, she is faced with the challenge of uniting her party. Sanders in <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4307384\/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-nomination-support-2016-election\/\">an MSNBC town hall on Monday<\/a> hinted that for his endorsement, he&rsquo;d like to see Clinton embrace single payer health care and stronger stances on climate change, to which Clinton scoffed in her own town hall that winning means something. But the truth is, she will need Sanders&rsquo; help to unite and excite the party base around her, particularly among young and progressive voters.<\/p>\n<p>She also has historically high negative polls ratings: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/03\/22\/politics\/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\/\">a CBS poll in March<\/a> found her underwater with voters by 21 percentage points with just 31% approving of her and 52% disapproving. Sure, Clinton benefits from the increasingly likely nomination on the Republican side of Donald Trump, who is even more disliked than she is: the same CBS poll found Trump with a 24% approval rating to a whopping 57% disapproval for a net deficit of 33 percentage points. The other Republican in the running, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, also suffers from more American disapproval than approval.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the general election portends to be one of the nastiest in history, with Trump already accusing Bill Clinton of preying on women akin to Bill Cosby. Not to mention, the ever-hanging threat of indictments relating to the e-mail scandal. Yet through it all, Podesta has stuck to his mantra, seeking to stay the aggressor not the victim: like any good runner he has mapped out the course prepared for the hills and challenges.<\/p>\n<p>The day of the Nevada caucuses found Podesta was at his brother&rsquo;s house in Washington, overseeing a fundraiser for wealthy supporters. Podesta&mdash;a gourmet chef who often jokes he&rsquo;d be fat if it weren&rsquo;t for all the running&mdash;cooked for 200, part of a series of fundraisers where he and a celebrity chef cooked for donors. This time, he was whipping up Sunday brunch with Carla Hall, co-host of ABC&rsquo;s The Chew. The message of the painting in his Brooklyn office was not far from his mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m behind the counter,&rdquo; he half joked to the crowd, according to two people present, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t want to be the meal.&rdquo;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Hillary Clinton in the fight against Republicans. But he is not giving up on central parts of his platform.<\/p>\n<p>At a town hall meeting hosted by MSNBC on Monday evening in Philadelphia, Sanders was asked what he would do to mobilize his supporters to continue his policy proposals, assuming he lost at the Democratic convention.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sanders said<\/span> that &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If we end up losing,&#8221; it would be &#8220;incumbent upon [Clinton] to tell millions of people who right now do not believe in establishment politics and establishment economics&#8221; that she supported Sanders&#8217; Medicare-for-all plan. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I think Secretary Clinton is going to have to explain to millions of young people and a lot of other people that climate change is a real crisis and incrementalism is just not going to solve it,&#8221; he added. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Whether Sanders throws his support behind Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination &mdash; and how enthusiastically he endorses her &mdash; will play a major role in determining whether his supporters end up backing her too. That will give Sanders some leverage, even if he loses the Democratic nomination, in shaping the party&#8217;s platform.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton is highly unlikely to embrace any of Sanders&#8217; policy proposals, which would cost trillions of dollars over the next ten years. She has repeatedly rejected those ideas, saying that Sanders&#8217; Medicare-for-all proposal would require the United States to scrap the Affordable Care Act and that his free tuition at public colleges would require compliance from Republican governors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-video\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"14\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4714085799001-14\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1Ta8IEc\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4714085799001\"><\/object><\/div><\/div><div class=\"clearvideofloat\"><\/div>\n<p>The former Secretary of State said as much on Monday night, during her own town hall meeting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am winning.

Both Cruz and Kasich are mathematically incapable of securing the GOP nomination on the first ballot, and each must stop Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates if they hope to stand a chance at a contested convention.<\/p>\n<p>The Kasich campaign first approached the Cruz campaign about coordinating their efforts after the Houston debate in late February, only to be rejected. Last week, at the spring meeting of the Republican National Committee in Hollywood, Fla., where both Cruz and Kasich and their top strategists made presentations, Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe approached Kasich senior strategist John Weaver about cooperating in the coming races, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. The details were then sorted out in a series of telephone conversations over the weekend.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead,&#8221; Roe said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Weaver echoed the comments in a statement of his own. &#8220;We will focus our time and resources in New Mexico and Oregon, both areas that are structurally similar to the Northeast politically, where Gov. Kasich is performing well. We would expect independent third-party groups to do the same and honor the commitments made by the Cruz and Kasich campaigns,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The three races could be pivotal to stopping Trump from reaching a majority of convention delegates on the first ballot. Indiana&#8217;s May 3 primary is winner takes all by congressional district and statewide, meaning Trump would earn none of the 57 delegates if Cruz is able to secure a simple plurality. New Mexico and Oregon are both proportional contests &mdash; on 24 delegates June 7 and 28 delegates May 17, respectively &mdash; but the campaigns believe their more moderate demographics favor Kasich as a Trump alternative.<\/p>\n<p>The move to harmonize their efforts fulfills a long-standing wish of anti-Trump forces within the GOP, who have been calling for a more strategic approach than what has transpired in recent primaries and caucuses. Each campaign has argued that the other was spoiling their efforts to take on Trump, encouraging the other to drop out of the race. Their lack of coordination allowed Trump to secure more delegates than he would otherwise, and saw the Cruz and Kasich campaigns, and affiliated outside groups, spend millions attacking one another rather than the front-runner.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes days after Trump won 90 of New York&#8217;s 95 delegates in a rout, and days before he is expected to have another strong showing in primaries in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland and Delaware.<\/p>\n<p>Both campaigns said they would aggressively compete in the remaining eight contests.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

weren&rsquo;t for them. They are the city&rsquo;s rebar specialists, warehouse managers and mechanics among many other professions. At a time when political candidates in both parties are <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4256739\/hillary-clinton-rust-belt\/\" target=\"_blank\">lamenting the decline of manufacturing jobs<\/a> ahead of <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4290390\/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-lead-poll-new-york-primary\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tuesday&#8217;s New York primary<\/a>, the &ldquo;whole city depends on them,&rdquo; says Dakota Santiago, who photographed New York&rsquo;s working class laborers. &ldquo;Here they are, like an ant colony keeping everything running.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A New York <em>Daily News<\/em> mailer and tail man himself, Santiago learned about manual work from his father and his uncle. The former, Alfred Santiago, drove a <em>Daily News<\/em> truck for 50 years; the latter, Joel Moreno, would invite him out for the last runs of his route on a waste management truck.<br \/>\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Whenever I would stay at my uncle&rsquo;s place in Queens, he would ask if I wanted to go with him on his last one or two runs, which at the time was actually the underground complex for the World Trade Center when it was still standing,&#8221; says Santiago. &#8220;And so we would pick up the containers at the World Trade Center and we used to dump it on Varick Avenue in Bushwick, where there was a waste management transfer area.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Santiago graduated high school, he was proud to follow in his father&#8217;s footstep as a New York <em>Daily News<\/em> employee. Newspapers were special to the photographer, whose interest in the visual arts began with drawing. He would leaf through the papers for reference photos, rendering the images of the world as he saw them until this no longer sufficed. That&#8217;s when he fell in love with photography. His series of portraits, <em>Working Class New York<\/em>, shot on medium format film, are Santiago&#8217;s first photographic endeavor.<\/p>\n<p>Santiago used film to mirror his subjects&#8217; manual work. &ldquo;I just like the hands on aspects of it. I feel a little bit more proud working with it because it&rsquo;s not so dependent on a computer.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Shy and new to photography, Santiago began exploring the streets he remembered from his childhood, camera at the hip as he waded through familiar scenes for the first time on foot. &ldquo;When I go to the scrap yards I see all the trucks lined up, all the same trucks that my uncle used to drive.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He approached his subjects, complete strangers, as they worked on the streets and on open sites. Most were receptive to his venture of documenting New York&rsquo;s under-appreciated working class. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in Manhattan you see it all, but where did it come from? And nobody really asks and nobody really cares. I wanted to bring that out, I just wanted to put a face of the workers that keep this city running.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Santiago emphasized that the manufacturing workforce is shrinking, but it has not disappeared. The sector as a whole has declined 60 percent in New York since the 1940s when it was a source of economic prosperity in the state.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Dakota Santiago<\/strong> is a freelance photographer based in Bayonne, N.J.
