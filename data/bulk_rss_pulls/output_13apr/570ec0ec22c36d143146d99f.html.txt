On Tuesday morning, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed into law HB 1523âthe âProtecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Actââone of the most sweeping of the nationâs âreligious libertyâ bills that are making the rounds in numerous red-state capitals this year. In the press they are often referred to as âanti-LGBT bills,â because they would give legal cover to those who want to discriminate against LGBT people out of âsincerely held religious belief.â Critics such as Ben Needham, director of Human Rights Campaignâs Project One America, has said the measure is âprobably the worst religious freedom bill to date.â But there is an even more radical agenda behind these bills, and the atrocious attempt to deprive LGBT Americans of their rights is only a part of it.

							If you are religiously opposed to other people having non-marital sex, Mississippi's "religious freedom" law could be the law for you.
						
 
According to State Senator Jennifer Branning, one of the Mississippi lawâs original backers, the real victims of the story are not the LGBT couples denied services but people âwho cannot in good conscience provide services for a same-sex marriage.â These are the true targets of discrimination, and we are invited to sympathize with the proverbial florist who balks at providing flowers at a gay wedding or the restaurant owner who refuses to serve a same-sex couple celebrating their wedding anniversary. But the text of the law also specifically protects the âsincerely held religious beliefâ that âsexual relations are properly reserved toâ a marriage between a woman and a man. So if you are religiously opposed to other people having non-marital sex, this could be the law for you.				
					
					
It is also inaccurate to think that this law is just about those who wish to refuse to perform a service. One of the more disconcerting sections of the law is that which discusses people who provide foster-care services. The government, we are told, will no longer be allowed to take action against any foster parent that âguides, instructs, or raises a childâ¦in a manner consistent with a sincerely held religious belief.â If you want to know what that could mean, check out Focus on the Familyâs âspare the rodâ philosophy of child rearing. On its website, the religious-right advocacy group offers handy tips on âthe Biblical Approach to Spanking.â				
					
					
If the point were only to spare the fine moral sentiments of a few florists, why would the lawâs sponsors seek such a wide-ranging exemption from the laws and norms that apply to the rest of society? A helpful clue can be found in a letter that the American Family Association sent out in support of the Mississippi bill before it was passed. (The AFA has been named a âhate groupâ by the Southern Poverty Law Center since 2010.) The bill, said the AFA, is crucial because it protects the AFA, and groups like it, from the âgovernmental threat of losing their tax exempt status.â

There is a revealing irony in that statement. Tax exemption is a kind of gift from the government, a privilege. It is an indirect way of funneling money from taxpayers to groups that engage in certain kinds of activities (like charity work or nonprofit education)âand not other kinds of activities (like political activism). The AFA is right to worry about the governmental threat to their governmental subsidy. As our society views the kinds of activities they endorse with increasing skepticism, the justification for continued subsidies and privileges from the government will diminish.

The people who drafted the bill on behalf of the Mississippi legislators get it.

This is why the very first âdiscriminatory actionâ by the government the law prohibits is âto alter in any way the tax treatmentâ of any person or organization that abides by the newly sanctioned religious beliefs.				
					
					
Itâs about more than money, of course. The AFA and its allies on the religious right want to carve out a sphere in American public life where religionâtheir religionâtrumps the law.

None other than the late Antonin Scalia put his finger on the problem. To make an individualâs obedience to the law âcontingent upon the lawâs coincidence with his religious beliefsâ amounts to âpermitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, âto become a law unto himself,ââ he said. It âcontradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.â Scalia made these comments in his 1990 majority opinion in Employment Division v. Smith. In that case, the majority ruled that the state of Oregon could deny unemployment benefits to a pair of individuals who violated a state ban on the use of peyote, even though their use of the drug was part of a religious ritual. It was the overreaction to that verdictâon both the left and the rightâthat produced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Though intended only to ensure that laws did not needlessly burden the religious liberty of individuals, the RFRA sparked a wave of unintended consequences. It effectively planted the demon seeds of the current crop of âreligious libertyâ bills.

Employment Division, as it happened, involved a religionâthat practiced by the Native American Churchâwith which Scalia likely did not identify. Which brings up a crucial point about the Mississippi law and its numerous cousins. These âreligious libertyâ bills are really intended only for a particular variety of religion. Indeed, HB 1523 protects you only if your religion involves a specific set of beliefsâsuch as the religious belief that âmanâ and âwomanâ ârefer to an individualâs immutable biological sex,â and that âsexual relations are properly reserved toâ marriage. To speak frankly, the law was designed to advance the claims of conservative Christians, and it would never have become law otherwise. If you think that every religion will find as much liberty in the laws of Mississippi, then I have a Satanic temple to sell you.

If you think that every religion will find as much liberty in the laws of Mississippi, then I have a Satanic temple to sell you.				
					
					
		

None other than the late Antonin Scalia put his finger on the problem. To make an individualâs obedience to the law âcontingent upon the lawâs coincidence with his religious beliefsâ amounts to âpermitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, âto become a law unto himself,ââ he said. It âcontradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.â Scalia made these comments in his 1990 majority opinion in Employment Division v. Smith. In that case, the majority ruled that the state of Oregon could deny unemployment benefits to a pair of individuals who violated a state ban on the use of peyote, even though their use of the drug was part of a religious ritual. It was the overreaction to that verdictâon both the left and the rightâthat produced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Though intended only to ensure that laws did not needlessly burden the religious liberty of individuals, the RFRA sparked a wave of unintended consequences. It effectively planted the demon seeds of the current crop of âreligious libertyâ bills.				
			

							The AFA and its allies on the religious right want to carve out a sphere in American public life where their religion trumps the law.
						
 
Employment Division, as it happened, involved a religionâthat practiced by the Native American Churchâwith which Scalia likely did not identify. Which brings up a crucial point about the Mississippi law and its numerous cousins. These âreligious libertyâ bills are really intended only for a particular variety of religion. Indeed, HB 1523 protects you only if your religion involves a specific set of beliefsâsuch as the religious belief that âmanâ and âwomanâ ârefer to an individualâs immutable biological sex,â and that âsexual relations are properly reserved toâ marriage.

How soon before no Jews allowed? No blacks allowed? No Muslims allowed? No non-Christians allowed? It is just a short step. These Christians make the laws in their favor only, then cry when anyone shows them up to be hypocrites. Our vacation has been cancelled. We are really running out of states to visit. Too bad since we are retired and spend a lot of money traveling. Accept everyone or go broke.

Makes perfect sense-the victim is the person providing services!  Why didn&apos;t I think of that?  
Classic, really.   The right wing Christians seem to have a penchant for always positioning themselves as the persecuted victim, no matter how twisted a path it took to get to that conclusion.  The rest of us are always laying heaviness on THEM, you must keep that in mind.  No matter how many of my gay compadres get the crap beat out of them, they are the ones suffering.  This never changes in their fragile, fake world.

To make religious beliefs as the norm by which any human being should carry on with life is useless, damaging and hypocritical; if we want to put in  practice our beliefs professing any religion that should be a personal choice and not an interference with the way each individual wants to live his or her own life that does not violate any law.

Another example of the wisdom of a wall between church and state. Religion informs but church should not encourage state to enforce.

This is the latest effort by the state where I grew up to write its own laws when certain people in the state--though by no means all of them, or anywhere near all of them--dislike the law of the land.  Outside pressure will once again have to be brought to bear on the governor and legislature.  It gets old.

Every time I wonder whether I&apos;m being too hard on the states of the American South - home of the most backward, uneducated, unproductive, resentful, violent and nasty part of our nation - they do something new to show me that they deserve their odious reputation that makes them the laughing stock and pariah of the civilized world.

Perhaps an alternative objection is more economic justice.  All these businesses and churches are firmly attached to tax payer funded physical infrastructure as well as tax payer funded services - law enforcement, fire protection, ambulance & EMT services not to mention public schools or community hospitals.

These bigots expect everyone who pays taxes (directly or indirectly) to support their business or church economics while refusing service to some tax payers.  

These bigots should be allowed to buy land, install well, sewage mgt, solud waste mgt, power, law enforcement, etc.  Their gated stand alone community can exclude whomever.  Gate w/guard can check entrants for membership cards.  No one offended by Sons of Ham, LGBT, unmarried couples with children, interracial couples, muslims, jews, non evangelical christians, whatever. 

Getting agreement about what objectionable behavior would be interesting while sorting out who can be members.

By promulgating the tenets of a religious belief system it appears that the state of Mississippi is supporting the establishment of a religion that the first amendment seeks to prevent. This insidious attempt of the state to reach into the private lives of its residents is a dangerous precedent that I hope will be challenged by the likes of the AU, the ACLU and other organizations of similar intentions.
