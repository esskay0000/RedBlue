The Boston Globe on SundayÂ envisioned what the first months of a Donald Trump presidency would look like with a satirical front page and critical op-ed piece.

On the cover, an editor’s note explains the intent to show the âdangers of Trump’s vision.â

âThisÂ isÂ DonaldÂ TrumpâsÂ America,â the note reads. âWhatÂ youÂ readÂ onÂ thisÂ pageÂ isÂ what mightÂ happenÂ ifÂ theÂ GOPÂ front-Â­runner canÂ putÂ hisÂ ideasÂ intoÂ practice, his words into action. Many Americans mightÂ findÂ thisÂ visionÂ appealing, butÂ theÂ GlobeâsÂ editorialÂ board findsÂ itÂ deeplyÂ troubling.â

With the headline âDEPORTATIONS TO BEGINâ splashed above the fold, the page imagines riots as âPresidentâ Trump calls for the tripling of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

âTheÂ presidentÂ madeÂ theÂ announcement inÂ aÂ nationallyÂ televisedÂ address lastÂ nightÂ fromÂ theÂ OldÂ PostÂ Office buildingÂ inÂ Washington,Â D.C.,Â nowÂ a TrumpÂ InternationalÂ Hotel,â the satirical article reads. âInÂ aÂ surprise moveÂ afterÂ theÂ speech,Â TrumpÂ invited AttorneyÂ GeneralÂ ChrisÂ Christie toÂ standÂ rightÂ nextÂ toÂ himÂ atÂ theÂ podium toÂ fieldÂ questions. â#no_side_eye forÂ ChristieÂ thisÂ time,â tweetedÂ Fox NewsÂ ChannelÂ reporterÂ MegynÂ Kelly, whoÂ wasÂ coveringÂ theÂ speechÂ fromÂ a sportsÂ barÂ nearÂ RockefellerÂ CenterÂ because she has been placed on a White House blacklist.â

The editorial page also describes U.S. soldiers refusing orders to kill the families of ISIS militants and sweeping changes to libel law, references to Trump’s controversial statements concerningÂ terrorism and the press.

In an accompanyingÂ op-ed, the Globe’s editorial board calls on the GOP to stop Trump.

âAt some point, after the election, Republicans will also need to ask themselves some tough questions about how their actions and inactions made the party vulnerable to Trump,â the op-ed reads. âChasing short-term political gains, the GOP missed a lot of chances to fight the hateful currents that now threaten to overwhelm it.Â For now, Republicans ought to focus on doing the right thing: putting up every legitimate roadblock to Trump that they can.â
