Donald Trump has trashed professional politicians during his presidential campaign, but that's the class he's looking to for his vice presidential pick.

"I have the business âÂ let's call it talents," Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe when asked about the veepstakes. "And I think I'll probably go the political route, somebody that can help me with legislation."

While not providing specific names, Trump said he will also look for "somebody that can help me get things passed and somebody that's been friends with the senators and the congressman and all."

Speculation about Trump's running mate is already in overdrive, with names ranging from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie â the first major politician to endorse the businessman â to Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin.

Trump told MSNBC he wants help passing congressional legislation "so we don't have to go the executive order route as much as (President)Â Obama did, you know, where he can't get anything approved so he just keeps signing executive orders.

"But more than likely, I would go the political route."
