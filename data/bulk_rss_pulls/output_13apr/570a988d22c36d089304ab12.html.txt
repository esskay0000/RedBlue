NEW YORK â Talk of a contested convention has come to the Democratic presidential race. But Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) expressed sharply different views about whether such a scenario is likely.

Speaking on CNN on Sunday morning, Clinton shot down the idea that Democrats were headed for a contentious intra-party dispute at the convention in Philadelphia about who will be their presidential nominee.

"I feel good about the upcoming contests, and IÂ expect to be the nominee," Clinton said, noting that she has received more than 2.5 million more votes than Sanders and is leading him in pledged delegates. "I intend to have the number of delegates that are required to be nominated."

She added that once she isÂ nominated, she would move to the task of unifying the party.

"We need to run a unified Democratic Party campaign to bring as many people on our side as possible," she added.

But Sanders insisted that his campaign has "a path" to best Clinton in terms of pledged delegates, whoÂ are awarded proportionally based on victories in primaries and caucuses.

He added that superdelegates, party activists and officials who are free to support whichever candidate they choose, will switch their allegiances from Clinton to his campaign.

"If we continue to do better in general election polls in terms of defeating Trump by a much larger margin than SecretaryÂ Clinton,Â youâre going to get a lotÂ of superdelegates who say what's most important is that we donât have a Trump in the White House and weâre going to support BernieÂ Sanders," Sanders said.

Asked whether he would contest the Democratic nomination, Sanders said it depends on whether either candidate ends up having enough support going into the convention.

"If neither candidate ends up having the number of votes that they need, yeah, IÂ think there'll be some discussion," Sanders added.
