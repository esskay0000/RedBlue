The ladies of "The View" can't believe Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump for presidentÂ â just can't believe it! And no one is more shocked and disappointed than Whoopi Goldberg.

The retired neurosurgeon's decision earlier this month to back the Republican presidential front-runner surprised many political observers, given that Trump once compared Carson to a child molesterÂ (both have "pathological" problems that can't be cured, the billionaire said in November).

Even Carson, who briefly led the pack of GOP candidates last fall, acknowledged Thursday on the ABC daytime talk show that he had planned to "remain neutral" after dropping out.

"But then I realized that the political establishment was aligning to protect their turf," he explained. "And they don't like the idea of people who are not beholden to them â and who cannot be controlled â coming into Washington, D.C."

Carson's rationale didn't satisfy Goldberg: "I hate to ask this question, but you have aligned yourself with a man who has bashed women, made countless racist remarks, and you're Ben Carson! Why would you align yourself with that?"

The host seemed to be suggesting that CarsonÂ â one of the 10 men Americans admire most, according to Gallup, and the second-most-admired African-American man, behind only President ObamaÂ â ought to be particularly troubled by Trump rhetoric that many view as race-baiting.

"You have to look at the good and the bad," Carson replied. "There is no perfect person."

He went on to tout what he sees as Trump's pioneering acceptance of racial and religious minorities at his ritzy clubs and the glowing reviews Carson has heard from the real estate mogul's black employees.

Still nonplussed, Goldberg exclaimed at one point, "You're Ben Carson! You're so much better than this!"

"The View" itself, we should note,Â has beenÂ criticized for over-the-line commentary during this campaign, when the hosts joked that Republican candidate Carly Fiorina's face looked "demented" during a debate and would make a good Halloween mask.

Fiorina appeared on the show shortly thereafter and said she has "skin plenty thick enough to take whatever people throw at me." But her interview quickly turned into a testy exchange with Goldberg and Joy Behar over abortion and Planned Parenthood.

There's a lesson here for politiciansÂ â past, present and future: Don'tÂ go onÂ "The View" and expect softballs.
