Though John Kasich finds himself trailing in the Republican race,Â with his establishment friends now rallying around Ted Cruz, he may be the only one who could beat Hillary Clinton in November.

Thatâs according to a new poll by Monmouth University, which found that while Clinton beat both Cruz and Donald Trump in head-to-head scenarios, the former secretary of State trailed Kasich by 6 percentage points.

With Cruz pitted head-to-head against Clinton, he trailed by 6 percentage points. Trump trailed the Democratic front-runner by 10 pointsÂ in a general election scenario.

The pollâs conclusion backs an earlier poll this week by Quinnipiac University, which also found Kasich to be the only Republican candidate to defeat Clinton head-to-head, leading her by eight percentage points.

Despite Kasich, Ohio's governor, being potentiallyÂ the only Republican candidate who could defeat Clinton in a general election, support for his campaign has so far failed to materialize.

Establishment Republicans,Â including Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham, are all voicing support for Cruz, whoâs proven a stronger primary challenge to Trump, the front-runner.

Graham joked about his partyâs failure to support Kasich on MSNBC Thursday, citing another figure suggesting KasichÂ could lead Clinton.

âOf all the people running. John Kasich wins by 11 points against Hillary, so he's absolutely out," Graham said. "Nobody wants a loser like that."

"Would John Kasich make a better president than Ted Cruz?" MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski asked.

âThink so,â Graham said.

The Monmouth Poll took place March 17-20 over phone and includedÂ 848 registered voters. The margin of error is +/- 3.4 percentage points.
