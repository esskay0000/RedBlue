I met Carol Tart at the opening of the Sanders campaignâs South Philadelphia office about a month before the primary. In a room filled with young people ornamented with tattoos and beards, and a handful of older white radicals, Tart, a striking woman wearing a stylish hat, was easy to spot. For one thing, she was the only African-American woman I could see. And no one was talking to her. So I went over and asked what had brought her to the event.

âIf you want an honest answer, I came to see how many other black people would be here,â she said. âNow I understand why Bernie has had a hard time getting people to come over to his side. I live five blocks from hereâand Iâm very politically involved. Iâm heartbroken.â		
Pennsylvania was always going to be a tough state for Sanders. In 2008, when over 432,000 Democrats turned out in Philadelphia alone, Barack Obama got 65 percent of their votes. He still lost the state by 220,000 votesâgiving Hillary Clinton, who had been questioning her opponentâs electability and attacking him as an elitist for calling some Americans âbitter,â a rationale for carrying on her campaign until the convention even as she struggled to persuade superdelegates to remain neutral and let the contest play out in May and June. Back in 2008 Hillary Clinton still owned a share in the familyâs cottage on Lake Winola, near Scrantonâthe town where her father, Hugh Rodham, was raised. Both he and her younger brother, Hughie Rodham, played football for Penn State.		
So one way to look at what happened yesterday is that Pennsylvania was always Clintonâs to loseâand that she didnât lose it. Instead, she methodically rounded up almost every Democratic elected official in the stateâfrom Senator Bob Casey and Governor Tom Wolf (and former governor Ed Rendell) to the mayors of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia (along with former Philly mayor Michael Nutter, who also backed Clinton in 2008). The only prominent Democrat in the Sanders corner was John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddockâwhose own campaign to win the nomination to take on the stateâs Republican senator, Pat Toomey, fell short yesterday with just 20 percent of the vote as Katie McGinty rode a presidential endorsement and heavy backing from Emilyâs List to victory.		
This was never a fair fight. Philadelphia has been a machine town, and Pennsylvania a machine state, since a young reporter named Lincoln Steffens made a name for himself exposing âthe shame of the citiesââin 1904! And as both the Clinton and McGinty wins demonstrate, it remains a state where the machine still delivers. Though turnout in Philadelphia was 100,000 lower than in 2008, this time Clinton won 62.6 per cent.

But the temptation to seek comfort in self-righteousnessâespecially now that Sanders no longer has a plausible path to the nominationâmust be resisted. With its toxic townsâlead levels in Allentown are seven times higher than in Flint, Michigan; the water in Scranton has six times more lead than Flint; in Reading levels are five times higherârusting railroads, abandoned factories and inadequate infrastructure, Pennsylvania is a vivid illustration of the needs Clintonâs incremental tinkering will never meet. Yet it is equally true that the people most desperately in need of help in Pennsylvaniaâwhether theyâre in Pittsburgh waiting for a bus that only runs twice a day, or in Bethlehem fighting to organize a union at Sheldon Adelsonâs Sands Casino (built inside the carcass of what was once the countryâs second-largest steel mill), or in Philadelphia, where the Carlyle Group want to bring fracked gas into an already polluting refinery on the shores of the Schuylkill Riverâare also those who can least afford a Trump or Cruz presidency.		
Sandersâand his supportersâhave a responsibility to those people to keep fighting for a living wage, free public college education, truly universal healthcare, an environmentally and economically sustainable energy system, and an end to the endless wars of regime change that grind up so many men and women in the only jobs program embraced by conventional politics. None of those fights will be settled in Philadelphia, but none of them will be advanced by abandoning the field either. Sanders needs to come to the table with as strong a handâand as many delegatesâas possible.		
Yet it is precisely in his role as the head of a movement that Sandersâs performance in Pennsylvania was so disappointing. Not only because his âI stick my neck out for nobodyâ refusal to lift a finger to help John Fetterman suggested that when it counted, the campaignâs mantra of âNot me, usâ was just an empty slogan. Or because, although the Working Families Party worked their hearts out for Sanders in Pennsylvaniaâorganizing that paid off with victories in Lancaster and Readingâthey, too, have no official claim on either the organization Sanders built up or the lists of contributors he amassed. (Instead of launching a crusade to take on the Democratic machineâa fight that will be essential if Sanders and his allies are to have any hope of moving the party to the leftâSanders kept his rhetorical fire trained comfortably on Wall Street.) But because the lack of attention paid to voters like Carol Tart was symptomatic of a campaign that relentlesslyâand successfullyâwent after the working-class white voters that gave Hillary Clinton victory in the state in 2008, while never making a similar effort to win over African-Americans.		
Let me be clear about this: The Clinton campaign has done everything it could to paint Sandersâs supporters as âoverwhelmingly white,â as part of a strategy aimed at denying both white and black progressives permission to vote for the candidate who was obviously far more progressive on almost every issue. Yet apart from the brilliantâbut entirely unofficialâ#BernieMadeMeWhite Twitter campaign, this strategy got very little pushback. Instead, Sanders kept scheduling rallies at college towns, and relying on white indie rockers to warm up his crowds.		
For a whileâwhen he kept racking up surprise victoriesâthat may have looked like a smart move. But now that Sanders isnât going to be president, his supporters and the movement he leads need to grapple with the reality that black votersâin Philadelphia, but also in Hartford, Connecticut; Wilmington, Delaware; and Baltimore, Marylandâoverwhelmingly continue to prefer the devil they know to a future they didnât believe in. Because the truth is that even if it were possible to bring about a political revolution in this country without the full participation of African Americans, the result would not be a revolution worth fighting for or defending.		
So while there are many items on the Democratic agenda before Sandersâand his campaignâreturn to Philadelphia, my own view is that finding a way to heal the racial rift between the most reliable Democratic voters and the most progressive Democratic voters needs to be at the very top of the partyâs to-do list.

Sandersâand his supportersâhave a responsibility to those people to keep fighting for a living wage, free public college education, truly universal healthcare, an environmentally and economically sustainable energy system, and an end to the endless wars of regime change that grind up so many men and women in the only jobs program embraced by conventional politics. None of those fights will be settled in Philadelphia, but none of them will be advanced by abandoning the field either. Sanders needs to come to the table with as strong a handâand as many delegatesâas possible.		
Yet it is precisely in his role as the head of a movement that Sandersâs performance in Pennsylvania was so disappointing. Not only because his âI stick my neck out for nobodyâ refusal to lift a finger to help John Fetterman suggested that when it counted, the campaignâs mantra of âNot me, usâ was just an empty slogan. Or because, although the Working Families Party worked their hearts out for Sanders in Pennsylvaniaâorganizing that paid off with victories in Lancaster and Readingâthey, too, have no official claim on either the organization Sanders built up or the lists of contributors he amassed. (Instead of launching a crusade to take on the Democratic machineâa fight that will be essential if Sanders and his allies are to have any hope of moving the party to the leftâSanders kept his rhetorical fire trained comfortably on Wall Street.) But because the lack of attention paid to voters like Carol Tart was symptomatic of a campaign that relentlesslyâand successfullyâwent after the working-class white voters that gave Hillary Clinton victory in the state in 2008, while never making a similar effort to win over African-Americans.		
Let me be clear about this: The Clinton campaign has done everything it could to paint Sandersâs supporters as âoverwhelmingly white,â as part of a strategy aimed at denying both white and black progressives permission to vote for the candidate who was obviously far more progressive on almost every issue. Yet apart from the brilliantâbut entirely unofficialâ#BernieMadeMeWhite Twitter campaign, this strategy got very little pushback. Instead, Sanders kept scheduling rallies at college towns, and relying on white indie rockers to warm up his crowds.		
For a whileâwhen he kept racking up surprise victoriesâthat may have looked like a smart move. But now that Sanders isnât going to be president, his supporters and the movement he leads need to grapple with the reality that black votersâin Philadelphia, but also in Hartford, Connecticut; Wilmington, Delaware; and Baltimore, Marylandâoverwhelmingly continue to prefer the devil they know to a future they didnât believe in. Because the truth is that even if it were possible to bring about a political revolution in this country without the full participation of African Americans, the result would not be a revolution worth fighting for or defending.		
So while there are many items on the Democratic agenda before Sandersâand his campaignâreturn to Philadelphia, my own view is that finding a way to heal the racial rift between the most reliable Democratic voters and the most progressive Democratic voters needs to be at the very top of the partyâs to-do list.

As a SPOC (Sanders person of color), I disagree there is a huge racial rift and conclude that the circumstances of this election and these particular candidates led to the racial disparity in voting. Sanders is an outsider in the Democratic party whereas Hillary is the center of it; Sanders has and had criticized President Obama whereas Hillary campaigned as the inheritor of his legacy (the irony is not lost on me); Sanders was most successful in the rural counties of most states whereas Hillary dominated the cities. I don&apos;t believe that there is a greater trend about how progressives need to reach out to minorities; they can and will as issues pop up. 

Political parties are big slow boats; even after the captain changes course, all the sailors have to labor all day to slowly turn things around. That&apos;s what I&apos;m hoping Sanders has begun, even in defeat.
