If Tuesday night was the Amtrak primaries, Donald Trump was a freight train, barreling through his GOP opponents like Meadowlands marsh grass. Hillary Clinton also leaves the region with a head of steam, with Bernie Sanders hanging on for dear life. Avoiding all further railroad metaphors, here are our top takeaways from Tuesday's primaries:

In his victory speech Tuesday night, Trump said, "IÂ consider myself the presumptive nominee, absolutely." We're not quite willing to go that far, but he has a point. By the end of the night, Trump had more than 950 delegates in his pocket, fewer then 300 short of the 1,237 he needs to clinch the nomination.

Three weeks ago, after Ted Cruz beat Trump in Wisconsin, politics junkies got all slobbery with excitement over the possibilityÂ â nay, the near certaintyÂ â of a contested convention. After Tuesday night's vote, Trump is back on track to sealÂ the deal before Cleveland, and render wasted all that ink spilt over convention rules and second ballots.

If a contested convention doesn't come to pass, at least the political nerds of the world can still harbor dreams of a 269-269 Electoral College tie? Perhaps we've been watching too muchÂ Veep.

Ted Cruz and John Kasich apparently forged a blood alliance Sunday night, swearing themselves to the joint endeavor of Stopping Trump. By Monday, the alliance seemed to be little more than a deal to stay out of each other's way, and even that fig leaf fell off Tuesday when Kasich headed to the Hoosier State for a fundraiser after saying that was one of the states he would no longer contest. Trump then won all but a handful of delegates Tuesday night.

Trump is giving a foreign policy speech Wednesday where he will discuss his vision for NATO; maybe Cruz and Kasich can take notes on how to shore up an alliance.

If the movement to stop Trump has any hope of succeeding, the Cruz/Kasich partnership better prove successful next Tuesday in lifting the Texas senator to victory in Indiana.

After the networks called the first result for ClintonÂ â MarylandÂ â Bernie Sanders took the stage in West Virginia and vowed to fight on, regaling the crowd with an hourlong version of his stump speech that all the networks cut away from about 10 minutes in. He is the better general election candidate against Donald Trump than Clinton is, Sanders warned, and he hinted that his success was based on one "unusual" feature of his campaign: âWe are telling the truth.â

Clinton turned the other cheek and reached out to Sanders supporters, saying, basically, "we are all in this together."

"I applaud Sen.Â Sanders" for pushing the party to focus onÂ money in politics and income inequality, she said.

"Whether you support Sen. Sanders or you support me,Â there is much more that unites us than divides us," Clinton said. "We agree wages are too low and inequality is too high," among other Sanders' talking points.

Clinton's message was clear. It is time, she believes, to #HealTheBern.

Democrats in November will likely be counting on a woman to retain the White House and several female candidates in their bid to retake the Senate. Katie McGinty, a Pennsylvania Democrat who was backed by the party establishment, from President Obama on down, won a primary Tuesday against former congressman Joe Sestak. Sheâll now face Pat Toomey in the fall in one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country.

McGinty will hardly be the only Democratic woman key to the partyâs hopes of winning a majority. Thereâs Tammy Duckworth in Illinois, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire andÂ Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada to hold the seat of retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. While another female Senate candidate, Donna Edwards in Maryland, fell short Tuesday night, that was a state the party is likely to easily win no matter what.

Bottom line: If Democrats can hold all the seats they're defending, victories by McGinty, Hassan,Â Duckworth and Masto wouldÂ push Democrats to the brink of a Senate majority, needing just a few guys to help out.
