After being told for weeks that the Democratic presidential race was effectively finished, the Democratic primary voters of Indiana decided that they would like to see the contest continue.

Bernie Sanders defeated Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Tuesday by a comfortable 52.5-to-47.5 margin in Indiana, securing for the senator from Vermont his 18th state victory in a Democratic contest that many analysts said was over after Clinton won critical primaries in New York and Pennsylvania. The former secretary of state remains the leader in the race for the nomination, with a clear advantage among pledged delegates and an overwhelming advantage when superdelegates are added to the total. But the Indiana win allowed Sanders to declare: âI understand that Secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over. Iâve got some bad news for herâ¦â And it allowed Sanders supporters to talk about taking their campaign to more primary statesâKentucky, West Virginia, Oregon, Montana, New Jersey, Californiaâand on to the Democratic National Convention in July.				
					
					
Sanders backers still want to win. But even if they do not prevail, they want to use their delegate strength to work with progressive Clinton backers and non-aligned delegates to forge a platform that the senator says should be âthe strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.â				
					
					
âIn the days and weeks ahead, the Political Revolution is going to continue winning states, winning delegates, surprising skeptics, and ensuring that our call for populist progressive change is heard loud and clear in Philadelphia,â said Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of the pro-Sanders activist group Democracy for America.
The Indiana win was an especially sweet one for Sanders, as it resulted from intense campaigning on an theme that has long been central to his economic message: the need for the United States to abandon corporate-friendly âfree tradeâ policies and to embrace a worker-friendly âfair tradeâ agenda.

							“We need to end the race to the bottom...” —Bernie Sanders’s Indiana message
						
 
On a primary night when media coverage focused obsessively on billionaire Donald Trumpâs âbigâ win in the Indiana Republican primary (a win that formalized his status as the GOPâs presumed nominee), Sanders was running only slightly less well among Democrats than Trump was with Republicans. The Vermonter was carrying the vast majority of Indianaâs counties and winning blue-collar towns that have been battered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, permanent normalization of trade with China, and a host of other global agreements that have undermined workers, communities, the environment and democracy itself.				
					
					
The trade issue was vital for Sanders in Indiana, as it was for him in Michiganâthe state that shook up the race in March by handing the senator a surprise victory over Clinton. Exit polls found that nearly two-thirds of Indiana Democratic primary voters said Wall Street hurts the economy, and 46 percent said free-trade policies costs jobs.				
					
					
Sanders has made his opposition to the trade policies long favored by so many Republican and Democratic party leaders a core tenet of his presidential run from the day he announced his candidacy. During the course of the long battle for the Democratic nomination, Clinton has moved toward a more critical stance on trade issuesâraising objections to the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that she had once talked up as a potential âgold-standardâ agreement. But Sanders has been unrelenting in his opposition to the TPP and past agreements, which he ardently opposed as a member of the House and Senate.				
					
					
During a week of intense campaigning across Indiana, where polls had suggested Clinton was in the lead, Sanders raised the volume on the trade issue.

âWe must rewrite our disastrous trade policies that enable corporate America to shut down plants in this country and move to Mexico and other low-wage countries,â Sanders declared last Friday, at a United Steelworkers rally outside the Indiana statehouse in Indianapolis. âWe need to end the race to the bottom and enact trade policies that demand that American corporations create jobs here and not abroad.â				
					
					
Since the enactment of NAFTA during former President Bill Clintonâs first term, Sanders noted, Indiana had lost 113,000 manufacturing jobs.				
					
					
âLook around Indiana and you will find once vibrant and strong manufacturing towns like Gary, South Bend, Muncie, Bloomington, Indianapolis and Evansville shattered by abandoned factories, shut down steel mills, sky-high poverty rates and foreclosed homes,â Sanders told a crowd that included members of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at an Indianapolis Carrier Corporation plant that United Technologies has targeted for closure.				
			

							Campaigning across Indiana during the week before the primary, Bernie Sanders raised the volume on the issue.
						
 
More than 1,400 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis will be lost if the company follows through with plans to move operations to Monterey, Mexico, next year. Seven hundred more jobs are expected to be lost in Huntington, Indiana, where United Technologies is preparing to close another facility.				
					
					
A video of the announcement of the planned closing of the Indianapolis furnace plant went viral, and Trump has frequently referenced it in a campaign that has focused a good deal on trade policy. But Local 1999 did not back Trump. Indeed, Carrier workers like Frank Staples dismissed Trump as âa loud-mouthed fraud.â				
					
					
As the primary approached, Local 1999 gave a big endorsement to Sanders.				
					
					
âBernie Sanders for decades has fought against the kinds of disastrous trade deals that are now allowing Carrier to ship over a thousand good-paying Indiana jobs to Mexico,â said Chuck Jones, the steelworkers local president. âBernie Sanders is the only candidate running for president who will do something to stop this kind of corporate greed if he is electedâbecause heâs been fighting against it for years.â

That was a constant theme among union workers who attended the statehouse rally on Friday, and rallies that Sanders held in union towns across Indiana, a industrial state with historically strong United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers locals. (While the national leaders of those major manufacturing unions have not endorsed in the Democratic race, a number of union locals in key statesâsuch as Indianaâs Local 1999âhave backed Sanders.)				
					
					
While national media do a lousy job of covering trade debates, workers in states like Indiana know the issues well. And they know the records of the candidates on those issues.				
					
					
âBernieâs whole career heâs fought for the working class and the middle class,â Carrier assembly-line worker Mark Smith told Politico last month. âHeâs voted on every one of these trade agreements that are stealing these jobs for the American workers. Heâs fought against Wall Street and corporate America. Heâs seen everything thatâs happened to this country, American jobs and workers and how the wealth is being siphoned up to the top.â				
					
					
That understanding of trade policy runs deep in states like Indiana. It counts for more than polls and pundits and what media and political elites have to say about where the Democratic race stands. It may not be sufficient to change the course of the race. But, as part of a broader set of issues that speak to a sense that the economy is âriggedâ against working people, it will keep the Sanders campaign going for a good bit longer.				
					
					
This is one of the reasons why Sanders says that, even if he does not win enough delegates to claim the nomination, he and his supporters will go to Philadelphia to âfight for a progressive party platform that calls forâ¦an end to our disastrous trade policies.â

Bernie Sanders Should Push for a New Realism in Foreign Policy


							“We need to end the race to the bottom...” —Bernie Sanders’s Indiana message
						


On a primary night when media coverage focused obsessively on billionaire Donald Trumpâs âbigâ win in the Indiana Republican primary (a win that formalized his status as the GOPâs presumed nominee), Sanders was running only slightly less well among Democrats than Trump was with Republicans. The Vermonter was carrying the vast majority of Indianaâs counties and winning blue-collar towns that have been battered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, permanent normalization of trade with China, and a host of other global agreements that have undermined workers, communities, the environment and democracy itself.				
					
					
The trade issue was vital for Sanders in Indiana, as it was for him in Michiganâthe state that shook up the race in March by handing the senator a surprise victory over Clinton. Exit polls found that nearly two-thirds of Indiana Democratic primary voters said Wall Street hurts the economy, and 46 percent said free-trade policies costs jobs.				
					
					
Sanders has made his opposition to the trade policies long favored by so many Republican and Democratic party leaders a core tenet of his presidential run from the day he announced his candidacy. During the course of the long battle for the Democratic nomination, Clinton has moved toward a more critical stance on trade issuesâraising objections to the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that she had once talked up as a potential âgold-standardâ agreement. But Sanders has been unrelenting in his opposition to the TPP and past agreements, which he ardently opposed as a member of the House and Senate.				
					
					
During a week of intense campaigning across Indiana, where polls had suggested Clinton was in the lead, Sanders raised the volume on the trade issue.

That was a constant theme among union workers who attended the statehouse rally on Friday, and rallies that Sanders held in union towns across Indiana, a industrial state with historically strong United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers locals. (While the national leaders of those major manufacturing unions have not endorsed in the Democratic race, a number of union locals in key statesâsuch as Indianaâs Local 1999âhave backed Sanders.)

âBernieâs whole career heâs fought for the working class and the middle class,â Carrier assembly-line worker Mark Smith told Politico last month. âHeâs voted on every one of these trade agreements that are stealing these jobs for the American workers. Heâs fought against Wall Street and corporate America. Heâs seen everything thatâs happened to this country, American jobs and workers and how the wealth is being siphoned up to the top.â				
					
					
That understanding of trade policy runs deep in states like Indiana. It counts for more than polls and pundits and what media and political elites have to say about where the Democratic race stands. It may not be sufficient to change the course of the race. But, as part of a broader set of issues that speak to a sense that the economy is âriggedâ against working people, it will keep the Sanders campaign going for a good bit longer.				
					
					
This is one of the reasons why Sanders says that, even if he does not win enough delegates to claim the nomination, he and his supporters will go to Philadelphia to âfight for a progressive party platform that calls forâ¦an end to our disastrous trade policies.â				
					
					
		

âLook around Indiana and you will find once vibrant and strong manufacturing towns like Gary, South Bend, Muncie, Bloomington, Indianapolis and Evansville shattered by abandoned factories, shut down steel mills, sky-high poverty rates and foreclosed homes,â Sanders told a crowd that included members of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at an Indianapolis Carrier Corporation plant that United Technologies has targeted for closure.				
			

							Campaigning across Indiana during the week before the primary, Bernie Sanders raised the volume on the issue.
						
 
More than 1,400 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis will be lost if the company follows through with plans to move operations to Monterey, Mexico, next year. Seven hundred more jobs are expected to be lost in Huntington, Indiana, where United Technologies is preparing to close another facility.				
					
					
A video of the announcement of the planned closing of the Indianapolis furnace plant went viral, and Trump has frequently referenced it in a campaign that has focused a good deal on trade policy. But Local 1999 did not back Trump. Indeed, Carrier workers like Frank Staples dismissed Trump as âa loud-mouthed fraud.â				
					
					
As the primary approached, Local 1999 gave a big endorsement to Sanders.				
					
					
âBernie Sanders for decades has fought against the kinds of disastrous trade deals that are now allowing Carrier to ship over a thousand good-paying Indiana jobs to Mexico,â said Chuck Jones, the steelworkers local president. âBernie Sanders is the only candidate running for president who will do something to stop this kind of corporate greed if he is electedâbecause heâs been fighting against it for years.â

Well stated, all pro-progressive comments. I could not articulate them better. 
I am struck by the number of independents: 42%? Wow. 
It appears that Bernie&apos;s message, like tributaries feeding a river, becomes bigger as time goes on -- and people personally experience his charismatic way of &apos;splaining things which the MSM has carelessly or deliberately failed to feature for a year now.
It will be EW in 2020, as she will inherit the mantle of legacy from Bernie -- no matter who wins in November.  By that time, most presently somnolent or uncaring Americans will be awakened by the sound of rushing water, as the tide rises and the oligarchical elite&apos;s grasping techniques become exposed for what they are: leaky ships anchored to the bottom of the riverbed.
Carry on, sir. You are a monument for otherwise worldly people who yearn for something better.

Many of Bernie&apos;s supporters are long-term Democrats, as I am. Of course we will support the nominee of the party; we see a Republican victory as a disaster the country cannot afford. But Bernie also has a large following of political independents, and I wouldn&apos;t presume to say what they will do if he is not the nominee. As far as I can see, Hillary has not yet produced any excitement among them.

It is so clear that Hillary Clinton just wants Bernie Sanders and his supporters to go away and never be heard from again, so that she can run to the center and build her camp there as fast as she can.   All of the political instincts she has built up over decades tell her that&apos;s where she wants to be.  Unfortunately, this is not the year to be the status quo candidate, but Hillary Clinton still hasn&apos;t figured that out, despite all that has happened in both the Democratic and Republican primaries this year.  I&apos;m afraid Hillary Clinton will end up strangulating the Democratic Party by triangulating its base, just like her husband did 20 years ago.  But I suspect she won&apos;t see this as the losing strategy it is until it is much, much too late.  Of course, if Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in November, it will all be Bernie Sander&apos;s fault (at least according to her and Bill).  In either case, however, the American electorate will get exactly what it deserves.

The punditocracy has totally misread the populace. It happens when one lives in a bubble. Cruz based his entire campaign on the strength of the religious right. They might be religious, but hunger is much more effective at centering one&apos;s attention. Maybe to a lesser degree the same thing applies to Hillary, a Limousine Liberal. She seems to have locked up the DNC, but that will not win the general for her.  Foreign policy credibility means nothing to someone who cannot support his family or live in dignity. The mother of kids who cannot afford higher education will identify as a mother, not as a woman. It&apos;s great that HRC wants to close the gender gap, but that gap exists mostly at the white collar level for people who already have a job. Throughout their existence, unions have never had a gender gap. If you do the work, you get the pay. But Hillary is not known for her support of collective bargaining. Hillary may very well sweep the elites in this election, but she needs a majority.

On September 15, 2015, The Nation published an article by Alfred McCoy: âBarack Obama Is a Foreign Policy Grandmasterâ with subtitle, âThe president has executed a subtle geopolitical strategy with the potential to extend American empire well into the 21st century.â  I found it to be an extraordinary article about Obama&apos;s visionary genius and changed my opinion to a positive one about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  The article was largely about the future of the balance of power in the world.  It also caused me to reflect on a current economic model in the U.S. for blue collar workers that is becoming obsolete but that the opposition candidates to TPP want to perpetuate.  Here&apos;s the link if anyone is interested:  http://www.thenation.com/article/barack-obama-is-a-foreign-policy-grandmaster/

Sanders has brought Nader&apos;s issues forward by several orders of magnitude.  His supporters are not obliged to vote for Clinton.  She risks defeat if she and her supporters dismiss the progressive movement.

Michael,
You have a right to your opinion but you lack real understanding of what is happening in this country. People are angry at a system that empowers an elite few,
where economic struggles continue to grow and where people struggle to survive. The vote in Indiana and in many other states, including upcoming states, reflect that angerâ¦Hillary can become the president but if she  continues the obscene ideas of corporate leaders by maintaining the status quo and entangles us in war you will regret your thinking which is not progressive in any way.

Those that remember 2008 will note that none of Hillary&apos;s policies anchored (or even made it into) the platform after her much closer loss.
In a week or two, when Hillary&apos;s combined delegate count takes her over the needed 2282 delegates, it will a historical moment: America&apos;s first woman nominee from a major party.  Bernie&apos;s moment will be washed away.  She will have earned her chance to shape her platform, lead the party and shape the convention.  The people who love to slur her will deride it as a coronation just as they&apos;ve tried to do throughout the process, but the truth is she worked for every vote and delegate and state she won.  It will be a moment in history and an earned moment at that.  Clowns and misogynists will talk about the women&apos;s card but that will be just bitter nonsense. 
If you want to a support candidates at any level you need to be able to admit the possibility of losing.  Hillary has lost graciously, supported the winning candidate, campaigned for him, served loyally in his administration and then risked another run.  Anything less than such graciousness will stain Sanders and his followers forever.  They will justify their bad behavior with the idea that they are right and deride Hillary supporters as paid shills or low information voters but that is just sour apples and myopia.
You can&apos;t just pretend Bernie is winning when he is 750 or more delegates back.  you don&apos;t dictate the platform from the wrong side of a very lopsided loss and if he can&apos;t show support for the party and nominee he will get shut out of the convention&apos;s speaking slots. The party won&apos;t let another Ted Kennedy chaotic speech disrupt things. If his supporters disrupt the convention they will embarrass themselves and their cause in the eyes of the nation and the world, and help Trump with every utterance.
His fabled independents won&apos;t be there, of course.  Any floor vote they try and force, they will lose just by the numbers: Hillary will be far better represented with 800 more delegates.

I disagree, except to say that Hillary is the best choice for a Republican, and that Trump is certainly going to help her with some voters at the polls (the lesser evil-ism stance for thoughtful Republicans).
  It is the DNC that has consistently "embarrassed itself in (its) cause in the eyes of the nation and the world" by its squalid embrace of neoliberalism and abandonment of all its principles since the New Deal until Clinton I.  One needs to be reminded that the Democrats used to stand for human rights and social justice, at least to some extent, rather than mass incarceration, legitimized torture, assassination by drones, continual war to feed our corporate military beast, etc., etc.,  and that they were suspicious of the whole project of Empire ("We came, we saw, he died...").  They no longer doubt the rightness of any of these things and, as their nation collapses under the weight of their continued foolishness, it is good to have a public voice telling us that there is another way of doing business beyond that adopted by Babylon, Nineveh, Tyre, Rome, the former European great powers, and now the US.  Senator Sanders&apos; presence in the race should be a source of pride for every American who believes in FDR&apos;s suggested second "bill of rights" (in short that human beings should be allowed to live like human beings and not subjects, consumers, conscripts, inmates, or targets).  The DNC is now adopting the posture of cowardice that the MSM had planned all along, with all Trump and Hillary all the time for the last year, but many Citizens (not consumers,  subjects, inmates, conscripts, etc.) do not and will not buy into this shameful false dichotomy.  Even Joe Biden, who knows all the players well, is glad for Bernie&apos;s presence in this race, as every Democrat who wishes to revive the party should be.  Ecrasez l&apos;infame, as on old Leftie once said in a different context.

There&apos;s the rub. If Sanders is not the Democratic Party&apos;s nominee, forcing the DNC (and it will require force) to accept any Progressive policies in their platform will be an exercise in futility. If Sanders is not the nominee, then the nominee will abandon those policies at midnight, November 9, 2016.
