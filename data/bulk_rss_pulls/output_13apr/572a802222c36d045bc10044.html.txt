Donald Trump incorrectly accused Hillary Clinton of being the original source of questions surrounding President Obamaâs eligibility to run for president.

In an interview with CNNÂ on Wednesday, Trump â who is now the presumptive nominee for the Republican PartyÂ â was asked about Clintonâs comments at a NAACP event in Detroit over the weekend that accused him of leading the birther movement.

âThe leading Republican contender is the man who led the insidious birther movement to discredit the presidentâs citizenship,â Clinton said in a clip that CNNâs Wolf Blitzer aired during the interview. âWe cannot let Barack Obamaâs legacy fall into Donald Trumpâs hands.â

âDo you know who started the birther movement?â Trump responded after the clip aired. âDo you know who questioned his birth certificate? One of the first, Hillary Clinton. Sheâs the one that started it, she brought it up years before it was brought up by me.â

But Clinton didn't start it. According to FactCheck.org,Â while some of Clintonâs supporters did question Obamaâs birth certificate âthere is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with it.â
