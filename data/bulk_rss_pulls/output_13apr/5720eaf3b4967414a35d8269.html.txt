Washington (CNN)Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe restored voting rights to more than 200,000 Virginia convicted felons Friday.

STUNNING: @TerryMcAuliffe literally just gave murders and rapists the right to vote in Virginia. https://t.co/X7x8ZBVLD2

Chairman @JohnWhitbeck: "Mercy requires that we as Virginians be a Commonwealth of second chances. But there are limits."

"Blanket restoration, without regard to the nature of the crimes committed, doesn't speak of mercy. It speaks of political opportunism."

.@GovernorVA "VA cannot achieve its full potential until all men and women are eligible for this fundamental right" #VARoR

.@GovernorVA "We will ensure everyone w/ freedom to live in our communities has the right to participate in the democratic process #VARoR
