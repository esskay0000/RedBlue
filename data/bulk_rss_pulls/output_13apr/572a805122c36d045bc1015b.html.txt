âWhat I was doing was referring to a picture reported and in a magazine, and I think they didnât deny it. I donât think anybody denied it.â

â Donald Trump, in an interview with ABCâs âGood Morning America,â May 4, 2016

âI just asked about stories that were appearing all over the place, not just inÂ the National Enquirer, about the fact that a picture was taken of him and Lee Harvey Oswald. They didnât deny that picture.â

â Trump, in an interview with NBCâs âTodayâ show, May 4

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican PartyÂ presidential nominee, refused to apologize for citing a thinly sourced National Enquirer article alleging that Ted Cruzâs father, Rafael, worked with Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. Part of the reason, he said, was because it had not been denied.

The claim was based on a photo image from a half-century ago and the Enquirerâs assertion that it had found two photo analysts who thought a man passing out pro-Cuba leaflets with Oswald looked like Cruzâs father. The man in the photograph has never been identified, but the Warren Commission said he had been hired by Oswald in 1963 to earn a few dollars by passing out pro-Cuba pamphlets. Cruzâs father at the time was vehemently anti-Castro, making him an odd choice for taking suchÂ a job.

Never mind that Cruz himself denounced Trumpâs claim, calling the businessman a âpathological liar.â Never mind that the Cruz campaign dismissed the story as garbage when the Miami Herald published an article on it on April 22 â 11 days before Trump gave it national currency on Fox News.

âThis is another garbage story in a tabloid full of garbage,â Cruzâs communications director, Alice Stewart, told the newspaper. âThe story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture.â

Weâre are puzzled why Trump would not think those are denials. But hereâs a sampling of what other news organizations have said since he made the claim:

Philip Bump, The Washington Post, who happens to be our in-houseÂ Kennedy assassination buff:

Weâre asked to believe, then, that Oswald ran into a Rafael Cruz at an employment office in a city where Cruz may not have been living. That Cruz then agreed to join Oswald in passing out flyers, despite their advocating a position that Cruz himself vehemently opposed. That he may or may not have been photographed doing so â and that a witness at the scene thought the other guy passing out flyers was a lot taller than Cruz.

PolitiFact, giving a Pants on Fire rating:

The sole âevidenceâ for this claim is a grainy photograph that shows Oswald with a man who may bear a resemblance to Cruz. But experts tell PolitiFact that the image is too degraded to offer much confidence. At the same time, multiple experts about the world of early 1960s pro-Castro advocacy said they have never seen evidence of Cruz associating with Oswald and consider Trumpâs claim implausible at best and ridiculous at worst.

FactCheck.Org, saying it was a baseless claim:

Trump used a thinly sourced story from the tabloidÂ National EnquirerÂ to make the baseless claim that Ted Cruzâs father âwas with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswaldâs being â you know, shot.â

TheÂ National EnquirerÂ story hangs largely on comments from a photo expert who said a photo of an unidentified man handing out pro-Fidel Castro leaflets with Oswald has âmore similarity than dissimilarityâ withÂ a passport photo of Cruzâs father, Rafael.

But that same expert told us in a phone interview that he never claimed the man in the picture with Oswald was definitely Rafael Cruz, only that comparing the man in the photo with a photo of Cruz as a young man revealed âmore similarities than dissimilarities.â In fact, he called Trumpâs definitive proclamation âstupid.â

Jake Tapper, reporting on CNN:

I cannot believe I need to say the following, but here goes. There is no corroborated evidence that Ted Cruzâs father ever met Lee HarveyÂ Oswald, or, for that matter, any other presidential assassin.

We in the media donât talk about it because thereâs no evidence of it. In fact, there is contrary evidence. Well before the picture was taken, Rafael Cruzâs sister was brutally beaten by Castro forces and Rafael Cruz had denounced the regime.

So, any suggestion that Cruzâs father played a role in the Kennedy assassination is ridiculous and, frankly, shameful. Now, thatâs not an anti-TrumpÂ position or a pro-Cruz position. Itâs a pro-truth position.

Trump is once again making a ridiculous claim. The story he touted was denied in print â and then repeatedly debunked. By claiming that it was not denied, he continues to suggest there is some possible truth to a claim that is flat-out false.
