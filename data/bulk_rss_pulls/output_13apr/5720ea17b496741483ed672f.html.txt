WASHINGTON –  The Supreme Court seems likely to overturn the conviction of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell on political corruption charges and place new limits on the reach of federal bribery laws.

Several justices on Wednesday expressed major concerns that the laws give prosecutors too much power to criminalize the everyday acts that politician perform to help constituents.

Chief Justice John Roberts said it was "extraordinary" that dozens of former White House attorneys from both parties have said upholding McDonnell's conviction would cripple the ability of elected officials to do their jobs.

Justice Breyer said the law presents "a real separation of powers problem."

McDonnell was convicted of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from a wealthy businessman in exchange for promoting a dietary supplement.
