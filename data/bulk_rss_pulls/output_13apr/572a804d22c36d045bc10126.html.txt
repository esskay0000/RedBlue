Indianapolis (CNN)South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is predicting "another 9/11" if Donald Trump is elected president. 

I watched Sen. Graham @FaceTheNation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support?

If the WSJ poll in Indiana is accurate, not only is the primary process over, the GOP is too.

True, the GOP will actually survive, but it's going to be a brutal two years. The state parties will be the saving grace of the GOP.
