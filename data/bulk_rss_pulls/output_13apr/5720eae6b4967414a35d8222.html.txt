Last week, I attempted to debunk allegations of widespread election fraud by the Clinton campaign that have been swirling around on social media. My argument was an appeal to common sense: If Hillary Clinton entered the race with a very large lead in the national polls and an enormous amount of support from Democratic Party activists and elected officials, as she did, and then quickly built up a significant lead in pledged delegates, as she did, then at no time since the start of the race, regardless of how unscrupulous her campaign might be, would there be any rational motive for risking infamy by rigging the vote. You donât need to cheat when youâre winning.

That didnât sit well with Harvey Wasserman and Bob Fitrakis, whose earlier piece for The Free Press, âIs the 2016 election already being stripped & flipped?,â I had mentioned briefly in the column. Theyâve now published a lengthy broadside accusing me, and The Nation, of not being able to handle the truth when it comes to âelection theft.â (Itâs an odd charge, given that my Nation colleague Ari Berman has done some of the best reporting in the country on vote suppression.)		
Itâs unfortunate that Wasserman and Fitrakis didnât engage my argument (or link to my piece so that readers might judge it for themselves). Instead, they waved away the idea that looking at motive is a legitimate way of evaluating the likelihood that a crime has been committed, writing that the argument was âa bit hard to follow.â		
Of the 2016 election, they write that millions of Democratic voters have âalready been stripped from the voter rolls in critical states like Ohio.â They noted that most votes Americans will cast this year will be tallied on electronic voting machines that have no auditable paper trail. And they claim that primary exit polls offer evidence that Bernie Sanders is âdoing far better than the official vote count.â		
But how well do these claims support the charge that the primaries are being rigged? Without getting too deep into the weeds, whatâs clear is that Fitrakis and Wasserman donât require much in the way of evidence to allege that an election is being stolen.		
An example: In their original piece, they claimed that in Iowa, âClintonâs âvictoryâ apparently turned on six coin tosses, all of which she allegedly won.â That would have been odd. But, as I wrote to Wasserman via e-mail on April 3, this was an early report that had later been proven erroneous by CNN, NPR and The Atlantic, among others. Thereâs no complete record of the ties that were decided by a coin flip in Iowa, but two things are clear: Sanders won his share, and since each flip determined only a tiny fraction of a single delegate, they had zero impact on the outcome. But as of this writing, their post remains uncorrected.

Another: Fitrakis and Wasserman claim that âthereâs clear evidence that Bernie actually won the Massachusetts primary, which the corporate media and official vote count gave to Hillary.â They write that polls in Massachusetts showed âBernie substantially ahead of Clinton prior to the voting,â but FiveThirtyEightâs weighted polling average on the eve of the primary had Clinton up by double digits and gave her a 94 percent chance of winning. Given that Clinton won in a squeaker, it was actually Sanders who did better than the polls predicted.		
They go on to cite an analysis by Richard Charnin, who writes a blog devoted to âJFK conspiracy and systemic election fraud analysis,â claiming that, as Fitrakis and Wasserman put it, âBernie won all the precincts with hand-counted paper ballots but lost all the ones with electronic voting machines.â The implication is clear, but the problem is that, even if Charninâs numbers are accurate, the vast majority of precincts in Massachusetts use optical scanners. So we run into a small sample problem, and a result thatâs easily explained by Sandersâs faring better than Clinton in small, rural towns that hand-count their votes.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman have done some important work. Their research into irregularities during the 2004 election in Ohio revealed problems that were largely overlooked by the mainstream media. Theyâve worked hard to bring attention to a variety of problems plaguing our election systems. And Wasserman has played a key role in the âno nukesâ movement going back to the 1970s.		
But when Mark Hertsgaard went back and did some original reporting for Mother Jones, he found that a number of their central claims about Ohio didnât hold up. Hertsgaard came away convinced that âthere was indeed something rotten in the state of Ohio in 2004,â but noted that âit remains far from clear that Bush stole the election,â in large part because âsome of the most far-reaching acts of potential disenfranchisement, such as the purging of voter rolls, were legal.â Hertsgaard added that âthe focus on vote rigging distracts from other explanations for the 2004 outcome.â		
And since then, Fitrakis and Wasserman have continued to reprise the same story. They predicted that the 2008 and 2012 elections were being rigged, and are now warning that the same thing, using the same methods, is now occurring in 2016âin the primaries, as well as the general.

Steve Rosenfeld, Wasserman and Fitrakisâs co-author of the 2006 book What Happened in Ohio: A Documentary Record of Theft And Fraud in the 2004 Election, told me that while the pair âhave done some important reporting, they undermine their brand by being unnecessarily sensational about stuff that later proves to be irrelevant.â He described them as members of a small community of lefty journalists who get lots of traffic by âmaking outrageous claims about voting scares.â		
Rosenfeld notes that in 2008 their book was used by the Obama campaign to design its successful election-protection strategy in Ohio, which included tracking which companies programmed voting machines so any problems could be quickly quarantined. He explained that purging inactive voters is a routine matter of voter-roll housekeeping that isnât evidence of wrongdoing. Voter purges have been abused in the pastânotably by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris prior to the 2000 electionâbut they now get a lot more scrutiny in the wake of that debacle. âJust because something was true in 2000 or 2004 doesnât mean itâs going to be a problem in 2016,â Rosenfeld said. (Ari Berman argued in The Nation that the attention on Harrisâs purge gave rise to a new wave of Republican efforts to suppress the Democratic vote by passing new ID laws, restricting voting hours, and limiting polling places.)		
Rosenfeld is quick to point out that Fitrakis and Wasserman are right that electronic voting machines donât offer an auditable paper trail. But he says the larger issue is that elections are underfunded, and we rely on antiquated equipment thatâs often poorly calibrated. Asked about Fitrakis and Wassermanâs claim that âGOP governors and secretaries of state will have a free hand to flip the vote count to whatever they want it to be without detection or accountability,â Rosenfeld said, âThere are just too many stretches embedded in that assertion. People are going to be watching the vote count, however imperfectly, at every stage along the way, and it wonât allow for that kind of wholesale theft to go unnoticed.â		
Thereâs no doubt that our fractured election system is a disgrace. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of New Yorkers found that their voter registrations had been botched or disappeared. Others were surprised to find that the deadline to switch party registration in the Empire State, which has closed primaries, was way back in October, long before most people started paying attention to the campaign. But those who believe these problems are prima facie evidence of foul playâa belief that seemed widespread on social media Tuesday nightâare misinformed. Thereâs nothing new about New Yorkâs electionsâ being a total mess. Back in 2012, Michael Powell reported for The New York Times that during the 2010 campaign the Board of Elections disqualified 40 percent of the vote in two Bronx precincts and âsent out an absentee ballot instructing voters to fill out the bubble above the name of the candidate they favored, instead of below it.â During the 2012 primary, the boardâs initial count recorded no vote counts in 79 of the 13th Districtâs 506 precincts. âThe boardâs incompetence,â wrote Powell, âis well established.â He cited reports of poor election administration dating back to the mid-1980s. And the deadline for switching parties was enacted in the late 1800s.		
In 2004, the late scholar Robert Pastor, who had worked as an international elections monitor in emerging democracies for the Carter Center, wrote about 10 different metrics that his team had used to evaluate the strength of countriesâ election processes. âOn all 10 dimensions of election administration,â he wrote, âthe United States scores near the bottom of electoral democracies.â¦ We have been sloppy and have not insisted that our voting machines be as free from error as our washing machines.â¦ we lack uniform standards, andâ¦have devolved authority to the lowest, poorest level of government.â Twelve years later, and 16 years after the debacle in Florida, those structural realities havenât changed. If anything, itâs gotten worse, as a slew of Republican legislatures have passed restrictive voting laws designed to disenfranchise voting blocs that tend to skew toward Democrats. A study by researchers at the University of CaliforniaâSan Diego released earlier this year confirmed what everyone already knew: In states with strict voter-ID laws, Democratic turnout drops by 7.7 percentage points and Republican turnout drops by only 4.6 points.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman join these very serious problems with innuendo and thin evidence to claim that virtually all elections, including the 2016 primaries, are rigged. They dismiss those of us who donât buy their claims as being incapable of handling the truth. But skepticism goes both ways, and true skeptics require more concrete evidence than Fitrakis and Wasserman are able to offer.

Another: Fitrakis and Wasserman claim that âthereâs clear evidence that Bernie actually won the Massachusetts primary, which the corporate media and official vote count gave to Hillary.â They write that polls in Massachusetts showed âBernie substantially ahead of Clinton prior to the voting,â but FiveThirtyEightâs weighted polling average on the eve of the primary had Clinton up by double digits and gave her a 94 percent chance of winning. Given that Clinton won in a squeaker, it was actually Sanders who did better than the polls predicted.		
They go on to cite an analysis by Richard Charnin, who writes a blog devoted to âJFK conspiracy and systemic election fraud analysis,â claiming that, as Fitrakis and Wasserman put it, âBernie won all the precincts with hand-counted paper ballots but lost all the ones with electronic voting machines.â The implication is clear, but the problem is that, even if Charninâs numbers are accurate, the vast majority of precincts in Massachusetts use optical scanners. So we run into a small sample problem, and a result thatâs easily explained by Sandersâs faring better than Clinton in small, rural towns that hand-count their votes.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman have done some important work. Their research into irregularities during the 2004 election in Ohio revealed problems that were largely overlooked by the mainstream media. Theyâve worked hard to bring attention to a variety of problems plaguing our election systems. And Wasserman has played a key role in the âno nukesâ movement going back to the 1970s.		
But when Mark Hertsgaard went back and did some original reporting for Mother Jones, he found that a number of their central claims about Ohio didnât hold up. Hertsgaard came away convinced that âthere was indeed something rotten in the state of Ohio in 2004,â but noted that âit remains far from clear that Bush stole the election,â in large part because âsome of the most far-reaching acts of potential disenfranchisement, such as the purging of voter rolls, were legal.â Hertsgaard added that âthe focus on vote rigging distracts from other explanations for the 2004 outcome.â		
And since then, Fitrakis and Wasserman have continued to reprise the same story. They predicted that the 2008 and 2012 elections were being rigged, and are now warning that the same thing, using the same methods, is now occurring in 2016âin the primaries, as well as the general.

Steve Rosenfeld, Wasserman and Fitrakisâs co-author of the 2006 book What Happened in Ohio: A Documentary Record of Theft And Fraud in the 2004 Election, told me that while the pair âhave done some important reporting, they undermine their brand by being unnecessarily sensational about stuff that later proves to be irrelevant.â He described them as members of a small community of lefty journalists who get lots of traffic by âmaking outrageous claims about voting scares.â		
Rosenfeld notes that in 2008 their book was used by the Obama campaign to design its successful election-protection strategy in Ohio, which included tracking which companies programmed voting machines so any problems could be quickly quarantined. He explained that purging inactive voters is a routine matter of voter-roll housekeeping that isnât evidence of wrongdoing. Voter purges have been abused in the pastânotably by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris prior to the 2000 electionâbut they now get a lot more scrutiny in the wake of that debacle. âJust because something was true in 2000 or 2004 doesnât mean itâs going to be a problem in 2016,â Rosenfeld said. (Ari Berman argued in The Nation that the attention on Harrisâs purge gave rise to a new wave of Republican efforts to suppress the Democratic vote by passing new ID laws, restricting voting hours, and limiting polling places.)		
Rosenfeld is quick to point out that Fitrakis and Wasserman are right that electronic voting machines donât offer an auditable paper trail. But he says the larger issue is that elections are underfunded, and we rely on antiquated equipment thatâs often poorly calibrated. Asked about Fitrakis and Wassermanâs claim that âGOP governors and secretaries of state will have a free hand to flip the vote count to whatever they want it to be without detection or accountability,â Rosenfeld said, âThere are just too many stretches embedded in that assertion. People are going to be watching the vote count, however imperfectly, at every stage along the way, and it wonât allow for that kind of wholesale theft to go unnoticed.â		
Thereâs no doubt that our fractured election system is a disgrace. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of New Yorkers found that their voter registrations had been botched or disappeared. Others were surprised to find that the deadline to switch party registration in the Empire State, which has closed primaries, was way back in October, long before most people started paying attention to the campaign. But those who believe these problems are prima facie evidence of foul playâa belief that seemed widespread on social media Tuesday nightâare misinformed. Thereâs nothing new about New Yorkâs electionsâ being a total mess. Back in 2012, Michael Powell reported for The New York Times that during the 2010 campaign the Board of Elections disqualified 40 percent of the vote in two Bronx precincts and âsent out an absentee ballot instructing voters to fill out the bubble above the name of the candidate they favored, instead of below it.â During the 2012 primary, the boardâs initial count recorded no vote counts in 79 of the 13th Districtâs 506 precincts. âThe boardâs incompetence,â wrote Powell, âis well established.â He cited reports of poor election administration dating back to the mid-1980s. And the deadline for switching parties was enacted in the late 1800s.		
In 2004, the late scholar Robert Pastor, who had worked as an international elections monitor in emerging democracies for the Carter Center, wrote about 10 different metrics that his team had used to evaluate the strength of countriesâ election processes. âOn all 10 dimensions of election administration,â he wrote, âthe United States scores near the bottom of electoral democracies.â¦ We have been sloppy and have not insisted that our voting machines be as free from error as our washing machines.â¦ we lack uniform standards, andâ¦have devolved authority to the lowest, poorest level of government.â Twelve years later, and 16 years after the debacle in Florida, those structural realities havenât changed. If anything, itâs gotten worse, as a slew of Republican legislatures have passed restrictive voting laws designed to disenfranchise voting blocs that tend to skew toward Democrats. A study by researchers at the University of CaliforniaâSan Diego released earlier this year confirmed what everyone already knew: In states with strict voter-ID laws, Democratic turnout drops by 7.7 percentage points and Republican turnout drops by only 4.6 points.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman join these very serious problems with innuendo and thin evidence to claim that virtually all elections, including the 2016 primaries, are rigged. They dismiss those of us who donât buy their claims as being incapable of handling the truth. But skepticism goes both ways, and true skeptics require more concrete evidence than Fitrakis and Wasserman are able to offer.		
		

But how well do these claims support the charge that the primaries are being rigged? Without getting too deep into the weeds, whatâs clear is that Fitrakis and Wasserman donât require much in the way of evidence to allege that an election is being stolen.		
An example: In their original piece, they claimed that in Iowa, âClintonâs âvictoryâ apparently turned on six coin tosses, all of which she allegedly won.â That would have been odd. But, as I wrote to Wasserman via e-mail on April 3, this was an early report that had later been proven erroneous by CNN, NPR and The Atlantic, among others. Thereâs no complete record of the ties that were decided by a coin flip in Iowa, but two things are clear: Sanders won his share, and since each flip determined only a tiny fraction of a single delegate, they had zero impact on the outcome. But as of this writing, their post remains uncorrected.

Back in 2012, Michael Powell reported for The New York Times that during the 2010 campaign the Board of Elections disqualified 40 percent of the vote in two Bronx precincts and âsent out an absentee ballot instructing voters to fill out the bubble above the name of the candidate they favored, instead of below it.â During the 2012 primary, the boardâs initial count recorded no vote counts in 79 of the 13th Districtâs 506 precincts. âThe boardâs incompetence,â wrote Powell, âis well established.â He cited reports of poor election administration dating back to the mid-1980s. And the deadline for switching parties was enacted in the late 1800s.		
In 2004, the late scholar Robert Pastor, who had worked as an international elections monitor in emerging democracies for the Carter Center, wrote about 10 different metrics that his team had used to evaluate the strength of countriesâ election processes. âOn all 10 dimensions of election administration,â he wrote, âthe United States scores near the bottom of electoral democracies.â¦ We have been sloppy and have not insisted that our voting machines be as free from error as our washing machines.â¦ we lack uniform standards, andâ¦have devolved authority to the lowest, poorest level of government.â Twelve years later, and 16 years after the debacle in Florida, those structural realities havenât changed. If anything, itâs gotten worse, as a slew of Republican legislatures have passed restrictive voting laws designed to disenfranchise voting blocs that tend to skew toward Democrats. A study by researchers at the University of CaliforniaâSan Diego released earlier this year confirmed what everyone already knew: In states with strict voter-ID laws, Democratic turnout drops by 7.7 percentage points and Republican turnout drops by only 4.6 points.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman join these very serious problems with innuendo and thin evidence to claim that virtually all elections, including the 2016 primaries, are rigged. They dismiss those of us who donât buy their claims as being incapable of handling the truth. But skepticism goes both ways, and true skeptics require more concrete evidence than Fitrakis and Wasserman are able to offer.		
		

They go on to cite an analysis by Richard Charnin, who writes a blog devoted to âJFK conspiracy and systemic election fraud analysis,â claiming that, as Fitrakis and Wasserman put it, âBernie won all the precincts with hand-counted paper ballots but lost all the ones with electronic voting machines.â The implication is clear, but the problem is that, even if Charninâs numbers are accurate, the vast majority of precincts in Massachusetts use optical scanners. So we run into a small sample problem, and a result thatâs easily explained by Sandersâs faring better than Clinton in small, rural towns that hand-count their votes.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman have done some important work. Their research into irregularities during the 2004 election in Ohio revealed problems that were largely overlooked by the mainstream media. Theyâve worked hard to bring attention to a variety of problems plaguing our election systems. And Wasserman has played a key role in the âno nukesâ movement going back to the 1970s.		
But when Mark Hertsgaard went back and did some original reporting for Mother Jones, he found that a number of their central claims about Ohio didnât hold up. Hertsgaard came away convinced that âthere was indeed something rotten in the state of Ohio in 2004,â but noted that âit remains far from clear that Bush stole the election,â in large part because âsome of the most far-reaching acts of potential disenfranchisement, such as the purging of voter rolls, were legal.â Hertsgaard added that âthe focus on vote rigging distracts from other explanations for the 2004 outcome.â		
And since then, Fitrakis and Wasserman have continued to reprise the same story. They predicted that the 2008 and 2012 elections were being rigged, and are now warning that the same thing, using the same methods, is now occurring in 2016âin the primaries, as well as the general.

Steve Rosenfeld, Wasserman and Fitrakisâs co-author of the 2006 book What Happened in Ohio: A Documentary Record of Theft And Fraud in the 2004 Election, told me that while the pair âhave done some important reporting, they undermine their brand by being unnecessarily sensational about stuff that later proves to be irrelevant.â He described them as members of a small community of lefty journalists who get lots of traffic by âmaking outrageous claims about voting scares.â		
Rosenfeld notes that in 2008 their book was used by the Obama campaign to design its successful election-protection strategy in Ohio, which included tracking which companies programmed voting machines so any problems could be quickly quarantined. He explained that purging inactive voters is a routine matter of voter-roll housekeeping that isnât evidence of wrongdoing. Voter purges have been abused in the pastânotably by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris prior to the 2000 electionâbut they now get a lot more scrutiny in the wake of that debacle. âJust because something was true in 2000 or 2004 doesnât mean itâs going to be a problem in 2016,â Rosenfeld said. (Ari Berman argued in The Nation that the attention on Harrisâs purge gave rise to a new wave of Republican efforts to suppress the Democratic vote by passing new ID laws, restricting voting hours, and limiting polling places.)		
Rosenfeld is quick to point out that Fitrakis and Wasserman are right that electronic voting machines donât offer an auditable paper trail. But he says the larger issue is that elections are underfunded, and we rely on antiquated equipment thatâs often poorly calibrated. Asked about Fitrakis and Wassermanâs claim that âGOP governors and secretaries of state will have a free hand to flip the vote count to whatever they want it to be without detection or accountability,â Rosenfeld said, âThere are just too many stretches embedded in that assertion. People are going to be watching the vote count, however imperfectly, at every stage along the way, and it wonât allow for that kind of wholesale theft to go unnoticed.â		
Thereâs no doubt that our fractured election system is a disgrace. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of New Yorkers found that their voter registrations had been botched or disappeared. Others were surprised to find that the deadline to switch party registration in the Empire State, which has closed primaries, was way back in October, long before most people started paying attention to the campaign.

If anything, itâs gotten worse, as a slew of Republican legislatures have passed restrictive voting laws designed to disenfranchise voting blocs that tend to skew toward Democrats. A study by researchers at the University of CaliforniaâSan Diego released earlier this year confirmed what everyone already knew: In states with strict voter-ID laws, Democratic turnout drops by 7.7 percentage points and Republican turnout drops by only 4.6 points.		
Fitrakis and Wasserman join these very serious problems with innuendo and thin evidence to claim that virtually all elections, including the 2016 primaries, are rigged. They dismiss those of us who donât buy their claims as being incapable of handling the truth. But skepticism goes both ways, and true skeptics require more concrete evidence than Fitrakis and Wasserman are able to offer.		
		

Rosenfeld notes that in 2008 their book was used by the Obama campaign to design its successful election-protection strategy in Ohio, which included tracking which companies programmed voting machines so any problems could be quickly quarantined. He explained that purging inactive voters is a routine matter of voter-roll housekeeping that isnât evidence of wrongdoing. Voter purges have been abused in the pastânotably by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris prior to the 2000 electionâbut they now get a lot more scrutiny in the wake of that debacle. âJust because something was true in 2000 or 2004 doesnât mean itâs going to be a problem in 2016,â Rosenfeld said. (Ari Berman argued in The Nation that the attention on Harrisâs purge gave rise to a new wave of Republican efforts to suppress the Democratic vote by passing new ID laws, restricting voting hours, and limiting polling places.)		
Rosenfeld is quick to point out that Fitrakis and Wasserman are right that electronic voting machines donât offer an auditable paper trail. But he says the larger issue is that elections are underfunded, and we rely on antiquated equipment thatâs often poorly calibrated. Asked about Fitrakis and Wassermanâs claim that âGOP governors and secretaries of state will have a free hand to flip the vote count to whatever they want it to be without detection or accountability,â Rosenfeld said, âThere are just too many stretches embedded in that assertion. People are going to be watching the vote count, however imperfectly, at every stage along the way, and it wonât allow for that kind of wholesale theft to go unnoticed.â		
Thereâs no doubt that our fractured election system is a disgrace. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of New Yorkers found that their voter registrations had been botched or disappeared. Others were surprised to find that the deadline to switch party registration in the Empire State, which has closed primaries, was way back in October, long before most people started paying attention to the campaign. But those who believe these problems are prima facie evidence of foul playâa belief that seemed widespread on social media Tuesday nightâare misinformed. Thereâs nothing new about New Yorkâs electionsâ being a total mess. Back in 2012, Michael Powell reported for The New York Times that during the 2010 campaign the Board of Elections disqualified 40 percent of the vote in two Bronx precincts and âsent out an absentee ballot instructing voters to fill out the bubble above the name of the candidate they favored, instead of below it.â During the 2012 primary, the boardâs initial count recorded no vote counts in 79 of the 13th Districtâs 506 precincts. âThe boardâs incompetence,â wrote Powell, âis well established.â He cited reports of poor election administration dating back to the mid-1980s. And the deadline for switching parties was enacted in the late 1800s.

The first problem in this article is in the assumptions made in the first paragraph, summed up nicely by: "You donât need to cheat when youâre winning."
You&apos;re assuming that the Clinton campaign is legitimately winning, and therefore that they&apos;re not cheating, in order to make the dependent assumption: that they don&apos;t need to cheat. Totally circular logic.

Now I see another Nation story, "African Americans Have a Good Reason to Support Hillary Clinton." This subscriber is very disappointed to conclude that The Nation is in the tank for Hillary.

As a Nation subscriber, I&apos;m disappointed that they gave this story to a reporter who hasn&apos;t educated himself on the issue. Mr. Holland, please read Richard Charnin&apos;s Matrix of Deceit and Jonathan Simon&apos;s Code Red: Computerized Election Theft and the New American Century, for starters. Don&apos;t turn a blind eye, like the vast majority of your colleagues.

Mr. Holland&apos;s comment re Clintonian existential needs, "You don&apos;t need to cheat when you&apos;re winning",seems rather chicken-and-eggish to me. I rather doubt that political machinistas even realize that there is a semantic difference between cheating and winning and even if they vaguely do, all they really need to know is that their future as machinistas depends on delivering what they are supposed to deliver. Anyway, how else are they going to maintain their machinista skill set in well oiled condition if they don&apos;t cheat and win and win and cheat every single chance they get? Just because we find their behavior loathesome doesn&apos;t mean that they do.

Also, could you explain how Richard Charnin&apos;s analysis is faulty in his April 23 post on the NY primary vote and exit polls (https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com), which he summed up as: "There were 1307 NY exit poll respondents at 9 pm and 1391 at the final â an increase of just 84 respondents.  Adjustments made to force the final 1391 exit poll to match the recorded vote in all exit poll categories are mathematically impossible. Therefore, the recorded vote was also mathematically impossible. The impossible adjustments are irrefutable proof of election fraud."

There is also this very interesting discussion on google groups by experts on the subject including Theodore Soares, with copies of the CNN exit polls. https://groups.google.com/forum/?
hl=en#!msg/ElectionIntegrity/rVGPMlqAAHo/KuNCUXyOCQAJ

Thank you for this link, Carolyn. At least outside of The Nation&apos;s pages someone is investigating the obvious theft of the NY primary. Well done, Mr. Charmin -- and well done, you, for throwing down the gauntlet before Mr. Holland... and increasing the visibility of Charmin&apos;s important piece.

Did I miss the author&apos;s reply to the comment by Alexandra Skwara below?  "...any deviation of more than 3% from exit polls should lead to an automatic audit of the voting results and a manual recount if necessary. Unlike pre-election polls, which often prove wrong, representatively conducted exit polls are considered the international gold standard election monitors, with deviations from them taken as serious indications of electoral fraud."

That many outrageous irregularities occurred during this election cycle does not mean that Hillary Clinton&apos;s campaign ,or others working on her behalf conspired to rig the election.  Holland&apos;s thesis is sound.  His basic premise is that at no point in the national race has Hillary Clinton been ahead by fewer than 9 points in the 538 weighted polling average.  That&apos;s a very large and robust lead that, despite my repeated prayers,  simply has not vanished.  

The unfortunate truth is that Clinton was able, in primary after primary, to rack up overwhelming vote margins from African Americans, older voters, wealthier voters, and in most cases, women.   Sanders was able to make a major surge with younger voters, working class whites, men, and very progressive voters-especially in open elections and in very progressive states like Vermont, Washington, and (I&apos;m sure) Oregon.    

Unfortunately,  arithmetic was not on his side.  There are just more wealthy, African American, women and older voters- especially in closed primaries--then there are are younger, working class white (especially rural,) progressive voters, and Sanders wasn&apos;t able to make enough inroads with the demographic groups that favored Clinton heavily to catch up.

If the Clinton campaign cheats when they win, how is it there no howls of them cheating when Sanders wins by lopsided margins in some states. The claim that Clinton cheats when she wins and doesn&apos;t when she loses seems a little facile unless you believe that in an untarnished primary, that every state would go for Sanders 75%-25%. I realize that there ARE some who believe that, and many more who would like to believe that. But, like Gershwin put it so succinctly, "It Ain&apos;t Necessarily So."

Several points.  What about the disappearance of unadjusted exit poll results which disappear from public view if they disagree from real voting results.  IN other  countries, the discrepancy between the  exit polls and final voting results is used as a red flag indicating election fraud.  Not here.  The discrepancy is blamed on inaccurate exit poll sampling.  Well, maybe, but why is fraud never mentioned as a possibility?  Supposedly the samplers are capable samplers.  And it used to be the news media each had their own exit polls.  NOw they all got together and just have one without checks from other news organizations.  
SEcond, just because the votes are rigged, doesn&apos;t mean Hillary&apos;s campaign is to blame.  There are a number of groups with motive to rig in her favor:  the banks, the CIA, the pentagon, the pharmaceutical companies, I a sure there are others.  Electronic voting is way too vulnerable to hacking.  As are voter rolls.

Two points. First, I&apos;ve been asking people who cite unadjusted exit polls to offer me a link or reliable source, and they never do, because as far as I understand, pollsters never release their unadjusted data. Second, there&apos;s an irony here: Pollsters adjust their samples to be consistent with the demographics of the population they&apos;re polling. Which means that the unadjusted results are less accurate than the adjusted ones. If you know a population is 20% black, and your sample comes up with 5% African-Americans, that&apos;s not going to be representative.

Oh come ON, Joshua, the evidence is clear and growing. Get your head out of the sand. Of course there&apos;s a reason to cheat even if you&apos;re ahead ... to prevent an insurgency from taking the lead away!  Your "logic" is illogical. After losing once, Hillary is dead set on not losing again, *whatever* it takes. For you not to acknowledge the malfeasance that&apos;s been going on all over the country is utterly disingenuous. http://ktar.com/story/1029529/allegations-of-voter-fraud-follow-hillary-clinton-campaign-across-nation/ https://34justice.com/2016/04/22/the-new-york-primary-was-a-shtshow-heres-why/

And here&apos;s another excellent story from KTAR yesterday: http://ktar.com/story/1036396/arizona-poll-worker-testifies-incorrect-ballots-given-to-democratic-voters/

Holland wrote a title (what you see pop up with a google search) and article which appears to be much like the kind of writing I have seen with the Washington Post, CNN, New York Times and others. I think there is plenty of evidence that has been popping up all over the country. WE are not afraid of the truth Holland, something is not right with this election. I am close to canceling my Nation subscription as well.

How is it that maintaining voting rolls in NYC during the year before a primary and presidential election suddenly looks like cheating or ill-willed to bernie supporters?  They sent out the post cards we all get to check our registration and folks did not return those cards, after not voting in two national cycles (eight years)?  Or the cards sent to the address given returned undeliverable?  How is that a surprise in a city full of renters and sub-letters?   You don&apos;t get to use old addresses to maintain your registration anywhere in this country, right?  Where you vote is determined by residency, right?  
There is also this agonizing issue of whether each state democratic party lets non-democrats vote in their primaries:  one understands the argument for either letting them or not letting them.  Primaries are meant to get voters excited and to attract people to the party in addition to letting members of the party help pick the nominee.  I see no good reason to let republicans cross over or let independents vote in a democratic party&apos;s primary but I know the other argument appeals to people too.  Those who argue it is undemocratic should try and go vote for the academy awards or any other organization&apos;s voting.  
Expecting exit polls to and telephone polls and internet polls to match actual voting is pretty silly too, as all those kinds of polling involve sampling and decisions about the shape and size and accuracy of samples taken.  Voting is the thing: there is nothing like it.

Thou protesteth too much, leaving me feeling that where there is smoke there is actually fire

I remember seeing a similar argument posed in the early 70s:

âIf Richard Nixon entered the race with a very large lead in the national polls and an enormous amount of support from Republican Party activists and elected officials, as he did â¦  then at no time since the start of the race, regardless of how unscrupulous his campaign might be, would there be any rational motive for risking infamy by breaking into the DNC headquarters at Watergate. You donât need to cheat when youâre winning."

While I share your skepticism of the widespread "vote rigging" allegations that seem to circulate and recirculate among the pro-Sanders social media sites, I think the best arguments are to made based on clear evidence - not "motive". The "motive" argument you have posed here resembles what is often posed against charges of rape against men who are known womanisers and/or particular wealthy/powerful/attractive, eg "he could &apos;have&apos; any woman, so why would he &apos;need&apos; to rape a woman?" (remember DSK?). Meanwhile, the truth about "motives" is always rather more complex. In rape, questions of power, rather than mere access to sex, are paramount. Similarly in elections - despite being set up in many ways from the outset as the "frontrunner", HRC has rather a lot at stake in this contest, not to mention a certain degree of &apos;power&apos; she both needs to protect (at all costs?), and has some ability to exert to ensure things turn out the way she wants. This does not by any means serve to substantiate or defeat the allegations of "vote rigging" - but it certainly raises questions about the value of arguing the case based on "the (lack of) motive of (the winning player) to commit x,y,z act".

Comparing the motive for vote rigging to the dynamics and power relationships involved in rape is very offensive and tone-death particularly when this election involves a woman candidate.
The real reason for these beliefs in Bernie-land is an inability of many Bernie voters to believe that so many millions of democratic voters do not see this candidate -Hillary- the way they do.  They have a complete inability to understand why a voter like me -far to the left all my life- would ever fail to see the superiority of Bernie and his positions.   They argue that Hillary supporters are heart-less or that she is heart-less, that we and she are hawks or &apos;corporate whores&apos; (as Paul Song so crazily and hurtfully said in NYC last week).  They assume anyone writing on behalf of Hillary is a republican troll or has been hired by Hillary&apos;s campaign to do so.  
Such lack of understanding and empathy and perspective taking is sad indeed.

I am a woman. I have been raped. I in no way find the example used offensive. What I do find offensive is the knee jerk over dependence on allegations of sexism that have marked this primary election cycle.

You assume a lot, judging people from your own perspective.  Young people see clearly, but older active progressives, like myself have been following Bernie for years/decades, and watching Hillary too.   We love Bernie because he&apos;s the real deal, and Hillary is the same old political machine, only she has mastered that art.  I won&apos;t try to get into your head or try to analyze the typical Hillary fan, as you think you can analyze Bernie disciples.  All I can say, is if you cannot see it, no one can make you see it. You either see it or you are blind to it.  There&apos;s no argument to be had.

I&apos;m sincerely disappointed with the amount of straight up conspiracy theory claptrap in this comments section. If someone wanted to audit an electronic voting machine it&apos;s entirely possible. Run a thousand identical ballots through see what happens, check the update history for the software. It&apos;s really not difficult to identify irregularities as computers tend to keep good records when changes occur in any of their hardware, drivers, software, or file systems. It really seems that many people didn&apos;t even bother to read the article and nobody addresses any of the points made. It&apos;s certain that our elections are run in an astoundingly poor and inconsistent manner and that fixes need to be pushed across the country, but the sheer volume of baseless accusations, and outright untruths makes me cringe. Full Disclosure: I voted for Bernie in MA primaries.

Lat night Bill Maher had some of the same below discussion with Van Jones and Leslie Stahl, e.g., why do we have two of the most disliked candidates in decades as the party favorites?  And, to those who fear that Bernie would be trashed by Republicans, what do they think will happen with Hillary?

" If Hillary Clinton entered the race with a very large lead in the national polls and an enormous amount of support from Democratic Party activists and elected officials, as she did, and then quickly built up a significant lead in pledged delegates, as she did, then at no time since the start of the race, regardless of how unscrupulous her campaign might be, would there be any rational motive for risking infamy by rigging the vote."

What an absurd argument.  Clinton and her cam- well knew that the initial sweep of Southern States would prop up the delegate vote in their favor, and they assumed Bernie would drop out, leaving the Queen elect to be coronated.   But as he made it clear he was going to hang in, the need to fix the vote became far more immediate, especially as the Clinton camp looked down the line and saw the coming wave of pro-Bernie states, culminating in the greatest of them all: California.

Both primaries and caucuses are subject to corruption. In a primary, the voting machines can be readily tampered, and in the absence of paper ballots or receipts to check the tallies, there is no redress. 
In caucuses, the rounding off system creates inaccurate results if the persons making the final tallies are biased. I saw this happen at my caucus in Iowa--Bernie lost part of a delegate in my precinct, and the majority of the precinct convenors were pro-Clinton. In my belief he likely won Iowa, though only by a percentage or two, but it would have shifted the narrative.
We need an electoral commission to set up fair voting procedures nationwide, and the removal of the primary process from the control of each of the two corrupt reigning parties.

"You donât need to cheat when youâre winning" ????? what kind of argument is this? Maybe you are winning because you cheated!!!!

"ï»¿Maybe you are winning because you cheated!!!!"

The first piece went into more detail on why this conclusion is so unlikely. If you look at FiveThirtyEight&apos;s weighted polling average, which is considered the gold standard, you&apos;ll see that at no point in the campaign has HRC led by less than 9 points.

This is an important conversation to be having, and I appreciate the piece. The entire system is set up so that only predictable, regular, and well established voters can vote. This makes is impossible for someone like Sanders to come in and have a fair shot, and it makes it hard for anyone who wants to get involved to join in and vote. That is not the same as rigging this particular election (which may have been rigged, but I just don&apos;t know), but it it also worth really thinking about so we can start addressing how these systems have been problematic for years. We need to push back on things like voter purges, underfunded polling stations (hours/machines/staffing), voter I.D. laws etc. Without a fair voting process, places like NY and AZ shouldn&apos;t even count since there is no way to believe that the results represent an accessible or fair process.

After an article last week I decided this journalist was not worth paying for and canceled my subscription with the Nation. After seeing this new article I am very glad I did.

I&apos;m with you. This will be my first and last subscription to The Nation, and Joshua Holland&apos;s tripe about "nothing to see here" -- despite all evidence to the contrary -- has contributed mightily to my decision.

I&apos;m right behind you. Joshua Holland doesn&apos;t see the evidence because he doesn&apos;t *want* to. It&apos;s out there all over the place.

Allegations of voter fraud follow Hillary Clinton campaign across nation http://ktar.com/story/1029529/allegations-of-voter-fraud-follow-hillary-clinton-campaign-across-nation/
The New York Primary was a Sh*tshow. Hereâs Why. 


https://34justice.com/2016/04/22/the-new-york-primary-was-a-shtshow-heres-why/

What I find interesting is the implicit premise of the title: That it is okay to accuse a Republican campaign of election theft without evidence.

What thin and acrid smoke is blown for Hillary by this article!  ï»¿ Wasserman and Fitrakis are right, Holland&apos;s argument is indeed hard to follow.  He begins by arbitrarily refusing to recognize the substantiality of the evidence before everyone&apos;s eyes.  Ultimately, his entire argument depends on the thin logical reed that Hillary wouldn&apos;t cheat because she had no motive to cheat because she had no reason to believe she faced any serious risk of losing the nomination.  That proposition is absurd on countless levels.

First, a paranoid is always afraid.  Don&apos;t forget that Hillary is a firm believer in vast conspiracies.  Second, this isn&apos;t just about Hillary&apos;s personal psyche.  Institutional behavior and group psychology are also in play.  Hillary and Bill sit atop a vast institutional apparatus deeply invested in Hillary becoming President.  Finally, it has been evident ever since Iowa and New Hampshire that Hillary&apos;s campaign was in deep trouble and needed to pull out all the stops if it hoped to maintain a satisfactory level of confidence that she actually will be the nominee.  

Ultimately Holland&apos;s thesis falls victim to the error of believing (his own?) the Establishment narrative, the official Hillary meme of her inevitablility.  That is the fundamental fallacy of circular reasoning.

There are no Clinton supporters involved in this dispute. I back Bernie, and Wasserman and Fitrakis say they&apos;re supporting Jill Stein.

But with your superficial "nothing to see here" articles -- flying in the face of mountains of evidence -- you ARE supporting Sec. Clinton. You&apos;re like Bill Mahr, "Bernie supporter," constantly shouting "eat the chicken, eat the chicken, eat the chicken!" (Sorry, Bill, Joshua, but that chicken is riddled with salmonella -- pure poison to anyone foolish enough to swallow it.)

I don&apos;t think that&apos;s relevant. You can "blow smoke" for her inadvertently without supporting her.

I, too, find the fundamental "logical" argument critically flawed. Not only that, but this article is dripping with resentment for Fitrakis and Wasserman. At times it sounds like you are on the edge of conducting a character assassination in an attempt to bolster your argument. Maybe that wasn&apos;t the intention, but it sure seems hostile.

The author of this article assumes that because Hill was the favorite from before the campaign began, and because she won more delegates early, she had no motivation to cheat.

That is the epitome of absurdity.

If she was so damned far ahead and had nothing to be afraid of, then why is she afraid to release the transcripts?

Do I REALLY need to recount the fact that she hears Bernie&apos;s footsteps hot on her tail?

There has not yet been, and may never be, developed a computerized election system that is free of all risk of hacking.

The higher the stakes, the greater the likelihood any election will be subject to tampering.

Only fools who refuse to examine the plethora of evidence accept that our election systems are adequately secure.

How do you get paragraph returns in your replies here? No matter what I try, mine always end up as a block of text.

I don&apos;t think your article is going to cool a lot tempers.

This election has had major issues and it&apos;s gotten many people suspicious.  Personally, I was one of the signatures on the petition to have the DOJ investigate the Arizona debacle, and I&apos;ve been watching a lot of the local meetings they&apos;ve been having.  It&apos;s a shame.  There were also issues between the campaigns in Nevada and Colorado.  Then the purging of the Brooklyn voters added more fuel to the fire...   I recently watched a news report on how Rhode Island is closing a huge number of its polling locations like Arizona did.  For an election with such high interest, how does that make any sense?  Also, today&apos;s fresh scoop, Anonymous hinted that they&apos;ve found gaps in the security where someone could hack in and mess with the election.  There&apos;s too much circulating, including an old documentary about the voting fraud when Bush was first elected.  Ugh!  It&apos;s making me paranoid.  I wish your article was more reassuring, but I still feel like Tom Cruise stumbling out of the masked "Fidelio" party.

"ï»¿I don&apos;t think your article is going to cool a lot tempers."

I think you&apos;re right!

What do you make of this?

So effing sad. I&apos;ve been following the primaries from here in India--am Indian--with great enthusiasm this time &apos;round because of Bernie. I disagree with him about certain things, especially his still rather muted take on Israeli apartheid, but still think his gesture of solidarity towards Palestine and Palestinians was an extraordinary show of courage. He didn&apos;t back down during the debate in Brooklyn, didn&apos;t even attempt to water down his stance. Truly rare...in any democracy anywhere today! That&apos;s one of the reasons why I love him, and also why I&apos;m gutted to see how the American electoral process hobbles/disenfranchises the electorate. 

Elections here aren&apos;t conflict free, but they&apos;re definitely subject to more and better controls. For one thing, we have an independent, centralised Election Commission that&apos;s proven pretty rock solid in administering national elections. 

Hillary is so lackluster and uninspiring. I know many Americans are excited because she&apos;s a woman, but so were Maggie Thatcher and Indira Gandhi. Sure Hillary&apos;s a Democrat, but a moneyed, priviledged one at that. Gandhi too belonged to the &apos;secular&apos; Congress party but was quite dictatorial (she declared a state of emergency, and sought to stifle the press, suppressed dissent etc. It didn&apos;t last long thankfully. Having a woman become your leader doesn&apos;t necessarily imply you&apos;re shattering a glass ceiling. It just means that another, more opaque one has erased/subsumed the gender pre-requisite and become the stronger for it. &apos;It&apos; would be military-industrial corporatism.)

Ugh...all the paragraphs have disappeared! Now it just reads like stream-of-consciousness twaddle. Hope folks can make sense of it!

Yes, that&apos;s happened to me, also. Later, revisiting your comment here, you might find that your paragraph breaks are BACK, which can happen. In any event, your comment was excellent, with or without paragraph breaks. Thank you for your contribution to this discussion. (All The Nation wants to talk about is "Inevitability" and "Nothing to see here," in the face of massive voter suppression, vote-flipping, and other rampant shenanigans. I guess Holland and company are more comfortable with fascism than the rest of us. He probably saw no problem in Florida 2000, either; because of people like him, THAT coup succeeded, and we no longer have a Bill of Rights or the rule of law.)

I have direct experience of election rigging. I live in Watauga County, NC and, for two years, I was the only Democrat on a three person Board of Elections.  Right after the Voting Rights Act was eviscerated by the Supreme Court, North Carolina enacted what was termed the "worst voter suppression law in the country."   My experience, trying to stand up for my fellow citizens&apos; right to vote in the face of the determined efforts of the Republicans who had taken over, almost completely, the mechanisms of government, was intense and exhausting and rarely successful.   This takeover was funded by Art Pope, a protege and follower of the Koch Brothers.   They quickly, upon taking over, gerrymandered the state, so that they would always win.  When the governorship changed hands in 2012, so did the boards of election, both local and state.  The local boards had two Republicans and one Democrat, the state boards, had three Republicans and two Democrats.  They immediately got rid of as many board staff as they could, so there would be no institutional memory.  They then, in all the counties, began to do the following:  consolidate precincts so there would long lines and move the precincts so that they were very hard to get to, get rid of all the university polling sites and find new ones that were impossible to get to by foot or by public transportation.  They mistreated and cut the budget of our beloved Executive Director, who had been honestly doing her job for 29 years, and forced her to retire, putting in her place a man with no relevant experience other than being the past chair of the Republican party in our county.  Voter suppression was just one aspect of the new efforts by our rulers to put Republican pipe dreams in force. They have attacked and harmed our education system, taking away teacher aides, lowering salaries to the point where they are now below Mississippi. Unfunding the public schools so their cronies could use public funds to create Charter schools and put that money in their own pockets. They refused the ACA, so that 500,000 citizens who qualified for Medicaid could not get it.  The University system is now being ruled by people who want to "run it as a business," meaning college professors have to spend hours doing data entry so that they can "prove" that what they do has created "results."  They appointed in spite of fierce opposition a new President of the Board of Governors of the UNC University system, Margaret Spellings, who was G.W. Bush&apos;s Education Secretary, and only has a Bachelor&apos;s degree and wants to put into place even more draconian cuts and burdensome rules.  And finally, we have the new bathroom bill, which I hope I don&apos;t have to tell  you what that is.  I can&apos;t make this short, but what I want to say is that just because YOU don&apos;t know something, doesn&apos;t mean that other people are making it up!  It seemed utter clear to me that what was once the province of the Republicans has now spread to the Democrats.   If Hillary&apos;s people, and the MSM and Goldman Sachs, etc. were not putting their foot on the scale in this election, they are certainly doing a great imitation of it.

How can you prove that voter fraud did not happened? You can&apos;t. Proof requires factual data acquired through a forensic investigation, not a writers antidotal evidence. You debating the counterpoint doesn&apos;t equal facts. So pump the brakes on dismissing peoples right to question the integrity of the system.

I&apos;m very sad to see the willingness of my fellow
Bernie supporters to assume that Hillary is so
currupt.  The vast "right-wing conspiracy" has done 
a "good" job, perhaps good enough to get Trump or Cruz elected president.   You are fools!

The Clinton campaign has already said that nothing is corruption, as long as it is legal.  Here is where I disagree with this article.  While computer mysteries and such are distressing, the obvious rigging was done by rules: most recently the "Closed" primary system which prevented the most politically active Democratic voters in New York from participating in the primary unless they adjusted their registration over six months in advance.
It is all legal, but not only alters the outcome, but sacrifices Democrats chances of bringing new voters into the party.  Why would they do this?
I&apos;d go with Wasserman-Schultz explanation of SuperDlelegates: "to protect the party from grass roots."
Wonder why Democrats lose Presidential and mid-term elections so effin&apos; often?
Make it a closed club, create high barriers to entry, and wonder why people don&apos;t join.

I do not understand Nichelson&apos;s argument that the closed Democratic primary system in New York "prevented the most politically active Democratic voters in New York from participating in the primary  unless they adjusted their registration over six months in advance." If the officials running this system were doing their job correctly, then anyone who was one of "the most politically active Democratic voters" would already be registered as a Democrat, and would therefore not have to change his or her registration in order to vote. Perhaps he is confused because at least in Brooklyn, election officials, for reasons which we do not yet know, purged more than 100,000 registered Democrats from the polls without notifying them. Whatever happened here was wrong, but there is absolutely no reason on the public record so far that would lead you to assume that the voters who were purged would have been supporters of Sanders, or of Clinton for that matter.

Of course there is: They were overwhelmingly and primarily purged in Brooklyn, Bernie&apos;s hometown, not Manhattan which was a Hillary stronghold because of Wall Street.

Sanders did better in Brooklyn than in Manhattan, but Clinton won the borough overall. Three of Sanders&apos; best neighborhoods were in Brooklyn, but two of Clinton&apos;s top were in the borough. Tell me this: How could anyone know which candidate a voter would support based solely on their registration? The pre-election polls certainly wouldn&apos;t give you precise enough results to do it by neighborhood.

Surely you are aware that certain demographics are more favorable to Bernie. Doesn&apos;t seem farfetched that the voters could be targeted based on their age, etc.

See the link below. AG Schneiderman, a Hillary supporter, calls the level of complaints unprecedented. Across the state, polling place after polling place reported highly unusual, if not unprecedented numbers of voters who had to vote with affidavit ballots that may never be counted. The Democratic establishment and elections officials are considering it so serious that they are actually firing people (the wrong people) and promising audits (but not by independent entities and not of the actual affidavit ballots) .

In Arizona, another closed primary, there were also highly unusual numbers of people whose registrations mysteriously flipped. The Secretary of State, apparently a moral person who was clearly distraught by what happened, called it election fraud. Can one absolutely prove who did this and how it happened? The nature of electronic election fraud, whether voter purges or rigged machines, most still without paper trails, is that it&apos;s very difficult, perhaps impossible to prove. That&apos;s what makes it so dangerous.

But by all means let&apos;s just go on like this, with more and more skewed elections and people increasingly feeling that their votes don&apos;t count. Great idea. The only important thing, after all, is to protect Hillary Clinton, at least for some writers here. 

I am very disappointed that The Nation published this. We get quite enough of these apologia for the Clintons in corporate media. Do we need to read them here as well?

http://ivn.us/2016/04/21/new-yorkers-upset-fraudulent-primary-practices/

Wonderfully put. Thank you.

We shouldn&apos;t go on like this. Our election systems are an utter disgrace.

"We&apos;ll fix it next time. Return to your jobs. Democracy or something like it will happen sometime in the future. In the meantime enjoy the opposite."

Thanks heaps.

I actually have very little confidence that we&apos;ll ever fix it.

If so, then I want a "do over."

"ï»¿ If Hillary Clinton entered the race with a very large lead in the national polls and an enormous amount of support from Democratic Party activists and elected officials, as she did, and then quickly built up a significant lead in pledged delegates, as she did, then at no time since the start of the race, REGARDLESS OF HOW UNSCRUPULOUS HER CAMPAIGN MIGHT BE, would there be any rational motive for risking infamy by rigging the vote. You donât need to cheat when youâre winning."
Seriously, this is one of the stupidest arguments one can make. She was ahead at the beginning because of Superdelegates, the DNC actively trashing Bernie, and a lack of meaningful media coverage for Bernie. Then, low and behold, he started winning caucuses and primaries. Hillary was NOT going to allow this to happen AGAIN. Lady Macbeth of the Democratic Kingdom took some cues from Richard Nixon - when falling behind, lie and cheat. Talk to me after the NY debacle is investigated. Bernie&apos;s loss will likely be in the single digits, and he may well pick up delegates after the fact (like in other states). She&apos;s trying to run out the clock - but she&apos;s alienated MANY of the voters she needs to defeat Trump. He&apos;s already calling her Crooked Hillary - and all he has to do to point out her craven nature is to show a picture of Bill and Hil at his 3rd wedding. Trolling for dollars in "return for favors" makes Trump the boss and Hillary the sycophant. If Hillary is the appointed nominee, we&apos;re screwed because Trump will win.
Seriously self-serving piece of drivel not befitting The Nation. We already KNOW the thieves in Washington "adjusted" the law to make what has been illegal, legal. To use that as an excuse for inexcusable behavior is disgusting

It&apos;s a perfectly reasonable article. Completely rational. He didn&apos;t make any excuses for our horrible system.

It has nothing to do with the super delegates. In the original piece, I cited FiveThirtyEight&apos;s weighted polling average on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, and then looked at her lead in pledged delegates through Super Tuesday. 

I&apos;m a Sanders supporter, and The Nation endorsed Sanders.

Yeah, Hillary was looking at those numbers and then got the wind knocked out of her.  I can well imagine the knot of cold, hard fear in her belly.

Sure, and so is Joan Walsh. (rolleyes)

I&apos;m calling bs on this.

You wouldn&apos;t know it.  With friends like the Nation, Bernie doesn&apos;t need enemies.

Missed the point.  Your assumption was that Hillary would not rig an election she was winning (Superdelegates being one factor in her inevitability).
Joanne suggests victory was not so certain, and became even less so as the primary went on, hence the need to cheat.
I agree more with her original sentence "That is one of the stupidest arguments one can make."  A cheater leavers nothing to chance, and wouldn&apos;t pass up an "Edge" just because it wasn&apos;t absolutely necessary.  Your argument contains no warrant whatsoever.

I chose to make that case in the first piece because I know from experience how easy it is to go down the rabbit&apos;s hole debating conspiracy theorists. In this piece, I&apos;m just saying that they&apos;re factual claims are wrong.

THEIR factual claims.

Also, many of the early states were states the democrats will likely lose in November: Iowa, South Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, etc. Building up a lead with these states is not very predictive.

Watch out!  You will soon see an article scolding Bernie for disrespecting Southern Democrats.

Yes...and when Hillary loses in November, it will be his fault for "damaging" her.

Absolutely! Well said. The seed for that rationalization started weeks ago when Kampf Hillary voiced concerns over the Sanders campaign&apos;s "tone."

Why do I see little if any comment about "old fashioned" ethics rules that have banned lawyers and judges from being involved in cases where they are prejudiced "or may give the appearance" of prejudice.  This certainly should apply to our representatives don&apos;t you think?

It may not be a national committee&apos;s conspiracy to rig elections (in a number of ways) that would screw up the vote, but it may be only an obscure local operative (who secretly, personally would desire an particular outcome) that "do dirty" and no one has to know, especially not their superiors.  If there&apos;s an easy way to cheat and get away with it, people will always cheat.  The "honor system" is cover for corruption.

Truth is not the issue.  Competency and accuracy are.  There should be a federal law stating that if demonstrated unexplained technical anomalies occur in the voting process, all the votes in the votes precincts involved would be disqualified.  That should raise objections from all parties, particularly those that voted.  IN OREGON, WE HAVE HAD MAIL IN VOTING SINCE 1998.  There are still polling place to vote on election day, if you prefer.  The ballots are sent out about 5 weeks before the election, and if you don&apos;t get a ballot in the mail by that time, you still have 21 days before the election to register.  FROM WIKIPEDIA:  "Vote-by-mail in Oregon has maintained a high level of support since it was passed in 1998. A survey done in 2003 by Dr. Priscilla Southwell, a professor of Political Science at University of Oregon, shows that 81% of respondents favored the vote-by-mail system. 19% favored voting at the polls. The poll also shows high favorability among both registered Democrats (85%) and Republicans (76%). 30% of respondents said they voted more often since vote-by-mail was enacted."

A lot of these problems would go away with adequate funding for election administration, superior equipment and better training for election workers.

I honestly don&apos;t think lack of funding, training and "inferior equipment" are the main issue.

Why do you think all European countries still use paper ballots which are hand-counted at precinct or polling place level (in the presence of representatives of all parties and independent observers)? It&apos;s certainly not because they are luddites or can&apos;t afford computer technology - but rather because "if it&apos;s not broken, why fix it"?

And in the context of U.S. elections "fix" does, indeed, increasingly appear the best word to use. All electronic voting needs to have a paper trail, verifiable by the individual voter themselves immediately after the fact in the form of a receipt, as well as on an institutional level.

And any deviation of more than 3% from exit polls should lead to an automatic audit of the voting results and a manual recount if necessary. Unlike pre-election polls, which often prove wrong, representatively conducted exit polls are considered the international gold standard election monitors, with deviations from them taken as serious indications of electoral fraud. 

The fact that you place great weight in the former regarding e.g. Mass, while dismissing how seriously wrong the latter were in New York as irrelevant, does your "argument" no favors whatsoever! As a control example we can look at the United Kingdom general election last year. 538 and all other (including party internal) polls predicted a "hung parliament" with no party achieving an outright majority. The exit polling on the day shockingly diverged from this, but it was soon clear that it was 100% accurate, both in terms of a comfortable majority for the Conservatives and in the performance of smaller parties!

Fantastic comment! If The Nation wants to drop the unprincipled establishment mouthpiece who wrote this alleged article, they should hire you in his place!

I want a do-over!!!!!

Funny thing that you use the total mess of our electoral system over the years as justification somehow?  All that really does is point out just how easy it might be to sway election results, and maybe just why the current archaic system never gets fixed.  I hate to say it, but this is one instance when even Trump has a point.  Sure, you in the media spin this type of thing as merely sour grapes by either the "losers" or the blowhard, nothing to see here folks, move along.  And just how do you think we&apos;ve come to an election where Trump is even considered a viable candidate?  Because voting is not only boring, but tedious and most likely rigged.  Why SHOULD people bother when they know there are ways to make their votes not count?  We all saw what happened in 2000, and while there was outrage, people deferred to the Supremes and moved on.  But we all know that was tainted, and we are seeing more of it now, but this time it&apos;s far more blatant.  Why involve the SCOTUS when you can simply trash a few ballots?  Better yet, when it gets to the point where no one bothers anymore, so much the better.  I was hoping I would not see the day come of total Corporate rule, I was hoping we really would wake up and stop this ship before we hit the iceburg.  We are not going to be allowed to do that I&apos;m afraid.

Yet ANOTHER individual commenting here who makes the hack author of this article look like an unqualified shill! Well done (now please, take his job -- he&apos;s not doing anything worthwhile with it, unless cozying up to authoritarians is worthwhile).

It&apos;s no justification at all. If a different candidate were being accused of election-theft, wouldn&apos;t you want some evidence?

There is LOTS of evidence.  You just refuse to credit it.

Is this article about the integrity of elections, or is it about defending the Clintons?

Their claim would be interesting and no amount of investigation is unwarranted. However more troubling is how the corporate media is manufacturing results. 
Clearly they have not been neutral in their coverage nor are they disinterested parties.  The lack of integrity on their part  is revolting .

It&apos;s one thing  to know and understand that corporate media is just that. It&apos;s another thing to expect citizens running for office to adhere to higher standards, to be covered equally, fairly by PBS at least voters would have an opportunity to learn.

True, in the MSM we hear a lot about sensational results, but next to nothing about 125,000 lost votes in Brooklyn.  Our "former" democracy has sunk to a pathetic low, thanks to our becoming a corporate-tocracy.

What is little reported is that Brooklyn is one of boros in NY that would have been covered, under the pre-clearance rules of the Voting Rights Act, had it not been stricken down by SCOTUS.

"We the People" is enshrined in the Constitution. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Although not specifically laid out, the right to vote is implied in those three words. The mess that is voting in this country needs to be addressed based on those three words, meaning a country-wide standardized system, using modern technology. The estimated cost to modernize voting is $1 billion. Although not an insignificant amount of money it&apos;s a one-time investment in our democracy. Can a $17 trillion economy not afford to do so?

As for the argument that the Democratic primary is rigged, the loud noises are coming from Sanders supporters concerning the states that Sec. Clinton won. But we do not hear them complaining about the open disenfranchisement that caucuses openly cause for the simple reason he won 10 of 13.

How does a caucus sway the vote? First of all, voting is not done privately, without peer pressure. We donât vote openly in the general election so why should anyone have to do so in the primary? The second reason is that caucuses make it too difficult for many people to vote. There are people who work and cannot get time off to spends the requisite hours in a caucus meeting held at a specific time. And people with infirmities either through age or other reasons are excluded because of the physical stamina required to attend.

Ardent Sanders support and host of a show on Sirius XMâs âProgressâ channel, Thom Hartmann, always ends with the admonition that âDemocracy is not a spectator sport.â The New York Primary apparently has had the same rules for 40 years. Obviously 1.8 million people must have taken his advice seriously because they were able to successfully navigate those rules. Anyone, purged off the rolls by mistake is right to complain; anyone who didnât follow them and was ineligible to vote does not.

The caucus system may be clumsy and a creaky artifact but it is really hard to rig, difficult to cheat in the counting or tabulation.  And, if anything, it is inherently more favorable to Hillary than to Bernie.  The inconveniences and hardship work more against Bernie supporters than Hillary supporters.  The public aspect presents greater risk of retaliation to Bernie supporters than Hillary supporters, as well as helping protect the integrity of the process.

By all means, let&apos;s have voting reform.  Let&apos;s end Citizens United.   Let&apos;s end the caucus system too.  I agree with you and the vast majority of the country does as well.  Do those who represent _you_ fight for this?  Do the media sources where you get your information fight for this, or do they tell you about "Bernie Bros"?   I&apos;m not a spectator.  I am a gainfully-employed, law-abiding, tax paying citizen who was a registered Democrat and was deprived of my vote in the only NY primary in memory that has actually mattered.  My overwhelming sense is that I was deprived of my vote by the Democrats themselves - and this should be a major concern to every establishment Democrat, because I am _far_ from the only one who feels this way.  We&apos;re not "radicals" - at least not yet.   And to dismiss the results of the respectful, adult caucus system of, say, Colorado - these people are not spectators either, and they&apos;re not simply a bunch of teenagers swayed by peer pressure.  To compare it with the extremely contentious media-spun "wins" in Mass. and Iowa, the travesty in Arizona, and now NY, with the near-absolute media silence following these.... just consider it for a minute.  

I&apos;m not giving up, in spite of it all.

Yayyyy! I am so very happy to see so many wonderfully impassioned, principled, smart, eloquent comments here -- like yours -- trying to wake up our somnambulist friend, Mr. Holland! He may be too ensconced in the circles of power to care about massive irregularities and fraud determining who leads America, but the rest of us care a great deal. Some of us even understand that fascism must ALWAYS be resisted... even when it has a "D" attached to its preferred candidate&apos;s name. (But Joshua, don&apos;t take it too hard: your side, by hook and by crook, is "winning" -- and that means endless genocidal wars in the Middle East driven by the CIA and MIC and more/bigger bank bailouts; very profitable, for folks in your circle! Frack the future, it&apos;s only the ecosystem in the balance. Happy days.)

Your "overwhelming sense"? What does that (whatever it may be) have to do with a cogent narrative, let alone evidence, of wrongdoing? You&apos;re as vague (and therefore as feckless) as your losing candidate.

Richard, you&apos;re right.  I don&apos;t have my DMV receipt, as I said.  My comment was written in great frustration that the irregularities in the primary are immediately disappeared from public view in the media, just as the Sanders campaign was from the beginning.   I am also bewildered at The Nation&apos;s apparent pivot towards the standard âClinton inevitabilityâ narrative when there are 1,600 pledged delegates remaining and fewer than 300 pledged delegates separating the two candidates.   I apologize if that frustration was unjustly directed at Joshua Holland, who is not the enemy.

I won&apos;t insult you.  My use of âoverwhelming senseâ is trying to convey this: older, established Democrats â the ones with the institutional positions, the security, the power - must understand that the status quo is not working.  They are acting like it still is.  Strong-arm tactics, media whitewash, get in line behind the anointed candidate, pander to the base and cozy up to finance and military â it&apos;s not working.  

And Sanders is not a loser.  He has the highest favorability ratings by 10% and the only overall positive ratings of any candidate.  He wins huge with Independents, many of whom are currently going to the mat for issues that the Dem Party has long claimed it supports.  He dominates every Republican candidate.  We&apos;re not the unwashed masses.  We&apos;re not extremist right-wingers taking over government buildings.  We can get the Republicans out of the house and senate and maybe survive the climate crisis.  I&apos;m afraid that Clinton might not be able to do this.  That&apos;s all I got.

Wes Matthews,  why does Bernie&apos;s favorability ratings mean more than his delegate totals? Hillary is winning because more voters went to the polls on election days in one state after another and voted for her.   Which company phones which sample of people and asks which questions somehow erases that?
Why think Hillary is winning when 1400 delegates remain un-pledged because a dozen or so states have yet to vote? Keep in mind that we&apos;ve been here before: Hillary voters in 2008 lived through this same kind of dynamic that Bernie supporters are dealing with now: or 2008 candidate couldn&apos;t catch up but we kept convincing ourselves that she still might.  We held out hope that she&apos;s somehow make up the gap and week after week and primary night after primary night we found our hopes to be ridiculous.  Bernie supporters are stuck supporting a campaign that is much much further behind than Hillary&apos;s 2008 campaign every was but we all can see and do the math: he will never catch up.  That Jeff Weaver is proposing ignoring the delegate totals and trying to flip super delegates after the DC primary is so preposterous: what would happen if the campaign&apos;s situations were reversed right now and Hillary&apos;s people were proposing and raising money on the idea that we could subvert the results of all these primaries and still win in a convention fight?  
The argument thatBernie wins big with independents is really meaningless when the battle is for the party nomination: the key factor always was and still remains who do democrats want?  That is and always was the crucial and only real factor.  Who do democrats want to run?  
All the rest of this is circus.

I just gave a "thumbs-up" to your excellent comment, but I strongly disagree with you on one point: establishment journalists who cover up the stealing of an election ARE the enemy. Whatever happy, nice, NPR-friendly things he&apos;s done in the past, today Joshua Holland is championing the forces of fascism, saying "nothing to see here" as they extinguish democracy in America. That shilling for autocrats, for me, is TRES problematic... and I can&apos;t help but think of this writer as a bit scummy as a consequence of his dereliction of duty. He should be investigating the vote suppression and fraud, not DENYING it. There&apos;s something very wrong here, from a journalistic perspective... and from an American one.

True, there ought to be laws/rules for treating individual disenfranchised voters with at least as much respect, and avenues of redress open to them, as dog-bite victims get on "Judge Judy."  If we continue to ignore these HUGE anomalies, we can no longer call ourselves a Democracy.

It&apos;s a thin line, when you know in your gut that something is rotten in the process, not to cross over into the realm of conspiracy. However just the very fact of the media bias in this election cycle makes it hard not fall into that trap. The fact of pre-pledged delegates that do not necessarily reflect the preferences of the Dem. Party&apos;s rank and file, but instead promote the Establishment elites choice is patently undemocratic. When you couple this with the constantly repeated message that the decisions have already been made, ss we see every day in the MSM, it becomes very difficult not to feel that our choices have no value and to resist is futile. I hate this feeling.

Mendacity is the word for the MSM myth of "pre-pledged" delegates.  The superdelegates of course are not pre-pledged.  They are not pledged at all.  They are in reality mere endorsements.  They are not bound in any way until they actually vote at the Convention.  Their job, as a group, is consider the interests of the party and the goals of the people they represent, deliberate, and make deals on the threshhold of the ultimate decision.  That is not a job they can do far in advance, with inadequate data.  To report them on the side of either candidate as if their present position mattered is a deception, plain and simple, but that is what has been systematically done.

By pre-pledged delegates I deduce you mean the super delegates. I don&apos;t believe that the supers are pre-pledged to any candidate. And with the many states that permit anyone to vote in the primary elections, there&apos;s absolutely no evidence that those states&apos; primary totals "reflect the preferences of the Dem. Party&apos;s rank and file."  Your fantasy complaints may make it harder to get appropriate attention for the real minority/poor voter suppression that hurts true Democrats in the undeservedly red states.

I hear you! We all have to get more involved in our local state governments where reform matters.

Now it is both the media AND the DLC/super-delegates, breeding apathy for the opposition to the party elites&apos; choice.

Apathy is the natural hangover of the irrationally exuberant.

The very strong Persistence, over an extended period of time, of voting confusion, targeted purges, secret or arcane rules, and dubious electronic methods of counting and protecting ballot results is ALL a very strong and reasonable indication of deliberate purpose. There is a history to voting obstructions in the USA that only fools or sycophants are willing to pardon. The âeliteâ plutocrats and corporations who fund the current corrupted system through vetted Party operatives (aka âThe Establishmentâ) do not come to this investigation with clean hands. They are no longer entitled to âthe benefit of the doubtâ in these accusations, if they ever were.

Hillary Clinton&apos;s apologists and every useful idiot that voted for Hillary Clinton will be responsible for President Trump.

Indeed. They have been adequately forewarned. If Hillary is nominated, Hillbots will OWN responsibility for the Trump administration.

It&apos;s Sanders&apos; sore loser destructiveness that is giving the Republicans extra ammunition.  Trump is already quoting Sanders in his speeches. Those two, and their blame-everyone-else fanatic fans, make a fitting pair.

Video of the Chicago Board of Elections, where some election observers felt there were "adjustments" made to the totals in favor of Clinton.  Pertinent commentary begins about 25 minutes into the video.

I&apos;m not an investigative reporter--maybe this is all legitimate, but the observers did not seem happy.  Perhaps The Nation will dig into this--I&apos;d love to know what&apos;s going on.

While you&apos;re at it, maybe you can shed some light on the allegation that a PAC supporting Clinton is sending shills to "correct" online comments like this one I&apos;m making:  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/21/hillary-pac-spends-1-million-to-correct-commenters-on-reddit-and-facebook.html

It looks like we have one of them right here in this comment thread.

I might have believed Mr. Holland if not my experience in the NY primary.  I was a registered Democrat.   I received mail from Obama and local Dem officials at my home.  I can&apos;t prove this, because I did not keep my four-year-old drivers license registration (how many people do? - be sure I will be one of them from here on.) Midway through the primary season, I check my registration to find out it is listed as "Independent".  There is no recourse - I re-register as a Democrat but at that point it&apos;s too late.  I show up at the polling place anyway on primary day.  The old ladies behind the desk tell me that people have been showing up all day long and they&apos;re not on the voting rolls, whereupon they give me an affidavit ballot, which everyone knows is worthless.   They tell me that people were purged "because they hadn&apos;t voted in four years" - in other words, since the last presidential election - as if that is a reasonable explanation.  

Is it indeed legal for the Board of Elections to purge voters who hadn&apos;t voted in a mere four years?  Is it legal for them to purge 130,000 Democratic voters in Brooklyn alone, where Hillary won by a margin of fewer than than 60,000 votes?  

And should it surprise us that the investigation into the voter purge will be run by a Hillary Clinton delegate?  

Will you defend this as "legal"?  Will you defend Bill Clinton&apos;s blocking of polling places in Massachusetts as "legal"?  It is clear that there has been a massive clampdown on the Sanders campaign from the start, through the media and now through the primary voting process.  Instead of addressing the massive problem of legitimate voter anger and disillusionment, Mr. Holland and The Nation plays apologist.  Given the fact that Sanders would not lose to a Republican candidate, while there is a clear possibility of Hillary losing to them, it is amazing that they side with the Democratic establishment so regularly.  NPR, NY Times, The Nation - I used to respect these institutions.  What a travesty.

You said it, Wes!  ^^^THIS, a thousand times... would that we still had a functioning free press.

I hear ya loud and clear.  What&apos;s even weirder is how each state was it&apos;s own quirky rules and regulations "rigging" their system.  As one pendant stated one party with 2 names..... and the older I get the wiser I understand.
