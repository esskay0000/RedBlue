The world is sleepwalking into a fresh crisis as investors start to lose faith in policymakersâ ability to revive the global economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.

In its bluntest warning to date on the costs of policy inaction, the IMFÂ saidÂ âfinancial and economicÂ stagnation" could take hold unlessÂ governments preventedÂ aÂ "pernicious feedback loopÂ of fragile confidence, weaker growth, low inflation and rising debt burdens" from forming.

JosÃ© ViÃ±als, the head of the IMF's financial stability division, said a prolonged slowdown couldÂ knock around 4pc off global outputÂ relative to current expectations over the next five yearsÂ amid repeated bouts of market turmoil.

Mr ViÃ±alsÂ said a $1.3 trillion (Â£912bn) corporate debt timebomb in China also posed "potentially serious challenges" to financial stability if defaults pushed banks over the edge.

The IMF's global financial stability reportÂ said a "loss of market confidence" would dragÂ global bourses into a bear market.

UnderÂ this scenario,Â Stocks in the UK, US, eurozone and China would loseÂ a fifth of their value over two years, it estimated.

TheÂ triple threat of slowerÂ growth,Â rising risks fromÂ China and diminishedÂ faith in policymakers' ability to prevent a fresh downturnÂ meantÂ households and businesses were likely to save more and spend less in the uncertainÂ global environment.

Economic powerhouses such as China and India would see output losses of more than 4pc by 2021 compared with current IMF forecasts, it said, whileÂ world output world be 3.9pc lower relative to the baseline.

âThis would be roughly equivalent to foregoing one year of global growth, said MrÂ ViÃ±als.

Low inflation and nominal growth would also push debt burdens in struggling countries such as Greece and Japan to fresh highs.

This would "entrenchÂ secular stagnation worldwide" the IMF warned.

MrÂ ViÃ±alsÂ called for a "more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and inflation outlook".

He urged policymakers in the eurozone toÂ help banks deal with anÂ "elevated" number of so-called non-performing loans - where debtors are usually three months behind on payments.

In China, the IMFÂ called for an end to implicit subsides that allowed zombie companies to remain in business. ItÂ also said Beijing should equip regulators with the tools needed toÂ policeÂ China's increasingly complex financial system.

âMuch is at stake. Additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix. If not, market turmoil may recur and intensify, said MrÂ ViÃ±als.

"Monetary policy wasÂ becoming "overburdened", the IMF said. Growth-friendly fiscal policies and wider reform would be needed to support the recovery and boost investment and consumption.

Doing this would lead to a "successful normalisation", where a rebound in economic risk taking and confidence encourages spending and "accelerates smooth exits" from the extended period of record low interest rates.

âMonetary policy remains crucial but cannot be the only game in town," said Mr ViÃ±als.

The IMF said there were signs of âwidespread and rising corporate stressâ among Chinese corporates that were taking longer to pay their billsÂ and strugglingÂ to roll over existing debt.

It estimated that around 15.5pc of total commercial bank loans to the corporate sector - worthÂ around $1.3 trillion - were "at risk" of default because companiesÂ did not earnÂ enough income to affordÂ interest payments.

Potential bank losses on these loans could be as high asÂ $756bn -Â or 7pc of Chinaâs GDP. The IMF described this as "substantial".

It highlighted that the average time taken for listed companies in China to pay their suppliers had grown to 72 days in 2015, from 53 days in 2011.

The IMF said strong underlying growth in the economy and existing bank buffers meant China had the capacity toÂ absorb these losses.

However, it warned that continued implicit subsidies by the state could stunt future growth and increase financial stability risks.

Chinese corporate bond debt issuance hadÂ climbed sharply in recent months, the IMF noted.

While steps to liberalise China's bond market were welcome, expanding access toÂ foreign investors and domestic firms could result in a credit crunch if damagedÂ investor confidenceÂ caused markets to seize up.

The IMF urged China to use its "ambitious policy agenda" to encourage fasterÂ corporate write-offs ofÂ bad debtÂ and eliminateÂ implicit governmentÂ guarantees.

It also urged Beijing to resist intervening in ChineseÂ stock marketsÂ to prop up prices.
