HappyÂ Acela Primary Day!

This is the biggest delegate haul up for grabs until theÂ final blast on June 7. Youâd think that would make it more dramatic than it is. But â¦ dah well. Letâs just explain.

There areÂ 172 Republican delegatesÂ up for grabs today:



AndÂ 384 delegates for DemocratsÂ (462 if you include superdelegates, which we arenât because â¦ we can. Yeah, thatâs our power trip):

Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump will officially lock up their nominations today. ButÂ if the polls are right, both areÂ expected to pad their leads. And Clinton could effectivelyÂ dashÂ hopes of a Bernie Sanders rally. Why? Well, once again, a lot of it has to do with the rules.

FOR DEMOCRATS: As weâve told you before,Â Democrats award their delegates proportionally. All five states today (exceptÂ Rhode Island) are closed to independents, which is aÂ huge part of Sandersâ support base. (Few states after today allow independents to cast ballots, either.)Â Rhode Island isÂ sort of open to independents; they can vote in either partyâs election, but if they do vote in one or the other, they have to later "disaffiliate" themselves by filling out a form. Seriously: Who comes up with this stuff?

FOR REPUBLICANS: Rhode Island is a GOP oddball, in that it awards delegates more proportionally than most states. But Connecticutâs sort-of proportional delegates become winner-take-all if a candidate gets at least half of the vote.Â Trump has a good chance of doing that, based on the polls. Combine thatÂ with winner-take-all rules in Maryland and Delaware, where Trump also has the lead, and the swirlyÂ haired guy clearly has the advantage.

Clinton and Trump are expected to win in Pennsylvania. No big drama there. But hereâs where things get interesting: OnlyÂ 17 of the stateâs 71 Republican delegatesÂ are bound to the winner. The rest can vote for whoever they want at the national convention. More interesting: These unbound delegates are elected popularly, not by a few party elites at the state convention, whereÂ Ted Cruz has done aÂ better job than TrumpÂ of gettingÂ slates elected thatÂ would vote for him to theÂ death. (And suddenly, in our mindâs eye, we see people casting ballots while being tortured, yelling, âTed Cruuuuuuuuuzâ in a Scottish brogue while the crowd gently weeps. No wait, thatâs a scene from âBraveheart.â But imagine if thatâs how the GOP convention played out. Hey, weâd watch it.)

Anyway, many of Pennsylvaniaâs unbound delegateÂ candidates have said theyâd vote for the state winner. But the fact remains that they donât HAVE to if crap hits the fan. Which leads us to this gem of a quote from a delegate candidate, asÂ reported in U.S. News and World Report: ââBizarreâ is the best word to describe the whole damn process. This is going to shape up to be a battle."

Ted Cruz made a funny on the campaign trail. Or, well, he thinks itâs funny. âIf Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still canât use the little girlsâ restroom,âÂ Cruz has said repeatedlyÂ to illustrate why heâs against transgender use of public bathrooms. He hasÂ beseeched Jimmy Fallon to digitally dress TrumpÂ in a Clinton pant suit. But Fallon hasnât obliged â and neither, apparently, has the Internet. A Google image search for âTrump dressed as Clintonâ returned nothing.
