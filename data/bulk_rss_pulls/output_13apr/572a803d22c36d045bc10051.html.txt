Reince Priebus thinks that Donald Trump being the Republican nominee might be the unique jolt his party needs.

âYou know what, I think something different and something new is probably good for our party,â the chairman of the Republican National Committee told CNNâsÂ New DayÂ Wednesday.

On Tuesday night, Priebus tweeted his support âÂ and a call for his fractured party to come together â for Trump after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz dropped out of the race following a crushing blow in the Indiana primary.

While Priebus is all-in on Trump, he admitted on Wednesday he didnât see Trump in the 2016 tea leaves a year ago.

âI don't think anyone predicted what happened,â Priebus said. âSo, look, we're here.Â  We're going to get behind the presumptive nominee.Â  I stated the obvious in the tweet. Obviously, you still have to get to 1,237 delegates.â
