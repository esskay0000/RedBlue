The more time young adults spend on social media, the more likely they are to become depressed, a study has found.

Of the 19Â to 32-year-olds who took part in the research, those who checked social media most frequently throughout the week were 2.7 times more likely to develop depression than those who checked least often.

The 1,787 US participants used social media for an average 61 minutes every day, visiting accounts 30 times per week. Of them a quarter were found to have high indicators of depression.

Dr Brian Primack, the director of Pittâs Centre for Research on Media, Technology and Health, led the study, and told The Independent: âIt is important to explain that, because this was a cross-sectional study, directionality is not clear from these results.Â 

âOne strong possibility is that people who are already having depressive symptoms start to use social media more, perhaps because they do not feel the energy or drive to engage in as many direct social relationships.â

Alistair Campbell: "One day, we will look back and wonder how on earth we used to believe that depression was a lifestyle choice, only to be debated and taken seriously when an A List film star took his life, and the world filled with people saying how shocked and saddened they were. "

Stephen Fry: "Depression is as real as the weatherâ¦itâs all about a kind of mental umbrella. 'Hey-ho, itâs raining inside: it isnât my fault and thereâs nothing I can do about it, but sit it out. But the sun may well come out tomorrow and when it does, I shall take full advantage.'"

Ernest Hemingway: "The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places."

Jonathan Davis: "A lot of people don't realize that depression is an illness. I don't wish it on anyone, but if they would know how it feels, I swear they would think twice before they just shrug it."

Geoffrey Boycott: "Until you've had depression I don't think you're qualified to talk about it."

Jack Dee: "I have had issues with depression all my life, and it's probably true to say there was a tendency towards it even when I was very young, during my schooldays. There was often - and this is quite common with comics - a sense of not feeling as if I belonged anywhere."

Annabel Giles: "If youâre depressed right now, then let's remember that we only have to do today, that's all. Nothing more. We can do just a day, can't we? And donât forget, we haven't always been like this. The good days will come back. We've just go to do as much as we can, when we can."

However, he said there are several reasons why increased social media could lead to more depressive thoughts. One example he cited was a phenomenon which is sometimes referred to as âFacebook depressionâ.

âPeople who engage in a lot of social media use may feel they are not living up to the idealised portraits of life that other people tend to present in their profiles.Â 

âAs with many things in the social sciences, it may also be that both of these directions are accurate.Â 

âThis would be concerning, because it would imply that there is a potential vicious circle: people who become depressed may turn to social media for support, but their excessive engagement with it might only serve to exacerbate their depression.â

The study, by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, looked at the 11 most popular social media platforms at the time: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest, Vine and LinkedIn.Â 

There are currently over a billion people actively using Facebook daily, while Twitter attracts 320 million active users every month.

These findings are particularly disturbing as the World Health Organisation published a report in October 2015 which said depression is now the leading cause of disability worldwide.

However, Dr Primack said he could imagine scenarios in which social media could itself become a tool to combat the problem.

âWe hope that this research may provide one piece to the puzzle of how we can best use powerful tools such as social media to our advantage and not our detriment.Â 

âWe certainly do not recommend that people stop using social media. Social media is obviously an extremely important part of modern-day society and has many important functions.

âHopefully the knowledge that there can be emotional risks associated with its use may help individuals to make better choices about the extent to which they use social media and the way in which they use it.â

âIt is important to acknowledge that what we found were just overall tendencies for the entire population therefore, these findings do not suggest that every person who engages with more social media use is depressed in fact there may certainly be groups of people who find solace and lessening of their depression through social media resources and relationships,â he said.
