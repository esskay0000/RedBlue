This afternoon, Republican presidential front-runner Donald J. Trump, fresh from Tuesday nightâs triumphant showing in which he convincingly won five out of five Northeastern states, gave what was billed as a major foreign-policy address at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, DC. Trumpâs appearance was sponsored by what many rightly consider to be a citadel of American realpolitik, the Center for the National Interest, a DC-based think tank that bills itself as âAmericaâs Voice for Strategic Realism.â It is rumored that Trumpâs speech was initially drafted by the Centerâs Richard Burt, a respected former ambassador to Germany under Ronald Reagan.

						});
					
Prior to the speech, the Brookings Institutionâs Thomas Wright observed that the involvement of the center indicates that âWe may be seeing some early dating between the realists and Trump to see if a lasting relationship is possible.â Perhaps. But at a minimum it was expected that Trump would attempt to appear more statesmanlike, if not walk back many of his more outrageous and inflammatory foreign-policy comments, such as his recent boast that he would bring back waterboarding âand make it tougher.â		
Did the Mayflower gambit pay off? Well, not quite.		
A mellower (or just plain tired) Trump took the stage about a half-hour behind schedule after an introduction by former UN ambassador, under George W. Bush, Zalmay Khalilzad. In a bit of deft pandering to his hosts, Trump almost immediately took aim at the Obama administrationâs record of liberal interventionism. According to Trump, the administrationâs reliance on democracy promotion as a tool of US foreign policy has been nothing short of âa complete and total disaster.â Citing the failed adventure in Libya, Trump accused the administration of habitually tearing up existing institutions in the Middle East, then being surprised by the chaos that ensues.		
The centerpiece of Trumpâs presentation was a series of five criticisms of American foreign policy as it has been carried out of late. To those familiar with Trumpâs standard stump speech, the litany was awfully familiar: We are overextended. We donât win anymore. Our allies take advantage of us. Obama is bad to our friends. He bows to our enemies.		
And so on.

When Trump did try to leave the comfort of clichÃ© for the terra incognita of policy, he fared about as well youâd expect: badly. While noting correctly that nuclear weapons serve as the cornerstone of our deterrence posture, Trump declared that the American nuclear arsenal is âdesperatelyâ in need of modernization. Perhaps Trump (or, alarmingly, his advisers) are unaware that in 2015 Obama announced a $1 trillion dollar plan that, according to the Arms Control Association, aims to ârebuild all three legs of the nuclear triad and their associated warheads.â		
Trump blasted the administrationâs decision to âabandon missile-defense programs with Polandâ without seeming to realize that last April Warsaw announced it awarded an $8 billion contact on missile defense to Raytheon. Nor did he seem cognizant of the newly announced European Reassurance Initiative, a $3.4 billion program that will, among other things, fund a âpersistent rotational presence of air, land, and sea forces in Central and Eastern Europe for training.â		
And what would be a major foreign-policy address in Washington without a mention of Israel? Trump declared that President Obama has ânot been a friendâ to Israel, even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâno fan of Obamaâsaid in March 2013 that the president has supported Israelâs right to exist âmore than any other president.â		
Later in the speech, perhaps unintentionally evoking Nixonâs âmadman theory,â Trump declared that, as regards foreign relations, âwe have to be unpredictable.â This, and much else besides, raises the question: Whoâs advising this guy? It would be hard to believe, given the content of the speech, that the realists of the National Interest are informing Trumpâs foreign-policy vision.		
Yet it wasn’t all terrible.		
Trump quite correctly noted that NATO allies are basically a group of free riders. Only four of 28 member states are spending the agreed-upon 2 percent minimum of GDP on defense. He also rightly castigated President Obama and Secretary Clinton for pursing policies that have further destabilized the Middle East.		
Notably, he declared that âwe are not bound to be adversariesâ with either Russia or China. Relations with the two great powers should be âbased on shared interests.â Trump noted that one of those shared interests is fighting terrorism; Russia, he said, âhas seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.â The idea that the United States and Russia actually have some common interests must have cheered the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, who was watching from the front row.		
Nevertheless, the speech was, on balance, a confused and muddled effort. And yet, what does it say that it was less hawkish than anything the presumptive Democratic nominee has said on foreign policy thus far?

He also rightly castigated President Obama and Secretary Clinton for pursing policies that have further destabilized the Middle East.		
Notably, he declared that âwe are not bound to be adversariesâ with either Russia or China. Relations with the two great powers should be âbased on shared interests.â Trump noted that one of those shared interests is fighting terrorism; Russia, he said, âhas seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.â The idea that the United States and Russia actually have some common interests must have cheered the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, who was watching from the front row.		
Nevertheless, the speech was, on balance, a confused and muddled effort. And yet, what does it say that it was less hawkish than anything the presumptive Democratic nominee has said on foreign policy thus far?

Yeah, but is he any worse than Hillary? I don&apos;t think so.

"...ï»¿ what does it say that it was less hawkish than anything the presumptive Democratic nominee has said on foreign policy thus far?" It says what many DEMOCRATS have been saying in primaries--that said presumptive nominee is frightening, out of touch, shameless, Thatcherite and, quite simply, not what they want. No, not enough Democratic primary voters have said that. But when one considers where Senator Sanders was and were Ms. Clinton was when the primacy competition began and where they are now, it really is clear who has "won" the competition of ideas, character and vision. Pity, ENORMOUS pity, that he has also not won the competition for votes.

Donald Trump has compared his own situation in the Republican Party, to Sanders&apos; situation in the Democratic Party.  Could it be Trump has been listening to  "BERNIE&apos;S GREATEST HITS" and picking his own favorite proverbial "songs" for his campaign?  Possibly.

Like all progressives, I felt the Bern years ago, but also like most progressive, I remained morally blind to the countless atrocities overseas that Obama and Clinton committed, as well as thousands of stories of solitary confinement, nightmarish scenarios of immigrant detention and brutality by rogue cops and prison guards.  There was no initiative for reforms of these by the administration.   Only when the alternative media and true progressive pointed out these  atrocities, did the establishment Democrats act as if they were involved.  This administration was out of touch with the water crisis in Flint for two years.  They could have ordered the EPA to distribute home water filters.  They did nothing until the media blitz about it.  The collusion of Big Business and government is defined as fascism.  I do not want to be associated with this party, that supported toppling democratically elected leaders in Ukraine and Honduras, and the violent removal of a "cooperative" [with American security agencies] dictator in North Africa, destabilizing the region.  The list goes on. Trump is not any more a disaster than Obama and Hillary.  They are good on some issues, and we all know what they are.  I&apos;m sorry but the Democratic establishment has no moral authority to criticize anyone, on left or right.  The party has been lost to Big Business.  I have no passion for Trump, but if Sanders does not have the opportunity to reform the Democratic party, then Trump, unintentionally, may be able to indirectly reform both parties.  On the right, he would push the party to the Left on some issue, but most of all he can break the ideological log jam, things like "taking the pledge" on taxes,  and on some social issues.  His big mouth seems less atrocious, when drones are terrorizing goat herders and executing  people, innocent or not, without a trial.  On the left, Clinton&apos;s loss would put the brakes on: The Clinton dynasty; The DLC (Democratic Leadership Conference) which not a "conference" at all, but a 600 members-only, elite party within the party; The super delegate system, which started about the same time as the DLC and Clinton presidency.  So I am philosophical about this.  I cannot identify as a Democrat without a Sanders victory, not in spite of being a progressive, but because I am a progressive.  I will write-in Bernie Sanders, but if Trump can "clean up his act" I may welcome a Trump victory, which will topple both party establishments.

You&apos;d be for a racist misogynist game show host who thinks our economic problems are because the working people make too much money? His policies will all benefit the 1% because he is one of them. Everything is about Trump to him. He is totally ignorant about foreign affairs and I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll get his advise from reasonable people.
