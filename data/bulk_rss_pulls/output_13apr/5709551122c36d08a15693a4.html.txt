John Podesta, Hillary Clintonâs campaign chairman, says itâs time for the U.S. government to release any evidence it has about the existence of alien forms of life in outer space.

Podesta, who was also aÂ chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, told CNN thatÂ if Hillary Clinton is elected, sheâll ask for as many records about Area 51 in Nevada as the U.S. government has to be declassified.

âI think that's a commitment that she intends to keep and that I intend to hold her to," Podesta told CNN.

Area 51 is a remote Air Force test and training range thatâs been the subject of conspiracy theories, including UFO sightings.

"The U.S. government could do a much better job in answering the quite legitimate questions that people have about what's going on with unidentified aerial phenomena," said Podesta.

Asked if the government is holding proof of alien life, Podesta said: âThatâs for the public to judge once theyâve seen all the evidence that the U.S. government has.â

Asked about his own beliefs, Podesta simply said: âThere are a lot of planets out there,â adding âthe American people can handle the truth.â
