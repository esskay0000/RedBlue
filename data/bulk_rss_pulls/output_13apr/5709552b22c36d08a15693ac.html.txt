On Thursday, John Kasich once again scarfed down Italian food on the campaign trail, this time at Mike's Deli in New York City's Bronx borough.

And while the Ohio governor drew controversy last week for eating pizza with a fork, Thursday's appearance saw him plow throughÂ a veritable journey of Italian cuisine.

According toÂ Business Insider, Kasich ate:

â¢ Two plates of spaghetti bolognese
â¢ A sandwich of his own design,Â The J.K. Special, including salami, provolone, mozzarella, pickles and hot peppers
â¢Â Pasta fagioli with cheese
â¢Â A bit of antipastoÂ from someone else's plate

He also drank some wine and orderedÂ cannoli to go.

"Mamma mia!" Kasich proclaimed.

Come, dear reader, and join John Kasich on this journey:

"Mama mia!"Â â John Kasich, governor of Ohio

And now, dear friends, the journey is complete. Bask in the glory of John Kasich's full stomach.

Astute followers of Kasich's culinary exploits will recall the governor ate three pork chops, beans, an ear of corn and ice cream at last year's Iowa State Fair. Did Kasich top that on Thursday? You decide.

And if you want seconds, here's a whole gallery of John Kasich eating pizza.
