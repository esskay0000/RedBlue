Bernie Sanders won again Saturday â and still lost.

The Vermont senator took Â­Wyoming by an impressive 12 percentage-point margin in statewide caucuses, beating Clinton 56-44 percent.

But under the Democratic partyâs oddball delegate system, Sandersâ winning streak â he has won seven out of the past eight contests â counts for little.

In fact, despite his win, he splits the Wyomingâs 14 pledged delegates 7 to 7 under the caucus calculus.

Clinton, meanwhile, also gets the stateâs four superdelegates â who already pledged their allegiance to her in January. So despite âlosing,â she triumphs 11-7 in the delegate tally.

Of the 500 superdelegates who have announced whom theyâre supporting, 469 say theyâre for Clinton.

That makes Sandersâ win in the Cowboy State and in caucuses and primaries across the country little more than a morale boost â and maybe a cruel joke to his Â­ardent young supporters.

Meanwhile, both candidates turned their attentions to New Yorkâs April 19 primary, and its trove of 291 delegates.

In city appearances, Clinton shied away from a slice of Juniorâs cheesecake and Brooklyn-born Sanders touted his borough bona fides.

âI hope that New York state will help lead this country into the political revolution,â the Vermont senator told a cheering crowd of 700 mostly Hispanic and black voters at the United Palace of Cultural Arts in Washington Heights.

The crowd booed when Sanders said that New York is âSecretary Clintonâs adopted home state.â

âThatâs not a crime,â Sanders joked in response.

âSo if we can win here, it opens the door to victory to the White House,â he said, saying that a high voter turnout on April 19, when New Yorkâs 291 delegates will be allocated, could vault him past the front-runner. Current polling averages have Clinton in the lead in New York by 13 points.

âThis primary is so critical,â Clinton said at an âorganizing eventâ that drew about 250 supporters to Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

âWe are two and a half million votes ahead [of Sanders], we are on the path to the nomination,â she said. âI need to win big in New York â the sooner I become the nominee, the sooner we can unify the Democratic Party and go after the Republicans full on.â

Actress Susan Sarandon introduced Sanders at a rally of 400 jumping, screaming voters in The Bronx, and actor Kal Penn spoke for him in Washington Heights and at a LaGuardia Community College event in Long Island City.

Midway through his speech there â which drew a rowdy crowd of more than 1,000 â Sandersâ wife, Jane, interrupted him to whisper that the senator had won the Wyoming caucuses.

âThe Clinton campaign is getting very nervous because we won seven out of eight of the last contests,â Sanders told the crowd.

âEquality, hope, young hearts. He is for the people who are still dreaming, the young ones,â said Paco Lugovina, 77, of The Bronx.

Lugovina said he has donated $90 to the Sanders campaign in $10 and $15 increments.

The crowds chanted slogans like âWe have Bernie Sandersâ back! We donât need Super PACs!â and carried signs. One, waved by a 5-year-old girl, read: âI trust Bernie with my future.â

Kiara Mendez, 47, of Washington Heights, said Sandersâ speech âwas beautiful. He says all the truth. We believe in him.â

At The Landing, an industrial-chic space in Brooklynâs Industry City, Clinton boosters lined up two hours ahead of the event, while protesters outside the venue shouted angry slogans. âSunset Park is not for sale.â

âHillary is purposely trying to gentrify this community,â one opponent said. âThis will take away jobs from minorities and colored people.â

âI like Hillary. She is experienced domestically and abroad,â said Joey Wasserman, who attended the Sunset Park event. âShe is charismatic.â

âI am here because I am on the fence about Hillary Clinton,â said Brian, a graduate student. âI want to get her candor, her vision, and her voice about certain issues. I want to get a better sense of who she is.â

Earlier in the day, Clinton visited Juniorâs in Brooklyn with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and City Councilwoman Laurie Cumbo â without sampling the world-famous cheesecake.

âI learned early on not to eat in front of all of you,â she told reporters. âSo I am sitting here just pining, pining for a bite.â
