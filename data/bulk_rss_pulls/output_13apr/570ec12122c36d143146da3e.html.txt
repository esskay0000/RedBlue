Vladimir Putin fans now have theÂ perfect place to toast to the Russian leader thanks to a newly opened cafeÂ dedicated solely to the action man president.

Welcome to the incredibly patriotic President Cafe in eastern Siberia, located around 4,000 km (2,500 miles)Â from Moscow, where Putinâs face covers the walls and Barack Obamaâs smiling face is on the toilet paper.

Graffiti-daubed pictures of Obama, as well as David Cameron and his German counterpart Angela Merkel, also greet visitors to the toilet - with floor mats featuring US flag adding to the anti-Western vibe.

Visitors can also pose for photos with a life-size picture of the Russian leader at the bar which opened last month in the working-class city of Krasnoyarsk, Reuters reports.

Dozens of Putin photos hang proudly from the walls of the eatery, documenting his journey from childhood to the Kremlin.

Dmitry Zhdanov, a 26-year-old entrepreneur and co-owner of the business, insists he does not hate the West, explaining: âI am neutral towards Western politicians. This is just business, nothing personal.â

âWhen we got together with partners to open a new cafe, we thought of a concept that would attract customers and guarantee its success,â he said.

âAnd it then dawned on us: Russia still had no cafe or restaurant fully dedicated to Putin, Russia's most popular politician! This is how our concept appeared. Then we worked on the design.â

He added: âPeople react the way they consider appropriate, and we give them this opportunityâ¦But, in general, we see this as entertainment.â

In December, Putin was given quite possibly the ultimate honour bestowed on anyone ever after an artist created a life-size chocolate version of the Russian president.

Russian officials were previously trolled themselves, on Twitter, when Canadian diplomats sent them a helpful map and geography lesson offer in the row over Crimea.
