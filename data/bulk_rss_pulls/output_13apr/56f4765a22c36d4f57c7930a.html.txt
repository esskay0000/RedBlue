The war of words between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz heated up Thursday as Cruz called Trump a âsniveling cowardâ after the billionaire tweeted an attack on the Texas senatorâs wife.

âI donât get angry often, but you mess with my wife,you mess with my kids, thatâll do it everytime.â Cruz said at a Wisconsin factory. âDonald, youâre a sniveling coward, leave Heidi the hell alone.â

The fiery reaction from Cruz comes after Trump retweeted an image late Wednesday from a supporter which contrasted a picture of Trumpâs wife Melania alongside an unflattering image of Cruzâs wife Heidi, with the caption âa picture is worth a thousand words.â

When asked if he would support Trump if he became the nominee, Cruz said âIâm going to beat him for the nominationâ¦Donald Trump is not going to be the nominee.â

The latest spat over their wives came after Trump objected this week to a Facebook ad targeted to Mormons in Utah that showed Melania posing nude with the caption: âMeet Melania Trump, your next first lady. Or you could vote for Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â

Although the ad was produced by anti-Trump Super PAC âMake America Awesome,â which has no connection to the Cruz campaign, the real estate mogul responded by tweeting Tuesday that Cruz should âbe carefulâ or he would âspill the beans on your wife.â

Cruz responded on Twitter by saying that the ad was not from him and if he went after his wife, then Trump is a "coward."

"Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless," Cruz tweeted.

On Wednesday, Cruz reiterated he had no affiliation with the super PAC but added that Trumpâs bad behavior may have been the result of a âbad night in Utah.â
