An emotional group hug led Sen. Ted Cruz to inadvertently elbow his wife, Heidi, in the face moments after dropping out of the Republican presidential contest Tuesday night.

Video from the moments after the Indianapolis speech appears to show Ted Cruz accidently brushing Heidi's nose with his hand and then elbowing her in the cheek as he moved to put an arm around his father, Rafael.

The moment is being buzzed about on social media.

The Texas senator left the contest after losing the GOP primary in Indiana, making it nearly impossible to wrestle the party nomination away from front-runner Donald Trump.
