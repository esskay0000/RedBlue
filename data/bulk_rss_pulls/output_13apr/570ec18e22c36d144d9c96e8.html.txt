New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has "got a lot of nerve" for criticizing Ted Cruz, according to a new radio spot running in New York. The ad, from the Cruz campaign, is an extension of the candidate's run-against-liberal-New-York strategy -- a strategy that began when he started bashing Donald Trump's "New York values" and is culminating in his attempt to peel conservative votes away from Trump in the state.

To that end, de Blasio is a convenient foil, an embodiment of the New York values that Cruz so despises. (Cruz will spend Monday in the city at the midtown Harvard Club, raising money from Wall Street types.) In 2012, Mitt Romney couldn't have run against New York's mayor, since it was Michael Bloomberg, who until 2007 was a Republican himself. With the left-leaning de Blasio in the mayor's mansion, though, Cruz can run through a lengthy condemnation of de Blasio's record.

It's a good ad for the target audience. It also contains a number of bad or misleading points.

First and foremost is the claim that murder "is up nearly 10 percent" under de Blasio. As our Wesley Lowery noted, that's simply not true.

Data from the FBI and the New York Police Department shows that murders have been essentially flat under de Blasio. Over the last two years of the Bloomberg administration, the number of murders in the city were 419 and 335, respectively. Under the first two years of de Blasio? 333 and 348. The latter is a slight uptick of 4.5 percent -- but that's nowhere near 10 percent. (Under Bloomberg, the murder rate did spike 10 percent twice, between 2005 and 2006 and between 2009 and 2010.) If you compare the number of murders in 2015 to the number when Bloomberg left office, the rate only rose 3.9 percent.



NYPD data shows that this year, murders are down so far. During the most recent week for which data was available, murders were down 75 percent over 2015. For the most recent month, they're down 4.3 percent. And year-to-date, murders are down by a fifth.

The ad also claims that de Blasio "ended stop-and-frisk, even where terror suspects are known to congregate." This is a combination of two different issues that resonate with Republican voters.

The first is the policy of stop-and-frisk that was rampant under Michael Bloomberg. In essence, New York cops implemented a policy by which people could be detained or searched on very limited (or essentially nonexistent) evidence. De Blasio campaigned against stop-and-frisk, which a court declared unconstitutional in 2013 -- that is, under Bloomberg. Bloomberg began an appeal, but de Blasio's administration dropped it.

Bloomberg also oversaw NYPD surveillance of mosques and other places where Muslims living in the city shopped and lived. Earlier this year, Cruz championed bringing a version of that program to the rest of the country, despite the NYPD saying that it didn't work. The program was ended under de Blasio -- in part because there were no "terror suspects" that were uncovered congregating anywhere.

To some extent, Cruz's ad goes farther than it even needed to. De Blasio is not popular among Republicans, with three-quarters viewing him negatively, according to a January Quinnipiac University poll. That de Blasio dislikes Cruz should be about all Cruz needed to make his point. Instead, he bent the truth and made up data.

Takes a lot of nerve.
