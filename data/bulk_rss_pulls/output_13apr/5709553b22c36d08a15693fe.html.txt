There arenât a lot of certainties left in the US presidential race, but hereâs one thing about which we can be absolutely sure: The Clinton camp really doesnât like talking about fossil-fuel money. Last week, when a young Greenpeace campaigner challenged Hillary Clinton about taking money from fossil-fuel companies, the candidate accused the Bernie Sanders campaign of âlyingâ and declared herself âso sickâ of it. As the exchange went viral, a succession of high-powered Clinton supporters pronounced that there was nothing to see here and that everyone should move along.

						});
					
The very suggestion that taking this money could impact Clintonâs actions is âbaseless and should stop,â according to California Senator Barbara Boxer. Itâs âflat-out false,â âinappropriate,â and doesnât âhold water,â declared New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman went so far as to issue âguidelines for good and bad behaviorâ for the Sanders camp. The first guideline? Cut out the âinnuendo suggesting, without evidence, that Clinton is corrupt.â				
					
					
Thatâs a whole lot of firepower to slap down a non-issue. So is it an issue or not?				
					
					
First, some facts. Hillary Clintonâs campaign, including her Super PAC, has received a lot of money from the employees and registered lobbyists of fossil-fuel companies. Thereâs the much-cited $4.5 million that Greenpeace calculated, which includes bundling by lobbyists.				
			

							One of Clinton’s most active financial backers is Warren Buffett, who is up to his eyeballs in coal.
						
 
But thatâs not all. There is also a lot more money from sources not included in those calculations. For instance, one of Clintonâs most prominent and active financial backers is Warren Buffett. While he owns a large mix of assets, Buffett is up to his eyeballs in coal, including coal transportation and some of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country.				
					
					
Then thereâs all the cash that fossil-fuel companies have directly pumped into the Clinton Foundation. In recent years, Exxon, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron have all contributed to the foundation. An investigation in the International Business Times just revealed that at least two of these oil companies were part of an effort to lobby Clintonâs State Department about the Alberta tar sands, a massive deposit of extra-dirty oil. Leading climate scientists like James Hansen have explained that if we donât keep the vast majority of that carbon in the ground, we will unleash catastrophic levels of warming.				
					
					
During this period, the investigation found, Clintonâs State Department approved the Alberta Clipper, a controversial pipeline carrying large amounts of tar-sands bitumen from Alberta to Wisconsin. âAccording to federal lobbying records reviewed by the IBT,â write David Sirota and Ned Resnikoff, âChevron and ConocoPhillips both lobbied the State Department specifically on the issue of âoil sandsâ in the immediate months prior to the departmentâs approval, as did a trade association funded by ExxonMobil.â

Did the donations to the Clinton Foundation have anything to do with the State Departmentâs pipeline decision? Did they make Hillary Clinton more disposed to seeing tar-sands pipelines as environmentally benign, as early State Department reviews of Keystone XL seemed to conclude, despite the many scientific warnings? There is no proofâno âsmoking gun,â as Clinton defenders like to say. Just as there is no proof that the money her campaign took from gas lobbyists and fracking financiers has shaped Clintonâs current (and dangerous) view that fracking can be made safe.				
					
					
Itâs important to recognize that Clintonâs campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donorsâwhich is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate changeâdenying Republicans.				
					
					
Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So itâs very good that the Sanders camp isnât abiding by Krugmanâs âguidelines for good behaviorâ and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isnât over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time.				
					
					
Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the âso sickâ response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clintonâs claim that young people âdonât do their own research,â Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!:				
					
					
As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the futureâ¦. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youthâthe people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problemâare incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And thatâs why weâre out thereâ¦asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isnât going to continue things as theyâve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.

							});
						

Resnick-Dayâs words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clintonâs web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a âsmoking gun.â Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. As Resnick-Day correctly states, everything is moving faster than the scientific modeling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster.				
					
					
And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century âincluding New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it outâthen we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon starting next year.				
					
					
That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planetâfossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.				
			

							The real issue is not Clinton’s corporate cash; it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology.
						
 
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything sheâs built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isnât Clintonâs corporate cash, itâs her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.				
					
					
To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation at which Hillary Clinton works and which bears her family name. The mission of the Clinton Foundation can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatization frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president), that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.

So letâs forget the smoking guns for the moment. The problem with Clinton World is structural. Itâs the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationshipsâlubricated by the exchange of money, favors, status, and media attentionâshape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.				
					
					
For instance, under the Clintonsâ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India (just donât mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, weâre still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).				
					
					
In Clinton World itâs always win-win-win: The governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: The Clintons grow ever more powerful.				
			

							At the center of it all is the belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy, but by partnering with them.
						
 
At the center of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed âthe land of money,â all of Hillary Clintonâs most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? Itâs not a conflict of interest; itâs a mutually beneficial partnershipâpart of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.				
					
					
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of pollutersâbecause, we were told, emission reductions needed to be âwin-winâ and âmarket-friendly.â				
					
					
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If weâre to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many âwinsâ: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.				
					
					
Bernie Sandersâs campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.				
			

							Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win.
						
 
Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: It wonât all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for many decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; theyâll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollarsâ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.				
					
					
Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility billsâbut once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffettâs coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).				
					
					
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the centuryâand absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment.				
					
					
The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isnât following anyoneâs guidelines for good behavior.

And thatâs why weâre out thereâ¦asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isnât going to continue things as theyâve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.

Resnick-Dayâs words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clintonâs web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a âsmoking gun.â Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. As Resnick-Day correctly states, everything is moving faster than the scientific modeling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster.				
					
					
And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century âincluding New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it outâthen we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon starting next year.				
					
					
That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planetâfossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.				
			

							The real issue is not Clinton’s corporate cash; it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology.
						
 
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything sheâs built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isnât Clintonâs corporate cash, itâs her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.				
					
					
To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation at which Hillary Clinton works and which bears her family name. The mission of the Clinton Foundation can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatization frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president), that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.

So letâs forget the smoking guns for the moment. The problem with Clinton World is structural. Itâs the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationshipsâlubricated by the exchange of money, favors, status, and media attentionâshape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.				
					
					
For instance, under the Clintonsâ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India (just donât mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, weâre still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).				
					
					
In Clinton World itâs always win-win-win: The governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: The Clintons grow ever more powerful.				
			

							At the center of it all is the belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy, but by partnering with them.
						
 
At the center of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed âthe land of money,â all of Hillary Clintonâs most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? Itâs not a conflict of interest; itâs a mutually beneficial partnershipâpart of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.				
					
					
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of pollutersâbecause, we were told, emission reductions needed to be âwin-winâ and âmarket-friendly.â				
					
					
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If weâre to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many âwinsâ: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.				
					
					
Bernie Sandersâs campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.				
			

							Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win.
						
 
Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: It wonât all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for many decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; theyâll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollarsâ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.				
					
					
Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility billsâbut once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffettâs coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).				
					
					
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the centuryâand absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment.				
					
					
The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isnât following anyoneâs guidelines for good behavior.				
					
					
		

First, some facts. Hillary Clintonâs campaign, including her Super PAC, has received a lot of money from the employees and registered lobbyists of fossil-fuel companies. Thereâs the much-cited $4.5 million that Greenpeace calculated, which includes bundling by lobbyists.				
			

							One of Clinton’s most active financial backers is Warren Buffett, who is up to his eyeballs in coal.
						
 
But thatâs not all. There is also a lot more money from sources not included in those calculations. For instance, one of Clintonâs most prominent and active financial backers is Warren Buffett. While he owns a large mix of assets, Buffett is up to his eyeballs in coal, including coal transportation and some of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country.				
					
					
Then thereâs all the cash that fossil-fuel companies have directly pumped into the Clinton Foundation. In recent years, Exxon, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron have all contributed to the foundation. An investigation in the International Business Times just revealed that at least two of these oil companies were part of an effort to lobby Clintonâs State Department about the Alberta tar sands, a massive deposit of extra-dirty oil. Leading climate scientists like James Hansen have explained that if we donât keep the vast majority of that carbon in the ground, we will unleash catastrophic levels of warming.				
					
					
During this period, the investigation found, Clintonâs State Department approved the Alberta Clipper, a controversial pipeline carrying large amounts of tar-sands bitumen from Alberta to Wisconsin. âAccording to federal lobbying records reviewed by the IBT,â write David Sirota and Ned Resnikoff, âChevron and ConocoPhillips both lobbied the State Department specifically on the issue of âoil sandsâ in the immediate months prior to the departmentâs approval, as did a trade association funded by ExxonMobil.â

Did the donations to the Clinton Foundation have anything to do with the State Departmentâs pipeline decision? Did they make Hillary Clinton more disposed to seeing tar-sands pipelines as environmentally benign, as early State Department reviews of Keystone XL seemed to conclude, despite the many scientific warnings? There is no proofâno âsmoking gun,â as Clinton defenders like to say. Just as there is no proof that the money her campaign took from gas lobbyists and fracking financiers has shaped Clintonâs current (and dangerous) view that fracking can be made safe.				
					
					
Itâs important to recognize that Clintonâs campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donorsâwhich is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate changeâdenying Republicans.				
					
					
Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So itâs very good that the Sanders camp isnât abiding by Krugmanâs âguidelines for good behaviorâ and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isnât over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time.				
					
					
Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the âso sickâ response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clintonâs claim that young people âdonât do their own research,â Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!:				
					
					
As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the futureâ¦. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youthâthe people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problemâare incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And thatâs why weâre out thereâ¦asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isnât going to continue things as theyâve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.

They will have to leave trillions of dollarsâ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.				
					
					
Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility billsâbut once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffettâs coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).				
					
					
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the centuryâand absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment.				
					
					
The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isnât following anyoneâs guidelines for good behavior.				
					
					
		

Then thereâs all the cash that fossil-fuel companies have directly pumped into the Clinton Foundation. In recent years, Exxon, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron have all contributed to the foundation. An investigation in the International Business Times just revealed that at least two of these oil companies were part of an effort to lobby Clintonâs State Department about the Alberta tar sands, a massive deposit of extra-dirty oil. Leading climate scientists like James Hansen have explained that if we donât keep the vast majority of that carbon in the ground, we will unleash catastrophic levels of warming.				
					
					
During this period, the investigation found, Clintonâs State Department approved the Alberta Clipper, a controversial pipeline carrying large amounts of tar-sands bitumen from Alberta to Wisconsin. âAccording to federal lobbying records reviewed by the IBT,â write David Sirota and Ned Resnikoff, âChevron and ConocoPhillips both lobbied the State Department specifically on the issue of âoil sandsâ in the immediate months prior to the departmentâs approval, as did a trade association funded by ExxonMobil.â

Did the donations to the Clinton Foundation have anything to do with the State Departmentâs pipeline decision? Did they make Hillary Clinton more disposed to seeing tar-sands pipelines as environmentally benign, as early State Department reviews of Keystone XL seemed to conclude, despite the many scientific warnings? There is no proofâno âsmoking gun,â as Clinton defenders like to say. Just as there is no proof that the money her campaign took from gas lobbyists and fracking financiers has shaped Clintonâs current (and dangerous) view that fracking can be made safe.				
					
					
Itâs important to recognize that Clintonâs campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donorsâwhich is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate changeâdenying Republicans.				
					
					
Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So itâs very good that the Sanders camp isnât abiding by Krugmanâs âguidelines for good behaviorâ and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isnât over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time.				
					
					
Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the âso sickâ response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clintonâs claim that young people âdonât do their own research,â Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!:				
					
					
As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the futureâ¦. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youthâthe people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problemâare incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And thatâs why weâre out thereâ¦asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isnât going to continue things as theyâve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.

							});
						

Resnick-Dayâs words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clintonâs web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a âsmoking gun.â Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. As Resnick-Day correctly states, everything is moving faster than the scientific modeling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster.				
					
					
And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century âincluding New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it outâthen we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon starting next year.				
					
					
That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planetâfossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.				
			

							The real issue is not Clinton’s corporate cash; it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology.
						
 
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything sheâs built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isnât Clintonâs corporate cash, itâs her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.				
					
					
To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation at which Hillary Clinton works and which bears her family name. The mission of the Clinton Foundation can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatization frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president), that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.

So letâs forget the smoking guns for the moment. The problem with Clinton World is structural. Itâs the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationshipsâlubricated by the exchange of money, favors, status, and media attentionâshape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.				
					
					
For instance, under the Clintonsâ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India (just donât mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, weâre still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).				
					
					
In Clinton World itâs always win-win-win: The governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: The Clintons grow ever more powerful.				
			

							At the center of it all is the belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy, but by partnering with them.
						
 
At the center of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed âthe land of money,â all of Hillary Clintonâs most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? Itâs not a conflict of interest; itâs a mutually beneficial partnershipâpart of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.				
					
					
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of pollutersâbecause, we were told, emission reductions needed to be âwin-winâ and âmarket-friendly.â				
					
					
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If weâre to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many âwinsâ: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.				
					
					
Bernie Sandersâs campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.				
			

							Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win.
						
 
Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: It wonât all be win-win.

Itâs not a conflict of interest; itâs a mutually beneficial partnershipâpart of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.				
					
					
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of pollutersâbecause, we were told, emission reductions needed to be âwin-winâ and âmarket-friendly.â				
					
					
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If weâre to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many âwinsâ: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.				
					
					
Bernie Sandersâs campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.				
			

							Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win.
						
 
Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: It wonât all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for many decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; theyâll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollarsâ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.				
					
					
Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility billsâbut once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffettâs coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).				
					
					
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the centuryâand absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment.				
					
					
The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isnât following anyoneâs guidelines for good behavior.				
					
					
		

Itâs important to recognize that Clintonâs campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donorsâwhich is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate changeâdenying Republicans.				
					
					
Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So itâs very good that the Sanders camp isnât abiding by Krugmanâs âguidelines for good behaviorâ and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isnât over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time.				
					
					
Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the âso sickâ response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clintonâs claim that young people âdonât do their own research,â Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!:				
					
					
As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the futureâ¦. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youthâthe people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problemâare incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And thatâs why weâre out thereâ¦asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isnât going to continue things as theyâve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.

							});
						

Resnick-Dayâs words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clintonâs web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a âsmoking gun.â Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. As Resnick-Day correctly states, everything is moving faster than the scientific modeling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster.				
					
					
And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century âincluding New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it outâthen we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon starting next year.				
					
					
That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planetâfossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.				
			

							The real issue is not Clinton’s corporate cash; it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology.
						
 
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything sheâs built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isnât Clintonâs corporate cash, itâs her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.				
					
					
To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation at which Hillary Clinton works and which bears her family name. The mission of the Clinton Foundation can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatization frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president), that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.

So letâs forget the smoking guns for the moment. The problem with Clinton World is structural. Itâs the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationshipsâlubricated by the exchange of money, favors, status, and media attentionâshape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.				
					
					
For instance, under the Clintonsâ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India (just donât mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, weâre still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).				
					
					
In Clinton World itâs always win-win-win: The governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: The Clintons grow ever more powerful.

Resnick-Dayâs words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clintonâs web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a âsmoking gun.â Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. As Resnick-Day correctly states, everything is moving faster than the scientific modeling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster.				
					
					
And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century âincluding New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it outâthen we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon starting next year.				
					
					
That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planetâfossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.				
			

							The real issue is not Clinton’s corporate cash; it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology.
						
 
While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything sheâs built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isnât Clintonâs corporate cash, itâs her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.				
					
					
To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation at which Hillary Clinton works and which bears her family name. The mission of the Clinton Foundation can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatization frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president), that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.

So letâs forget the smoking guns for the moment. The problem with Clinton World is structural. Itâs the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationshipsâlubricated by the exchange of money, favors, status, and media attentionâshape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.				
					
					
For instance, under the Clintonsâ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India (just donât mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, weâre still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).				
					
					
In Clinton World itâs always win-win-win: The governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: The Clintons grow ever more powerful.				
			

							At the center of it all is the belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy, but by partnering with them.
						
 
At the center of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed âthe land of money,â all of Hillary Clintonâs most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? Itâs not a conflict of interest; itâs a mutually beneficial partnershipâpart of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.				
					
					
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of pollutersâbecause, we were told, emission reductions needed to be âwin-winâ and âmarket-friendly.â				
					
					
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If weâre to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many âwinsâ: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.				
					
					
Bernie Sandersâs campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.				
			

							Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win.
						
 
Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: It wonât all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for many decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; theyâll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollarsâ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.				
					
					
Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility billsâbut once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffettâs coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).				
					
					
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the centuryâand absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment.				
					
					
The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isnât following anyoneâs guidelines for good behavior.

Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility billsâbut once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffettâs coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar).				
					
					
A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the centuryâand absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment.				
					
					
The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isnât following anyoneâs guidelines for good behavior.				
					
					
		

So letâs forget the smoking guns for the moment. The problem with Clinton World is structural. Itâs the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationshipsâlubricated by the exchange of money, favors, status, and media attentionâshape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.				
					
					
For instance, under the Clintonsâ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India (just donât mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, weâre still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).				
					
					
In Clinton World itâs always win-win-win: The governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: The Clintons grow ever more powerful.				
			

							At the center of it all is the belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy, but by partnering with them.
						
 
At the center of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed âthe land of money,â all of Hillary Clintonâs most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? Itâs not a conflict of interest; itâs a mutually beneficial partnershipâpart of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.				
					
					
Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of pollutersâbecause, we were told, emission reductions needed to be âwin-winâ and âmarket-friendly.â				
					
					
If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If weâre to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many âwinsâ: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.				
					
					
Bernie Sandersâs campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.

If you demand this "Berning" standard. WHO will be left in the Democratic Party? As I remember, Obama raised millions from PACs, as did most of the successful candidates. Are we to unilaterally disarm in the name of "purity"?

Perhaps The Bern should consider the advice of Jess Unruh (D.-Ca)
" "If you can&apos;t take their money, drink their booze, eat their food, screw their women and vote against them, you don&apos;t belong here."

Great article, clearly states why so many people do not want Billary shoved down our throats. She would be a disaster for the country.

It&apos;s way too late for the Hillary apologists to be arguing for her as POTUS.  We just lived through the hottest year in known history. Because of the Porter Ranch natural gas leak in Southern California, one of the warmest areas of the US may experience up to 14 days of power blackout this coming summer. Multiply this by pollution from fracking and other fossil fuel fallout and the future on the planet appears very uncomfortable, indeed!

Oh, please. Your purity tests are ridiculous. Should she misunderstand corporations, given that most people work for them. Your article and these comments reek of entitlement. Furthermore, Obama isn&apos;t any different!

You&apos;re right. Obama accepted considerable money from corporate bundlers, too. Particularly $1,034,615 from Goldman Sachs. We&apos;ve also seen no jail time issued to any Wall Street types who contributed to the 2008 crash by bundling bad mortgages and then sold them as AAA-rate product under his administration. Like Klein said: sometimes you don&apos;t need a quid pro quo document proclaiming guilt. Sometimes the circumstance is enough to put you off.  Well, most of us, anyway.

You are entirely right: Obama was a mainstream president, beholden to special interests and the profit and power of the mega corporations. If any proof is needed, then surely, the TPP, negotiated by Obama and designed to corporative the world, is it.

I forgot to mention that trashing the Clinton Foundation is absurd. Yes, helping women and children across the globe is such a bad thing when she doesn&apos;t do it your way. In your worldview nothing other than socialism is a negative worldview.

While the Clinton foundation is certainly using all the money they get for charitable purposes, the foundation as a whole is still a political entity. Here is a link that shows the connections pretty clearly:
http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/01/30/clinton-system-donor-machine-2016-election/

The Clinton Foundation is a method to launder money to the Clinton Family.

I  meant nothing in your worldview other than socialism is acceptable. I would hate for the language police to come after my.

Dadblast it, Klein. Now I&apos;ve had to go and buy a 6-month digital subscription because this piece hit such a hard chord.  Hope you&apos;re bloody happy.

The election of Sanders is only Step One. Without sweeping down-ballot victories, we&apos;re just looking at another four years of an intransigent lobbyist-owned congress. When Sanders calls for a revolution, he means just that! Anyone who thinks these plutocrats will just shuffle into the sunset are dreaming. Buckle up for a long and nefarious fight.

Secretary Clinton signed the &apos;Monsanto Protection Act&apos;. If their Chemicals and GMOs are safe then why do they need FEDERAL PROTECTION? She is an opportunist and I support Sanders.

Some more of the Clinton world view - things she (as do neo-conservatives and neo-liberals) support:
 
 (1) Terrifying drones perpetuating war and the cycle of violence in other peoples&apos; lands; 

(2)  Promoting the Ukrainian coup, which installed a $Billionaire president for the country; 

(3) Supporting [perhaps initiating] the Honduran coup of 2009 (never called it a coup) apparently to push mining interests and a dam  project, that nobody wants except capital markets.  The U.S. State Dept. passively approves the gruesome  coup-installed dictatorship.  U.S.  funds the military âgovernmentâ so  American corporations can  make more fast money.

(4) Blundering with an attempted "democratic" revolution in   Lybia,  naively proliferating heavy arms and ammo all over North Africa, and CIA no longer knows where those arms are.

(5) Sent  $11 Billion worth of war planes and bombs to Saudis, which the Saudis are using  to bomb  [Shiite] civilian targets, hospitals,  killing thousands of children, women  and men  in Yemen,  raising tensions with Iran, who give humanitarian support to the Yemini bomb victims. 

(6) Passively supporting, and providing arms to Israel for killing unarmed civilians in  West Bank and Israel,  and Gaza, which has no air defense, except un-guided bottle rockets and tunnels. 

(7) Supporting an ongoing trade embargo of Gaza, which makes it a virtual open-air prison.

Naomi Klein, you nailed it.  If you support the agenda of corporate America, low wages, reduced or removed regulation,  massive wealth shift to the 1%, the Hillary&apos;s your candidate.  HRC likes to pose as a progressive, albeit a pragmatic one, but at her deepest level she is still that Goldwater supporter.  She doesn&apos;t believe that, but her actions speak louder than any of her latest triangulation.

I sure wish the world was full of nice ,honest people but it&apos;s not.Yes there are a lot of REpublicans that are on the take, but just behind them is a lot of Democrats that are accepting bags of money including HRC. The facts are right in front of you yet most  citizens can  not accept them. Bernie might be our last best shot.Maybe in2020 someone else will come along but it will be even harder to effect change. Unless Americans try with all their might now, the 2020 elections might see USA DOA. Maybe its time to think, If you don&apos;t care enought about your kids,relatives, and friends, maybe you should at least care about yourself unless you don&apos;t plan to be around in four years

Thank you for this excellent article, Ms. Klein. It&apos;s funny how vehemently people react when anything critical is said about Hillary Clinton. A negative analysis of some of her stances does not mean we want a Trump or Cruz in office. And it&apos;s so tiresome to hear the media and commenters write off Bernie Sanders. I support him and will until this race is over. It&apos;s so refreshing to have someone honest and trustworthy running for President. Again, thank you for your article.

Yesterday Secretary Clinton stooped to the lowest level  yet in her campaign, and it reeks not only of desperation, but of a hunger for power so strong that it occludes her humanity: "@BernieSanders prioritized gun manufacturers&apos; rights over the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook." The problem remains the MSM and how willing they are to overlook much if not most of the corruption and chicanery that are intrinsic to the Clintons and their long careers at the highest levels. The Republicans will not be so obsequious. In fact, they will dredge up every single shred of baggage and drag it out ad nauseum. Bernie Sanders has such a stellar record and has always been on the progressive side of issues, way before it was popular to be so.

We need to put the Sandy Hook law suit, into a legal, not moral, prospective. I am a parent and what happened at Sandy Hook made me sick and angry. I am a lawyer who has represented injured people for over 30 years. If the guns that were used were legally manufactured and sold to a person legally, the shooters mother, there is no legal basis for suing the manufacturer or the retailer. The number of dead children and adults does not change that. We have to change the laws! If I had my way assault rifles wouldn&apos;t be sold but that is up to the Congress and State Legislatures. Bernie has been against assault rifles forever. An analogy: a man buys a new Chevy legally from a licensed car dealer and gets really drunk and runs a red light while speeding and kills or injures many people. There is no legal basis for suing Chevrolet or the dealer that sold the car, regardless of the multiple dead and injured people caused by the DUI. The bad conduct of the shooter or driver is the cause of the deaths, not the legally purchased product that was wrongfully used. Clinton using these tragic deaths to make political points when there is NO legal basis for a law suit is despicable!

Thank you for stating it so clearly. That is just what Bernie said: there is no way the gun manufacturer can be held responsible for misuse of a legally purchased weapon. Guns kill. They are made to kill by intention and design. 

What was saddest about Hillery&apos;s attack on Sanders is that she approved of a lawsuit that will cost thousands of dollars and that any lawyer would have know is doomed to fail for lack of merit. For Hillary to claim that this lawsuit would fail because of Bernie&apos;s vote for the gun manufacturer is not only a foul political point, but a deliberate attempt to steer people into false lawsuits. Did Hillery advise that the relatives of the dead and the injured of the Boston bombing should sue the pressure pot manufacturer? Nor did she advise that pressure pots should now be limited in sale and only after a background check. Nor in your example did anybody politic suggest that cars should be restricted in sale or forbidden entirely. Yet they cause way more dead in the USA than terrorism and school shootings  combined.

Due to Hillary&apos;s howling on stage it went unnoticed that Bernie&apos;s standpoint is right: if someone buys a gun legally, a manufacturer cannot be sued - or there wouldn&apos;t be any gun manufacturing anymore in the US, as they would spend more on lawsuits than the profit from the guns.

Phelps....Bernie has always been against assult weapons

THANK YOU Ms. Klein you have made the argument that has caused me to back Bernie all the way.  How Hillary supporters cannot see that if you take money from these interests you WILL have to PAY BACK in time.

It isn&apos;t just that you will have to pay back in time. Hillary accepts special interest money because she is on their side to begin with. No conflicts there. They don&apos;t influence her - she is one of them!

Unfortunately I have to agree with you that it is the laws that must be changed.  The DUI argument is sound and some states tried to make it the responsibility of the person that allowed the DUI to get drunk in the first place (the Bar or Restaurant or friend that served him and allowed him to drive).  The real problem is that in most states a DUI is not treated seriously so the person usually is a repeat offender until a death occurs.  This is the same with firearms.  If misuse of firearms was treated seriously it would decline.  If people would also get it through their heads that they DO NOT need an assault rifle to defend their home.  I agree these types of firearms should be banned from public sale.

I think misuse of firearms is treated seriously. You can&apos;t really know misuse until a gun/weapon is used - and then these people get in jail for using a gun without a permit. What needs to change in the US is how parents treat guns in their house. Too many guns are misfired by young children who play with the gun and shoot unwillingly because they don&apos;t know what this object will do. Same with adolescents or young adults who get their hands on the parent or relative&apos;s gun and use it to kill. I think a large part of the problem is inside the families. It is there that things have to change.

I&apos;m a novelist, and I went to graduate school at the University of Arkansas&apos;s MFA program during Bill Clinton&apos;s governorship. I&apos;ve been voting for Clintons for a long time. If HRC is the nominee, I will vote for her in November. But I will do it with diminished enthusiasm for the reasons that Klein so eloquently states in this article.  What both Clintons represented for me thirty or so years ago, they don&apos;t any longer.  I think Clinton will be a solid, status quo president. She will steer a steady course. But she won&apos;t bring corporate America to heel. Perhaps Sanders won&apos;t either, but I am ready to run that risk.

This woman boasts of her relationship with Kissinger, seeks his counsel. What kind of DEMOCRAT does that? The man should be at the Hague, tried as a war criminal. And she embraces him? That alone should disqualify her from the nomination of the Democratic party. Ted Kennedy said it well, "The last thing this country needs is a second Republican party."

I agree with you entirely that Kissinger is a war criminal and belongs in the Hague. But I disagree that any politician could not listen to his view points - that doesn&apos;t mean he/she has to adopt them but it would give him/her a sense of what the extreme view is and then to avoid it.

As a relatively long time subscriber of Nation Magazine, I have supported most of its positions while being a bit reserved on Progressivism.  I find a number of the Progressive positions as goofy as those of the far right â say âTea Partyâ.  I think Ms. Klein and Katrina vanden Heuval are dead wrong about the consequences of supporting Secretary Clinton.  We voters can make her represent our interests by holding her to our values with continued activism. We just canât vote and go home. It makes no sense that Sen. Sanders is the only one able to do that. Keep up the negatives on Secretary Clinton and maybe you can get a Trump, a Cruz or Speaker Paul Ryan, devotee of Ayn Rand, as President.  Geeze!

I think in order for people&apos;s activism to have an effect, president has to have a basic ability to understand and want to serve the people. Hillary doesn&apos;t have that, she serves herself and therefore special interests that serve her quest for power and wealth. No people activism can penetrate that bastion.

You should read Klein&apos;s 2006 book, "The Shock Doctrine."  It is a monumental work of 600 pages and dozens of pages of references and footnotes in the back.  Bound to go down in History as a reference of how U. S. military and trade policies have done so much to put our world in the lethal peril of suffering and death we have today, for the sake of American corporate hegemony.

The time and effort required to repeated "hold her to our values" would be better spent fighting the money interests alongside Bernie.  We cannot convert her.  We would have to fight her on every single issue and we would probably lose more times than we&apos;d win.

Do you really believe that "We voters can make her represent our interests by holding her to our values with continued activism."

How powerful is your activism compared to the millions she has received from Wall Street and the fossil fuel industry, whose positions she supports?

The only money Bernie takes is periodic $30 contributions from people like me.

I am anxious to see who plunks down $353k for the dinner with Hillary George Clooney is hosting in San Francisco.

How can we hold her to our values if we cannot criticize her for not holding to our values?

These lying shills for the Democratic Party like Boxer and Krugman have no credibility with the millions of progressives, including those who support Bernie Sanders.  He&apos;s the only one telling the truth about the corporatist Democrats who have sold out the American people with their disastrous trade agreements and support for income/wealth inequities.  They ought to realize that they are signing the death warrant for the Democratic Party but they are too arrogant and stupid to realize that supporting a criminal (war and domestic)  and a pathological liar for president is not going to succeed.  One way or the other Hillary Clinton will not be president!

How I do agree with you! I believe that perhaps Krugman has a cabinet level position in mind, and a wink and a nod with Secretary Clinton. Two weeks ago we discontinued our decades long subscription to the New York Times for the continuous and unapologetic pro-Clinton/anti-Bernie bias, and all of the other MSM outlets are guilty of the same spin. The Clintons have been around power for so long that they are deeply connected to the corporate media, among which we find some of her major donors: Time Warner for example, parent company to CNN.

Now I understand why CNN only advertises Clinton rather than to report on the election campaigns. NYT does the same - they in fact even publish articles written likely by Clinton that are purely advertisements for Clinton.

I, too, cancelled my decades-long subscription to the NYT for precisely the same reason - plus other instances of poor quality reporting. As someone I respect has observed once or twice (!), "Enough is enough!" . . . and so it is. And yes indeed, Mr. Krugman is angling and angling hard for a cabinet position, just one of the myriads shamelessly salivating for the nod and smile of the Empress.

Thank you Naomi Klein for your article, which was an excellent summation of most of my reasons for voting for Senator Sanders.  That the NYT and all other MSM outlets have ignored the immensely important issues your article addresses have resulted in MY shutting off my decades-long subscription to the Times.  It, and all MSM, have behaved disgracefully in this election, giving me the feeling a Soviet must have had reading "Pravda," but, now that the Soviet Union is no longer around to keep us and our corporations interested in providing the world with an attractive alternative (a functioning democracy), Americans can now enjoy this feeling at home as we become a hyper power banana republic of slaves.  
It was refreshing to see a journalist actually interested (unlike Krugman, Blow, and the rest of the Times&apos; nauseatingly unanimous journalists and opinionators) curious about an important reality.  As Lennon shouted, Gimme some truth!

And Monsanto et al, wasn&apos;t even mentioned.  And Hillary care.  And thank you Resnick -Day and all the young people who are willing to take action for the future

This article nails my feelings about the Clintons... up their neck in corporate America.  And let&apos;s make no mistake..... the business community could care less about the well being of most Ameicans except as a market.  In fact, I think you could make a great case that the .01% is intent on establishing an American aristocracy, similar to old Europe.  
      How closely Hillary is tied to Bill in terms of policy is an open question, but there is no question about where Bill stands.  I think Bill bought into "trickle down", hook line and sinker, and thought the wealthy were like overseers who were benevolent toward the American middle class and the working poor.  But you read books like "Who stole the American Dream" by Hedirck Smith and "Dark Money" by Jane Mayer and you begin to realize how wrong this view is.   Until Hillary is willing to give back wall street and corporate money, and release her speech to Goldman, I will remain suspicious.

... and until banksters go to jail instead of paying $81 billion in fines (according to RedState), it is the SOSO. I will vote for HRC if Bernie gets shut out (a likely event, since the MSM is complicit in burying him alive), but that is not going to stop the progressive movement from taking its cue from him as he passes the baton to Elizabeth Warren for 2020 hindsight. Of course, it may be too late by that time. The oligarchical Colossus has feet of clay, and the waters are lapping at them as we speak.

For the accurate record in 2008 Then senator Obama called Hillary "ANNIE OAKLEY" why" because she was campaigning in rural areas promoting guns in a very strong manner and in many ways, add this to the innumerable dishonesty of Hillary, a thorough disgrace

There is no doubt that every well-informed citizen who actually wants the best for all citizens will vote for Bernie. Unfortunately, he needs a majority.

The problem with my compatriot Ms Klein is she bashes away at Hillary&apos;s world view with her world view when she should be using her world class talent to encourage us all to discard our world views and eliminate the conflict that will surely soon destroy humanity. We haven&apos;t got time to fight. http://thelastwhy.ca/

Doug, what you are missing is the the 1% is fighting us all the time, to take our labor our homes, our property and our freedom.

Sorry Doug, but Adam and Eve never existed and if you expect respectful consideration of your point of view ... you&apos;ll have a very long wait.

Great article.  The point here - that Hillary Clinton inhabits a world where her behavior is 100% understandable, normal and even ethical - cannot be stressed enough.  The issue is not that she is "corrupt" or "dishonest".  It&apos;s that she comes from a worldview that isn&apos;t sustainable and that doesn&apos;t represent most of us.  The difference between her and Bernie isn&apos;t that he&apos;s "pure" and she&apos;s not.  It&apos;s that he isn&apos;t tied up in that money-influence-status-publicity-celebrity golden knot and she is.  Only someone from outside that paradigm could begin to consider moving us towards systemic change.  I just don&apos;t know how to go about explaining this to my Hillary-supporting friends, who have boiled the contest down to his loud and grating voice and his "sexism" vs. her femaleness and her "professionalism".  I guess I&apos;ll share your article!

Laura, if Clinton is honest why hasn&apos;t she released the Glodman Sachs transcripts? If they were innocent she would have produced them the next day! Transparency is a critical element necessary for democracy.

Be sure to direct them to the picture of Mr. Blankfein smiling at Ms. Clinton and ask them why the CEO of Goldman Sachs (or any of the other Wall St. CEOs who paid those sizable speaking fees to her) look so favorably upon Ms. Clinton.  And then ask them if they believe their own personal values align with those CEOs.  It a true test of cognitive dissonance, and the grade given is pass/fail.

Yes, and where are those speech transcripts? First, Hillary said "I&apos;ll look into it." Then she followed up with "only when everyone else, including Republicans, release their speech transcripts." She&apos;s hiding so much because the truth will hurt her.

Thank you, Ms Klein, for this excellent piece. Ever since they left the White House "almost broke", the Clinton family has constructed surely the most audacious influence peddling scheme in American history. Not content with selling influence to just the rich, The Clinton Family Foundation has sold influence to nations who are in fact opposed to the wellbeing of of not only their own citizens but our own as well. Mrs. Clinton loves to criticize Mr. Sanders&apos; record on firearms, for instance, but under her position as Secretary of State, the United States sold unprecedented numbers of weapons to aggressive nations and factions, causing grave human suffering throughout the world. Each one of these sales was preceded by a contribution to, yes, The Clinton Family Foundation. But this is just one of the facets of what is in fact a corporation whose tentacles entwine so much of what is corrupt not only on the national stage but around the world as well. One cannot help wondering what was on Mrs. Clinton&apos;s resume that reached out and grabbed Mr. Obama&apos;s attention and persuaded the President that she was just the person to guide America&apos;s foreign policy in an increasingly volatile world. Surely it was not her vote on the Iraq invasion. Was there anything else in her resume that would suggest that she was worthy of that office? I confess that I cannot find anything. Then perhaps it was not experience as a statesperson that gave her the position. Perhaps, just perhaps, the position became hers because of other reasons, reasons that could never be publicly uttered. Perhaps, just perhaps, the President of the United States was somehow beholden to the Clinton family for reasons that are as dark and unthinkable as the pattern of corruption that has permeated the careers of Mrs. Clinton and her husband for decades. If Mr. Clinton is  President of Clinton Enterprises, then certainly Mrs. Clinton is Chairman of the Board.

It all boils down to the question - are enough Americans paying attention?  I fear not, but still hope so.  Bernie could be our last best hope.

Please don&apos;t be so cynical.  Bernie is not our Last Hope, but our First Hope, and one of many to follow, since we now know that his campaign has grasped the crux of our nation&apos;s problems.  

Moreover, every empire has gone through what we are experiencing, and those former empires are all democratic socialist nations.

Cynical?  Consider both climate change, and the growing nuclear standoff between Pakistan and India, and there not no be as much time as you think to make the drastic changes in "the way we do business".

He&apos;s certainly our best hope at this critical moment.

Thank you Naomi Klein for sharing your logic, knowledge, wisdom, and passion. This article needs to be widely circulated via links in other comment areas, social media, etc. It is a powerful argument for why this election is so critical for our future.

It was so clear by the middle of the 1990&apos;s who Hillary really is it was glaring.   Those of us who thought she was not such a brazen corporate thug got our rude awakenings after a few years.  The statement at the 96 convention of "a leaner, meaner Democratic Party" made me cringe.   That and the 96 "welfare reform&apos;" that she was right on board with publicly spilled all of her cards.  She really is horrid, in a pathological way, about money.  Should have been thrown overboard upon her utterance of "leaner and meaner."  Bye bye, Goldwater Girl.  Here&apos;s hoping that even during austerity there&apos;s enough rope around to tow you back to the the Republican boat, where you belong.  You need to stop fucking with the Democratic Party, most of us were here way before you came over, thinking it might be fun for you.  Go home.

Thank you for mentioning the "Alberta Clipper" tar sands pipeline. The plan is to triple the capacity of an Enbridge pipeline currently running through the state of Wisconsin; it does not face the scrutiny of a new pipeline. Obama and Clinton were able to turn down the Keystone line yet the tar sands oil will still flow. Please note that this oil is taken from First Nation land in Canada and piped through the lands of many First Nations, as well as those of us who came later. Dirty, dangerous oil being moved through one of the largest fresh water reserves on the planet. These are the sacrifice zones of  the resource wars being waged by the petro oligarchs and the conditional elite who manage their affairs: yes, Hillary Clinton.  Our survival is at stake and no I will not be silent.

This has been the only article I have read, which actually lays out the way Clinton thinks. I am terrified she will get in and we will be at the mercy of the large corporations and big money. There is no doubt in my mind she will push the TPP as she has in the past, we will have more war and the inequality will increase.

Thanks Ms. Klein.  These connections are "lost" by the MSM & ignored by many of her supporters.  There are many more doors to influence & corruption these days & during this election.

Great article. Factual and well written!!!

This is perfect. I see people say all the time, "You can&apos;t prove Hillary changes positions because of donors!" but what they miss is the fact that the donors are getting a good return on investment. It might not be that she has to change positions to please donors, but that she fundamentally agrees with the people who fund her campaigns. She fundamentally believes that the US should be an imperial power and has the right to overthrow democratically elected governments. She believes that corporations are not the problem. It&apos;s not the greed. It&apos;s the irresponsible homeowners! You see this is the problem. We live in a society that is morally bankrupt and in which corruption is rampant. It&apos;s the system that has caused this and it is time to change the system fundamentally.

A sobering analysis, as always, Ms. Klein. Thank you for writing it.
