Sandra Bland posted this photograph of herself to Facebook in March 2015. (Sandra Bland / Facebook)

At first, she used Facebook in that cute, ho-hum way that most people do: selfies vamping new hairstyles, jocular shots with her sisters and momânothing special. Not until just after Christmas of 2014, and the debut of Selma. Within weeks of seeing that electrifying portrayal of the civil-rights era, she transformed her Facebook page. âIâm here to change history,â she declaimed in a smartphone video posted in January 2015.

She apologized that she was about to go to bed. In a T-shirt and with her hair pinned in rollers, she could not have seemed more unself-conscious. Her face glowed with the smile that everyone who knew her loved, and her voice was rich and friendly. âItâs time for me to do Godâs work,â she said. She called her new project #SandySpeaks.				
					
					
In the next few months, she would post over two dozen videos. Typically, they began with that smile and the greeting âGood morning, my beautiful kings and queens!â Her links took readers to articles about black history. (âNo, this is American history!â she corrected.) She posted about the economic crisis burdening young African Americans. She suggested that white people get black friends and that blacks befriend whites. That might be hard for African Americans to do, she said, but God was testing their ability âto show love to somebody who can hate you for no very reason.â				
					
					
In the days after she died, #SandySpeaks went viral. Her videos made her the first black casualty of police brutality whom the world could know and deeply love postmortem. Sheâs been gone now for almost a year, and we are still asking: #WhatÂ­HappenedtoSandraBland? Too often, that question has been merely a call to conspiracy theory: about monstrous jail guards murdering her, perfectly hiding the evidence, even taping her eyes open after death to take a convincing mug shot. The obsession over what transpired during three days at the end of her life has left little room for considering the 28 years before. Black lives matterâand hers was one of them, in its length, complication, and black pain.

Sandra Annette BlandâSandy, as everyone called herâwas born in 1987. Her mother, Geneva Reed, raised five girls on her own; she had the first at age 15. As an old friend from grade school remembers, Reedâs determination was âthunderous,â even as a child. She graduated from high school on time. She received a bachelorâs in journalism at age 23. Today, she has a real-estate business.				
					
					
Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.

She apologized that she was about to go to bed. In a T-shirt and with her hair pinned in rollers, she could not have seemed more unself-conscious. Her face glowed with the smile that everyone who knew her loved, and her voice was rich and friendly. âItâs time for me to do Godâs work,â she said. She called her new project #SandySpeaks.				
					
					
In the next few months, she would post over two dozen videos. Typically, they began with that smile and the greeting âGood morning, my beautiful kings and queens!â Her links took readers to articles about black history. (âNo, this is American history!â she corrected.) She posted about the economic crisis burdening young African Americans. She suggested that white people get black friends and that blacks befriend whites. That might be hard for African Americans to do, she said, but God was testing their ability âto show love to somebody who can hate you for no very reason.â				
					
					
In the days after she died, #SandySpeaks went viral. Her videos made her the first black casualty of police brutality whom the world could know and deeply love postmortem. Sheâs been gone now for almost a year, and we are still asking: #WhatÂ­HappenedtoSandraBland? Too often, that question has been merely a call to conspiracy theory: about monstrous jail guards murdering her, perfectly hiding the evidence, even taping her eyes open after death to take a convincing mug shot. The obsession over what transpired during three days at the end of her life has left little room for considering the 28 years before. Black lives matterâand hers was one of them, in its length, complication, and black pain.

Sandra Annette BlandâSandy, as everyone called herâwas born in 1987. Her mother, Geneva Reed, raised five girls on her own; she had the first at age 15. As an old friend from grade school remembers, Reedâs determination was âthunderous,â even as a child. She graduated from high school on time. She received a bachelorâs in journalism at age 23. Today, she has a real-estate business.				
					
					
Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

In the next few months, she would post over two dozen videos. Typically, they began with that smile and the greeting âGood morning, my beautiful kings and queens!â Her links took readers to articles about black history. (âNo, this is American history!â she corrected.) She posted about the economic crisis burdening young African Americans. She suggested that white people get black friends and that blacks befriend whites. That might be hard for African Americans to do, she said, but God was testing their ability âto show love to somebody who can hate you for no very reason.â				
					
					
In the days after she died, #SandySpeaks went viral. Her videos made her the first black casualty of police brutality whom the world could know and deeply love postmortem. Sheâs been gone now for almost a year, and we are still asking: #WhatÂ­HappenedtoSandraBland? Too often, that question has been merely a call to conspiracy theory: about monstrous jail guards murdering her, perfectly hiding the evidence, even taping her eyes open after death to take a convincing mug shot. The obsession over what transpired during three days at the end of her life has left little room for considering the 28 years before. Black lives matterâand hers was one of them, in its length, complication, and black pain.

Sandra Annette BlandâSandy, as everyone called herâwas born in 1987. Her mother, Geneva Reed, raised five girls on her own; she had the first at age 15. As an old friend from grade school remembers, Reedâs determination was âthunderous,â even as a child. She graduated from high school on time. She received a bachelorâs in journalism at age 23. Today, she has a real-estate business.				
					
					
Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

In the days after she died, #SandySpeaks went viral. Her videos made her the first black casualty of police brutality whom the world could know and deeply love postmortem. Sheâs been gone now for almost a year, and we are still asking: #WhatÂ­HappenedtoSandraBland? Too often, that question has been merely a call to conspiracy theory: about monstrous jail guards murdering her, perfectly hiding the evidence, even taping her eyes open after death to take a convincing mug shot. The obsession over what transpired during three days at the end of her life has left little room for considering the 28 years before. Black lives matterâand hers was one of them, in its length, complication, and black pain.

Sandra Annette BlandâSandy, as everyone called herâwas born in 1987. Her mother, Geneva Reed, raised five girls on her own; she had the first at age 15. As an old friend from grade school remembers, Reedâs determination was âthunderous,â even as a child. She graduated from high school on time. She received a bachelorâs in journalism at age 23. Today, she has a real-estate business.				
					
					
Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.

Sandra Annette BlandâSandy, as everyone called herâwas born in 1987. Her mother, Geneva Reed, raised five girls on her own; she had the first at age 15. As an old friend from grade school remembers, Reedâs determination was âthunderous,â even as a child. She graduated from high school on time. She received a bachelorâs in journalism at age 23. Today, she has a real-estate business.				
					
					
Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Sandra Annette BlandâSandy, as everyone called herâwas born in 1987. Her mother, Geneva Reed, raised five girls on her own; she had the first at age 15. As an old friend from grade school remembers, Reedâs determination was âthunderous,â even as a child. She graduated from high school on time. She received a bachelorâs in journalism at age 23. Today, she has a real-estate business.				
					
					
Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Reed grew up on Chicagoâs Near West Side. But by the time she had Sandy, the area was profoundly segregated, poverty-stricken, and violent. So in the 1990s, when Sandy was 9, Reed headed with her daughters to the suburbsâsettling in DuPage County, just west of Chicago. DuPage is affluent, quiet, and back then was just 4 percent black.				
					
					
Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.

The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Deeply religious, Reed joined the DuPage African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was feted by the Chicago Tribune as a flagship of the suburbsâ emerging black middle class. By age 13, Sandy was singing in the choir, standing next to her classmate Robert Lega. The two became close, mainly, Lega told me, because Sandy had a wicked sense of humor and never took offense at his gross adolescent jokes. Dee and Lionel Watts were church members who were childless, and they, too, loved Sandy. Dee, a software engineer, became Sandyâs godmother.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.

The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.

Sandy was âspunky, feisty, and wasnât going to let anyone run over her,â says Joyce Kordas, who taught business courses at the largely white high school. The white teachers werenât used to it. Sandy joined a dizzying array of extracurricular groups, from the foreign-language honor society to the cheerleading squad, where she was the only black member. And she joined the concert band, playing tromboneâa choice that shaped her life.				
					
					
In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

In her senior year, she was accepted on a music scholarship to Prairie View A&M University, near Houston. The school was founded for ex-slaves after the Civil War, and it sits in Waller County, in Texasâs historically Deep South region. The little town surrounding the school, also named Prairie View, today has a few thousand residents; this small population is overwhelmingly black.				
			

							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						
 
The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		


							“Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens! —Sandra Bland, in her #SandySpeaks Facebook project
						


The school bandâs name is the Marching Storm, and itâs known for pioneering the drum line. At black colleges, the marching bandâs halftime shows are fantastic affairs, often a bigger draw than the game itself. At Prairie View, the larger-than-life band leader was George âProfâ Edwards, a stern but affectionate taskmaster. When he was displeased with someoneâs performance, he often ordered the errant student to do push-ups. He demanded martial discipline via a traditional enactment of masculinity that included the female members. According to Lanitra Dean, a schoolmate of Sandyâs who played clarinet, Edwards used to say: âThere are no females in the bandâno girls.â Sandy was âno girlsâ times two. Dean remembers that she eagerly conformed to the bandmasterâs grueling schedule. Sandy, Dean says, was âstrongââeven as she confided in some friends at Prairie View that she had epilepsy. âShe never cried.â				
					
					
And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

							});
						
During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

And she was busy without letup. She joined a historically black sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, which emphasizes community service. She constantly volunteered for projects. She also helped LaVaughn Mosley, a middle-aged man at Prairie View who worked with students from poor families who had problems adjusting to college. Mosley was dazzled by Sandyâs talent for counseling. He became her friend and mentor.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

							});
						
During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Sandy majored in what Prairie View A&M calls âanimal science.â Sorority sister Ashley Gooden remembers Sandy often saying that she wanted to work for the Food and Drug Administration. But when she graduated, in 2009, there were few jobs open in animal science.				
					
					
Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

							});
						
During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Unemployment that year was dire for everyone. The recession badly hurt young college graduates, but black grads had it worse, especially black women, who were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white women. Overall, in 2010, one in five African Americans whoâd just finished college couldnât get a job. Many who were lucky enough to be hired ended up in low-paid positions unrelated to their majors.

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

During her first months after graduation, Sandy got a job at Prairie Viewâs Cooperative Extension Program as an office assistant. She commuted from Houston, where she was living with her boyfriend, a fellow Prairie View graduate and music-education major, who was also struggling to find work that matched his degree.				
					
					
As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

As she drove around Houston and Prairie View, Sandy was deluged with traffic tickets, fines, and court costs. Texas has no income tax, and the state, its counties, and its municipalities have to get the money from somewhere. One way is through traffic tickets, using a system similar to the one the Justice Department has criticized in Ferguson, Missouri. In Texas, extra charges are attached to the tickets, and they are staggering. Thereâs a $25 ârecords managementâ fee, a $15 âjudicial fundâ fee, and $15 added to each bail-bond payment. The tickets themselves also include add-ons to fund a statewide program providing services for people with brain and spinal-cord injuries. Even Prairie View A&Mâs juvenile-justice school was funded with money from traffic tickets.				
					
					
In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

In 2009, Sandy received tickets for driving in Waller County without a seat belt, driving without liability insurance, and speeding. Her fines and costs totaled $876.50. The following year, she was cited in Houston for speeding and colliding with a vehicle. The court told her she owed $260, though she said she was unemployed. She didnât pay, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.				
					
					
And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

And then there was marijuana. In the Houston suburbs, Sandy was charged in 2009 with misdemeanor possession of a small amount. Her arrest was predictable: Nationally, one in five people her age were smoking marijuana in 2009, but people of color were especially likely to be criminally charged. In Harris County, which includes Houston, proportionately three times as many blacks as whites were being arrested and subjected to some of the harshest punishments in the country. Sandy faced prison time and a $4,000 fine. Her first year out of school was not going well.				
					
					
Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Carl Anthony Moore is a Houston lawyer and Prairie View A&M alumnus. Sandy hired him to defend her, and he got the marijuana charge dropped and replaced with possession of âparaphernalia.â The fine was $500 and no jail time.				
					
					
But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand.

But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

But then, in May 2010, Sandy was again arrested in Houston, as she was driving home from a party after midnight. A sheriffâs deputy said he noticed a car going too fast, with a bad headlight and the taillights out. He thought Sandy was drunk. She told him she didnât drink much because of her epilepsy, so the few drinks sheâd had that night might have affected her more than they would other people. She took a Breathalyzer test; it came back barely above the legal limit. She was arrested anyway, for DUI. Later, when her car was impounded, the deputy found a small plastic bag with 1.4 grams of marijuana. That amount would barely have made three joints. In Texas, it was enough for another possession charge.

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â

Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family.

Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Moore again represented Sandy. This time, he got the DUI dropped. He thought he could successfully fight the marijuana charge, too, but Sandy told him not to try. She seemed demoralized and overwhelmed, Moore says, as though she was having trouble coping with the stress of the caseâand with stress in general. She had earlier told him that she smoked marijuana daily, and he wondered if she was self-medicating. Moore didnât get a chance to explore further: She didnât have the money to pay for more of his services, so she pleaded guilty to the possession charge. Her sentence was 30 days in lockup.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

									});
								
Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500.

Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.

In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

The Houston areaâs main correctional facility is the Harris County Jail, which houses around 9,000 inmates each day. It was, and is, notorious. A year before Sandy landed there, the Justice Department investigated the jail and found rampant civil-rights violations. Overcrowding was one. Fights were another. Dirty sheets, clothing, and mattresses were common. In the intake area, there were no toilets, only holes in the floor.				
					
					
After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

After doing her 30 days in these conditions, Sandy broke up with her boyfriend and returned to Illinois, to resume her job search and reunite with her family. But she was worried that the Texas warrantâfor the speeding and collision fine sheâd never paidâwould haunt her when she tried to renew her license in Illinois.				
					
					
So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.

Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

So Sandy did what is known among Texasâs poor as âsitting outâ traffic tickets. The state lets people discharge their tickets with credit earned by serving time in jail. Sandy went back to the dirty, crowded, violent Harris County Jail and spent several days âpayingâ her ticket, earning $100 a day in credits.				
					
					
After she was released, her Prairie View friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley asked her how sheâd managed. Sandy was all strength and bravado, giving him the impression that âit was nothing to her to sit out timeâ and that sheâd done it âlike a champ!â				
					
					
Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Back in Illinois, she went from shitty job to shitty job. She worked some shifts at Portilloâs, a hot-dog and milkshake cafÃ©. She did a few days at McDonaldâs. She signed up with a temp agency. Sometimes she lived with her godmother, Dee Watts, and Deeâs husband Lionel. Other times, she stayed with her sisters, watching their children. She felt boxed in, and went back and forth to Texas on buses. By 2013, she was in Illinois again, still without her own place to live and still working as a temp. She hoped these brief assignments would lead to a permanent hire. They never did. According to her tax returns, in 2013, four years out of school, she grossed less than $8,000.

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.

Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Her misdemeanors seem to have plagued her job search. In a later Facebook posting, she discussed a workshop about how to get oneâs criminal record expunged. She introduced the post with a quote, suggesting that sheâd heard it during her own job interviews: âWe think you are a great candidate, but based on your backgroundâ¦â				
					
					
Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.

She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Her âbackgroundâ got worse in Illinois. According to state data, black drivers in towns like Naperville, Lisle, and Villa Park are up to four and a half times more likely to be stopped for traffic violations than white drivers, and up to four times more likely to be searched. Fines collected from tickets are mostly put into county and township general funds. As in Texas, they operate like taxes on the poor.				
			

							By 2013, Sandy was in Illinois again, still without her own place and still working as a temp. She grossed less than $8,000 that year.
						
 
In July 2013, Sandy got stopped in Naperville for speeding. She was also ticketed for driving without insurance and with a suspended registration and driverâs license. Her fine came to over $4,000. She didnât appear at her court hearing. An arrest warrant was issued, and she spent a night in jail.				
					
					
Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas.

She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Sandy was bonded out by Lionel Watts, her godmotherâs husband, who recalls his wifeâs puzzlement that Sandyâs mom hadnât paid the bond. Geneva Reed-Vealâher mom had gotten marriedâhas acknowledged in recent press interviews that she and her daughter had long-standing conflicts. She and Sandyâs sisters declined to speak with me on the record; what those conflicts were about, Reed-Veal has not said publicly. But according to Lionel, he and Dee became Sandyâs economic fallback in this period, especially Dee. She transferred the title of her old Cadillac to Sandy. She opened a joint bank account with her. And she was Sandyâs sounding board.				
					
					
By 2014, Sandy owed thousands of dollars in tickets. Late one night in Naperville, she was arrested while driving with an inarguably high blood-alcohol level. As a one-time incident for a young adult, speeding and drunk driving might be deemed a sowing-oneâs-oats peccadilloâbut with Sandy, they suggested emotional troubles.				
					
					
Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Robert Lega, her childhood friend from church choir, was living in Chicago, and the two occasionally called each other to catch up. Sandy often told him about her problems finding work and being broke. And she told him she suffered from depression.				
					
					
Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Hearing a friend talk about depression was unusual for Lega. Considering it as a medical condition deserving of treatment is not something black people generally do, he says. Instead, âItâs like, âHey, man, if youâve got problems, figure out a way to deal with them.ââ Legaâs observation is echoed by research and anecdotal evidence. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4 percent of African Americans report major depression, a significantly higher percentage than whites, at just over 3 percent. Still, while about 14 percent of the population in general sought treatment for depression in 2011, only about 8 percent of African Americans did. Black women have it even worse than black men: They are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head.

Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.

On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still donât have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists donât accept them.				
					
					
Another is what several feminist researchers call âthe myth of the Strong Black Woman.â Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women.				
					
					
After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

After liberation, an emerging African-American womenâs-club movement tried to reconfigure the slavery-era idea that, as Zora Neale Hurston wrote in the 1930s, the black woman was the worldâs âmule.â Instead, the movement took up the notion of âstrong black womanhoodâ in service to the race. It tried to turn a contemptible stereotype likening black women to pack animals into one that celebrated their profound human dignity. But the new myth turned out to be a Faustian bargain: At least partly because of it, black women find it hard to talk about their suffering in a culture where racism and sexism continue to sap health and spirits.				
					
					
Monica Coleman is a professor of African-American religion at Claremont College and a theologian ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal church, the same denomination as Sandyâs. Coleman has struggled since adolescence with major depression and suicidal thoughts. She wants the black church to be a place where people like Sandy can go to give and get help with depression. But very few churches provide mental-health counseling, Coleman notes. Instead, they recommend casting out depression through prayer. âFaith can help,â she says, âbut it doesnât get rid of chemical imbalances or life stressors.â				
					
					
In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

									});
								
Immediately after Sandyâs death in July 2015, jail intake documents surfaced indicating that she had told the guards that sheâd âlost a babyâ a year earlier. Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly.

Ectopic pregnancies are complicated medical experiences that most people donât fully understand. That may be why, when asked by reporters, one of Sandyâs sisters said only that Sandy had âa miscarriageââand that she had taken it in stride. But Sandy also reported that after she âlost a baby,â she tried to commit suicide by taking pills. Her family said they knew nothing about this.				
					
					
Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

In 2014, according to Lionel Watts, Sandy got pregnant. Medical records indicate that it was an ectopic pregnancy. The condition occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in a fallopian tube rather than in the uterus. The result, usually experienced early in pregnancy, can be excruciating pain as well as the risk of a burst tube, internal bleeding, and death. Timely treatment usually saves the womanâs life. But in the aftermath, there is a risk of additional ectopic pregnancies as well as permanent infertility. In all, ectopic pregnancy is harrowing.

He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Sandyâs godmother Dee Watts may have known. Her husband vaguely remembers Sandy seeming âsullenâ and saying something to Dee about it. But Dee at the time had her own grave medical problems: She was terminally ill with cancer, and in July 2014âjust weeks after Sandyâs pregnancyâshe died. Dee was the older woman that Sandy had leaned on, for money, a place to stay, and a sympathetic ear. Lionel went into mourning and says he didnât feel like having Sandy in the house anymore. He spoke with her much less often than when Dee was alive.

On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

One of the last times Lionel saw Sandy was when she asked him for a ride to a job interview. He drove her to Cookâs, a manufacturer and distributor of cookware and kitchen supplies, mostly for prisons. Sandy was hired as an administrative assistant. The job paid only $13.50 an hour, but it was the first steady job sheâd had in years. Lionel was happy for her. Not long after, she told him she was living with an older man who worked at Cookâs. An older man with steady employment, Lionel thought, would be good for Sandy.				
					
					
Cookâs is a family-run business with about 30 employees, most of them white. One job perk is the chance to appear in short YouTube videos that advertise Cookâs products. Sandy starred in some. In one video, she bends a red spoon back and forth while touting its softness and the fact that âit cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon.â				
					
					
A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.

They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

A few months after she was hired by Cookâs, she saw Selma and started #SandySpeaks. She never posted on Facebook about her job, even though working there began to weigh on her as she became more politicized by the Black Lives Matter movement. âShe had grown tired of helping âthe Manâ generate profit off the backs and sweat of black people,â Lega remembers her saying one evening as they ate dinner together. âI just canât do this anymore,â she told him about working at Cookâs. âIt hurts my heart.â But she desperately needed the income, not to mention the health insurance.

									});
								
Sandy did not typically speak on Facebook about her misdemeanor record, her problems with money, or anything else personal and dark. But in early March, after two weeks of uncharacteristic silence, she finally offered a personal revelation: She was suffering from depression and PTSD. On that very day, she said, she had been crying. Her illness was âsomething that the African American culture likes to turn a blind eye to.â Coping for her was a daily struggle, against ânothing but the Devil.â				
					
					
In response to this confession, Sandy got no practical advice from her hundreds of Facebook followers, and barely any sympathy. There was a sad-face emoji, and one comment. âDepression sucks,â it said.				
					
					
Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

									});
								
In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

Meanwhile, she found an outlet for her increasing political awareness. She was determined to help the Jackie Robinson West baseball team, a group of black boys who had won the 2014 Little League World Series, but had the title taken away after it was discovered that some of the boys didnât live in the teamâs catchment area. Sandy vowed to collect petitions calling for reinstatement of the trophy. She spent hours at suburban malls, asking shoppers for signatures. She was disappointed that, though black people sometimes stopped, almost all of the very few people who signed were white.				
					
					
She continued to post links to articles about disturbing injustices against black people. As April went by, they focused increasingly on police shootings of unarmed young men. One day she put up her own slogan, in capital letters: AT FIRST THEY USED A NOOSE. NOW ALL THEY DO IS SHOOT. She posted an image of a young black man in close-up, his neck encircled by an American flag, knotted so as to kill him by hanging. She made the noose image her profile picture.				
					
					
A few days later, she left Cookâsâand became jobless and uninsured.				
			

							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						
 
In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black). Her family filed a lawsuit, charging that the jail and jailers didnât do what they should have done to prevent her from committing suicide. The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		


							Black women are among the most undertreated groups for depression in the nation.
						


In June, she posted something else to Facebook about herself: âWalked into the house to a sink full of dishes. So I smashed a few plates (literally) to make myself feel better.â âLOL,â one response said.				
					
					
On June 17, an armed white supremacist named Dylann Roof massacred nine black people during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in South Carolina. Sandy immediately posted about the murders. At around this time, judging by a postmortem photograph of her inner left forearm, she seems to have cut herself repeatedly. The wounds were small, numerous, and neatly spaced. A bit of makeup, or a subtle turn of her forearm inward, would have easily made the cuts hard to see. Apparently, no one saw.

In late June, she called her old friend in Prairie View, LaVaughn Mosley. They had a long talk about her frustration and, as Mosley calls it, her desperation. Her feelings for the older man with whom she was living had diminished, even as he was getting more serious. The relationship had become one of convenience, a roof over her head. She had asked her mother if she could move in with her. She told Mosley that her mother had said she would think about it. Mosley urged Sandy to go onto the Prairie View A&M jobs website. She did, and found three positions. One was permanent, for someone with a college degree. Two were clerical and temporary, for just a few weeks that summer. She applied for all of them.				
					
					
As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.

The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.				
					
					
On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black).

The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

As she awaited replies, she drove with her mother to Tennessee over the July 4 weekend to visit family. According to her momâs account in a Chicago magazine profile, they spent the road trip discussing old tensions, to the constant sound of the gospel-music CDs that Sandy had brought, and attempting to rebuild their relationship.				
					
					
On Wednesday, July 8, Mosley got another call from Sandy. Prairie View wanted to interview her the next day. Her mother still hadnât let her know if she could move in, and as Mosley recalls, she was at the end of her rope with DuPage County. âFuck itâIâm going to Texas!â he remembers her saying. The following morning, he came home from a bicycle ride and found Sandy in his driveway. She had driven over 1,000 miles, nonstop, in 16 hours. According to Mosley, she had not told her boyfriend or kin that she was leaving.				
					
					
She took a shower and went, on no sleep, to the interview. She was hired for one of the temporary jobs. It paid $13.80 an hour and would be just four weeks long. Her hire letter warned that it was âcontingent upon the clearance of a background check.â Ecstatic nonetheless, Sandy called people to announce that she was hired. One of them was Mosley. He congratulated her and said she could stay with him until she got on her feet. He never saw her again.				
					
					
The following afternoon, on Thursday, July 10, Sandy signed the papers for her job at Prairie View. She had just left that appointment when she was pulled over, brutalized, and arrested by Texas state trooper Brian Encinia.				
					
					
* * *				
					
					
At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

Postmortem, people of all races mourned Sandy as they might a dead daughter or good friend. Memorials, hashtags, and protests erupted, along with complicated theories about her being murdered by her jailers (many of whom were Latino or black).

The defendants have responded to this eminently reasonable charge with stunning and stupefying cruelty, arguing that âBlandâs decision to commit suicide was hers alone.â Her family still doubts publicly that she killed herself, even as their own lawsuit suggests otherwise.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.

At the county jail, Sandy told a Latino guard during intake that she had felt âvery depressedâ during the past year and that she felt that way at that moment. She added that she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after losing her pregnancy (âa baby,â the jailer wrote). She said sheâd experienced the death of a loved one.

									});
								
Her revelationsâand they were very brave ones, made to a stranger and signaling a desire for helpâbrought her no assistance whatsoever. Itâs true that a little less than three hours after her intake, on a separate form, she contradicted herself and said she wasnât depressed, never had been, and hadnât thought of killing herself recently. Nonetheless, according to jail protocol, she should have been immediately seen by a mental-health professional and perhaps hospitalizedâor, at the very least, put on suicide watch. None of these interventions happened. And, apparently, no one looked at her forearm.				
					
					
She was charged with felony assault on a public servant and placed in a security cell that by chance was empty except for her. In effect, a very sociable young woman with signs of serious mental-health problems, and with a deep need to derive comfort from just being able to talk to someone, was thrown into solitary confinement.				
					
					
Her cell phone was confiscated. Inmates are able to use a phone on the wall inside their cells, but only if each person they dial agrees to a $14.99 charge. They are instructed to pour water down the cellâs floor drain every time they use the toilet. And they are ordered never to use the jail intercom except in an emergency.

Since Sandyâs death, discussion has grown about Black Lives Matter activists suffering from depression. They talk of being worn down and worn out by the constant microaggressions they suffer, and which they spend their lives fighting. One woman has talked of wanting to fire a gun to her head. MarShawn McCarrel, a 23-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, went beyond wanting: He fatally shot himself on the steps of his stateâs capitol, after posting on his Facebook page, âMy demons won today. Iâm sorry.â				
					
					
Amid the demons, everyone remembers the goodness of Sandy, especially a little boy who said goodbye to her. Eleven-year-old Taejon Washington lived in her apartment complex in DuPage County. He recalls a summer day when he and some friends discovered a game called the âCharlie Charlie Challenge,â which had gone viral on YouTube. To play, you take a piece of paper and write Yes/No/No/Yes in a four-square grid, then balance one pencil precariously on top of another, crosswise, in the center of the grid. âCharlie, Charlie, are you here?â the players in these videos intoneâand when the upper pencil swings to âYes,â they run away shrieking in gleeful terror.				
					
					
Sandy approached Taejon and his friends. She had talked to them before, and they liked her. Sheâd been recording them with her phone; she said she wanted to document their lives. She told them they shouldnât play the gameâit was about summoning demons, not Jesus. Taejon felt grateful. After they spoke, she said she was leaving for Texas. They waved, and she drove off.				
					
					
Days later, Taejon saw the horrifying arrest video and heard how Sandy was found dead. He doesnât believe that she committed suicide. All he knows about her is that Sandy was the nice lady who gave him counsel and documented him with her cell phone. And as to the question #WhatHappenedtoSandraBland?, he knows that she was killed.				
					
					
		

On Saturday, Sandyâs bond was set at $515, and she was allowed free calls from the booking desk. She contacted a sister who was hardly in a position to send $515, since she was being sued by her landlord for back rent, to the tune of more than $1,500. Mosley didnât have the bond money either; he told Sandy that he would raise it from his fraternity brothers. He started contacting them but felt little urgencyâafter all, Sandy had always told him that âsitting outâ time in jail had been so easy for her. By Sunday, neither he nor her family had the bond money ready.				
					
					
Sandy called no one from her cell. No one visited. She was a woman with a reputation for never cryingâyet, according to the women in a nearby cell, she spent Sunday sobbing uncontrollably and saying, repeatedly, that being locked up was not a life she could deal with.				
					
					
On Monday, at about 6:30 am, she refused breakfast. Just before 8 am, she used the emergency-only intercom to beg a jail employee for more free calls from the front desk. He refused and said she needed to use the telephone in her cell. Two minutes later, she was on the intercom, making the same request. He again refused.				
					
					
An hour later, she was found hanging from a bathroom privacy partition in her cell with a noose around her neck, fashioned from a plastic, jail-issue garbage bag. Her feet were touching the ground. The position is well known among coroners as being common in suicides, and quite effective for quickly causing death.

I am now reading "Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin," except for the Bible, it was the best-selling book of the 19th century, a book to which many attribute the inspiration for Northerners to fight in the Civil War.  Lincoln&apos;s  Republican Party was a newly formed protest party after the 1854 Dread Scott Supreme Court decision, the decision confirming that African-Americans were "property."  After the Civil War and about 20 years of "Reconstruction" era, the Republican Party abandoned the "free the slaves" cause and became the party of American Aristocracy and Big Business, for political expediency.  The Democratic Party is following the same pattern: After championing institutional civil and human rights for African-Americans in the 1960&apos;s, the Democratic party quietly abandoned that cause, moving towards a 21st century version of Corporate Aristocracy, and by the 1990&apos;s: (1)Black Family Fathers were devastated  by the Democratic Party&apos;s passive  support for extreme criminal punishment and increased incarceration, insidiously targeting African-Americans; (2) Black Family Mothers were devastated by the Democratic Party&apos;s passive support for "Welfare Reform" also dog-whistled at African-Americans.  They still support the Democratic Party,  because Republicans are worse. The Republicans mostly instigated the incarceration injustice and "welfare reform."  The Democratic Party Establishment mitigated these efforts, but ultimately, passively supported them, for political expediency. The Democrats are, âThe Lesser of Two Evils.â  The only real future hope for African-Americans nowadays, is the rise of young, energetic, intelligent African-Americans, like Sandra Bland. However, the white-identity political racists, and white-identity law enforcement racists, both perceive people like Sandra Bland as a threat to their culture, but they still like âUncle Tomsâ the good-natured survivors, who are not a threat.

I have been wondering what her life was like. I begin to get a picture. I agree that she made some bad decisions, and it seems she needed help with depression, but I believe I can understand feeling like my decisions hardly matter anymore; I wasn&apos;t going to get a break that would last. I&apos;m a white woman whoâs had lots of luck, but a long time out of work made me feel like I had no value to society. If society had almost always seemed indifferent to my well-being, that, combined with my knowledge of the widespread cruelty of human beings world-wide would have made me suicidal at an early age. We have got to recognize each otherâs innate dignity or risk losing our humanity entirely. Tears.

Portraits like this one are meant to give all of us - - black, white, mixed and other - - a slow, heavy pause. We know, or we think we know, how the system grinds down the most determined of souls. Among whites, it&apos;s  important to take in the profound unfairness, the impossibility - - under many circumstances -- of turning things around and surviving the torrential assaults on one&apos;s income, sense of self, relations with others, and hope for a different future.

Thank you for this heartbreaking essay. To be disposable to the culture, to be persecuted by it, as well as all the everyday challenges we have to deal with, would make nearly anyone despair. We need so much healing and I would hope that reading and hearing these stories will help people comprehend that social justice is long denied. It kills our spirits and grieves us daily. Lack of access to mental health help and the continuing stigma that only "crazy" people see therapists, as well as the institutional racism, make getting the kind of treatment one needs very difficult. Universal health care and prevention campaigns. Money spent in service of the people instead of the endless war machine.

Sandra Bland committed suicide. It does not follow that because the arrest may have been unjustified that the police or the prison officials are responsible for her death.  

But we still have people out there that claim the prison officials hanged her.  Now that is just plain nonsense.  Why aren&apos;t such people called out for their reckless accusations?

I may be wrong, but murder is still a possibility when one sees the violence inflicted upon her and specious fraudulent charges brought against her ("She was charged with felony assault on a public servant .")  They indicate a high degree of unwarranted contempt for a relatively harmless person.  Murders are never intended to look like murders.  This one doesn&apos;t.

Ah...that great sucking silence! Poor, poor misguided young woman. There is enough guilt to go around in this tragic story to fill many life times! Need is a very real reality in people&apos;s lives, especially after a world economic meltdown. It ain&apos;t never been easy to be black in America but this young woman experienced far too much of what is the ugly underbelly of this society and she was clearly abandoned and let to fend for herself without the proper tools and emotional input.
Her mother will never sleep easy again, nor will the numerous people of color (as if their race would make a difference) employed by the jail that ignored her obvious need and plea for help

There&apos;s a lot missing in Waller County&apos;s report.  Can it be found?

This is horrifying. A certain kind of isolation despite sociability, the constant need to project strength, to depend on herself so fiercely, the difficulty of finding a place for herself as a young college graduate hoping to use overwhelming desire and real talent for the common good, combined with lack of treatment for depression, is very disturbing. Her own mistakes are heart-breaking. So sorry. Sandra Bland, R.I.P.

If the police in that jail were innocent of murdering Sandra Bland, they would have presented a fingerprint analysis of the plastic bag that was used to hang Sandra, because it would have shown her finger prints on the inside of the knots in that bag that was used to hang her.   The fact that they have NOT done that (or destroyed the evidence showing who actually tied those knots)  strongly indicates that Sandra Bland was deliberately murdered.

Are we finally dropping the bizarre claim that that Bland&apos;s death was not a suicide?   It is about time.  The woman was depressed.  Her jailers did not pick up on it, but that&apos;s negligence, not racism. Her family&apos;s failure to raise bail is also troubling.  

If you are a Black woman with a terrible driving record driving through Texas with out of state plates and you are stopped by a white State Trooper who politely asks you to put out your cigarette so he does not have to breath in your second hand smoke--what do you do?

Bland made the wrong choice.  She could have averted this tragedy with a bit more common sense.

Stop repeating yourself, Bitch.

So, let me get this straight - you think because this young woman did not use common sense that she should have lost her life? I think you have clearly exhibited a clear rift in your lifelong accumulation of common sense if you think her death was justified!
Take the time to think about the young, wealthy white kid that killed four people with his car that was released to serve &apos;probation&apos; because he suffered from &apos;affluenza&apos;! Are you kidding me?

The facts are these - young black women and men are not allowed to make mistakes. If they do, they are punished much more harshly and with much more frequency. The so-called micro agressions endured by black people all over this country are not small agressions. They loom very large. If you get underwater early and are harassed enough you begin, as a human being, to break down. The pain of the protester at that first Bernie Sander&apos;s event was palpable. Our young black people are literally crying for help. They don&apos;t need ever more shame or the mantle of respectability politics to be brought down on them. They need us to collectively hug them and see them as human beings. Your lecture doesn&apos;t pass muster. In the aggregate, it&apos;s clear that Sandy had some problems, but even more than this fact,  she had SO MUCH PROMISE! I mourn for her and the other future (and past) victims of our racist institutions and injustice system.

I am not sure if we are (objectively) reading Mr. Muraskin&apos;s comments the same way.  I am not reading anything about the tragic end being "due" or "deserved".  I read someone defending the integrity of the police and jail with regards to a charge of murder.  I disagree with his premise that the arrest and jail bear no responsibility, but if he knows the staff, then he might be able to defend them.  That is not to say that Ms. Bland did not have some responsibility or much with regard to the traffic violation and her reaction to the officer, but we can empathize with her, especially if she was suffering from depression.  Second of all, I would offer Ms. Bland the same advice.  I offer it to my son and his friends.  Be courteous and respectful in encounters with the police.  Assert your rights to a point.  At the scene is no place to further press for justice unless you can get a supervisor or television crew on scene.  Police are people potentially with people problems; they may err or they may be bad at their jobs.  I can fathom Ms Bland&apos;s frustration, but the point about out-of-state plates is something I consider even with a nearly perfect driving record.  The article, which was a worthy read, creates a situation in which suicide was plausible.  This breaks my heart because I am an advocate for increased mental health care and research.  Ms. Bland needed breaks and apparently got none.  I know that San Antonio is approaching encounters with people with potential mental illness or disorders in a more enlightened way.  We need to advocate for increased awareness of mental health issues and for an end to policing for profit (not to mention for profit jails).  Finally, this is a vast nation and people have different understanding and perceptions.  Some people may be offended by the charge of racism.  We need a dialogue on the issues that is calm and informative and that means tolerance and patience.

Just how much more patience do you expect out of poor black people?  Or any black people, for that matter?
While you sit there and talk on and on about the police and being as cooperative as one can, what about the person who&apos;s simply had enough that day and doesn&apos;t handle themselves well?  Every time I watched that video, and that was not many, the most chilling thing to me is that I myself might have acted just the way Sandra did.  
While I would have put out the cigarette, that did NOT give that cop reason to physically take her down and arrest her in that manner.  And he sure did not have the right to tell her he would "light her up" with a tazer for not moving fast enough - how professional is that?  Does his behavior warrant courtesy and respect?  But because she was a black woman with problems, it really was all her fault, right?  Hardly. 
I am a 54 year old white woman who in my outrage at being pulled over for such a ridiculous stop might have argued back.  And I too have had many speeding tickets, so I know when I deserve to be pulled over and when I don&apos;t.  But it is highly unlikely that I, or anyone who looked like me, would end up in a jail cell, much less threatened with a tazer.  If you can&apos;t see that, then any further discussion of systemic racism is kind of worthless in this day and age.

Ms. Brazzle, you state it ever so much clearer than I and I thank you!
