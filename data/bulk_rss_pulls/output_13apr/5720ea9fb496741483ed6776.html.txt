Ted Cruz says he'll make a "major announcement" Wednesday afternoon in Indiana, news that has sparked speculation he may name a running mate, despite trailing Donald Trump in the delegate count.

The Cruz event is scheduled for 4 p.m. ET in Indianapolis.

Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe earlier this week confirmed the campaign had arrived at a short list of possible vice presidential candidates.

We have narrowed our VP candidates to a short list and are going thru the normal processes associated with picking a running mate.#CruzCrew

Speculation has focused on Carly Fiorina, a former GOP presidential candidate who endorsed Cruz and has campaigned for him. NBC News reported that the former Hewlett-Packard CEO was spotted in Indianapolis ahead of the Cruz event.

CONFIRMED: Carly Fiorina's in Indianapolis - spotted by @NBCNews cameras. More to come. #veepstakes?

Trump weighed in on the possibility Wednesday morning on Fox News Channel'sÂ Fox & Friends.Â âWell, I think it hurts him. I canât imagine he does it. First of all, he shouldn't be naming anybody because he doesn't even have a chance."

In another interview withÂ Good Morning America, Trump indicated he wasn't concerned. "Carly did not resonate."

The announcement of a running mate prior to securing the nomination would be an unusual development in a remarkable campaign, to say the least.

However, it would not be completely without precedent.Â In 1976, Ronald Reagan named anÂ  early running mate â Pennsylvania Sen. Richard S. Schweiker â as part of his bid to defeat President Gerald Ford. That gambit did not work, as Ford prevailed over Reagan at the 1976 Republican convention.

Whatever the announcement is, it comes the day after the Texas senator lost a series of states to Donald Trump in the northeast.
