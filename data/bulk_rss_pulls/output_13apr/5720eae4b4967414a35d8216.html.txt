As president, would Trump really paint the columns on the White House gold?  And change out all the White House fixtures to gold?  People are tired of hearing about how Trump is like Hitler: more like Saddam Hussein, at least when it comes to decor? Perhaps  Trump would like a golden statue of himself....But how to make cotton candy hair in metal.  There must be a way for him  to have spun gold on his head?
