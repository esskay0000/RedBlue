After being blamed for running Gov.Â Scott Walker'sÂ short-lived presidential campaign into the ground last year, GOP political operativeÂ Rick WileyÂ has now found a politician with deeper pockets.

Wiley â a former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party âÂ will serve as national political directorÂ for GOP presidential front-runnerÂ Donald Trump.Â The appointment comes two days after WalkerÂ laughed off suggestions of being Trump's running mate.

âRick is a seasoned political expert with a very successful career in winning elections," Trump said in a news release. "He brings decades of experience, and his deep ties to political leaders and activists across the country will be a tremendous asset as we enter the final phase of securing the nomination.â

Wiley did not return a call or text message on Wednesday.

But he said in the Trump release that voters are hungry for someone to shake up Washington: "Donald Trump has energized millions of hard working people across the country with his no-nonsense straight talk and will bring his record of success to tackle the real problems that face our nation.â

Last year, WileyÂ came under withering criticismÂ from conservative bloggers, talk show hosts and publications after Walker shut down his campaign operation in September after just 71 days.

Most focused on how the campaign â under Wiley's leadership â burned through millions of dollars with a massive campaign staff and on Wiley' suggestions that it was tough preparing Walker for a presidential bid.

After Walker dropped out of the race, one national blogger said Wiley shouldÂ "never, ever work in politics again."Â And theÂ National ReviewÂ said Wiley reminded everyoneÂ "why Republicans hate political consultants."

Reports showed Walker's campaign was still more than $1 million in the hole at the end of 2015.Â Earlier this week, Walker sent out a fundraising emailÂ offering campaign T-shirts to any supporterÂ who gave $45 to help pay off his outstanding debt.

âI cannot stand to see them go to waste,â Walker said in the appeal.
