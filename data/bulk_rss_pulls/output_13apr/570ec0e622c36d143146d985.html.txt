Last week, the New York Daily News did an interview with Bernie Sanders in which Israelâs 2014 assault on Gaza (Operation Protective Edge) came up. When the interview was published, all hell broke loose.

âHe accused us of a blood libel,â Michael Oren, Israelâs former ambassador to the United States, fumed. âHe accused us of bombing hospitals. He accused us of killing 10,000 Palestinian civilians. Donât you think that merits an apology?â An Israeli cabinet minister dismissed Sandersâs âweird and loony statement.â The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) urged Sanders to âcorrect his misstatements.â				
					
					
So, what did Sanders actually say?				
					
					
He said, inter alia, that he supported Israelâs âright to exist as a Jewish stateâ; that âwe cannot ignore the reality that you have large numbers of Palestinians who are suffering now, poverty rate off the charts, unemployment off the charts, Gaza remaining a destroyed areaâ; that Israel âcannot just simply expand when it wants to expand with new settlementsâ¦. the expansion was illegal, moving into territory that was not their territory, I think withdrawal from those territories is appropriateâ; that he âabsolutelyâ condemned âall terrorist acts. The idea that in Gaza there were buildings being used to construct missiles and bombs and tunnels, that is not where foreign aid should goâ; that he opposed Palestinians going to the International Criminal Court; and that he believed Hamas was a âterrorist organization.â				
					
					
None of this is exceptional. Itâs just the ânew normalâ among liberal American Jews.				
					
					
What, then, provoked the hysterical response? The allegedly libelous passages regarding the Israeli assault on Gaza read as follows:				
					
					
I think it is fair to say that the level of attacks against civilian areasâ¦and I do know that the Palestinians, some of them, were using civilian areas to launch missiles. Makes it very difficult. But I think most international observers would say that the attacks against Gaza were indiscriminate and that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed. Look, we are living, for better or worse, in a world of high technology, whether itâs drones out there that could, you know, take your nose off, and Israel has that technology. And I think there is a general belief that, with that technology, they could have been more discriminate in terms of taking out weapons that were threatening them.â¦ Iâm just telling you that I happen to believeâ¦anybody help me out here, because I donât remember the figures, but my recollection is over 10,000 innocent people were killed in Gaza. Does that sound right?â¦ I donât have it in my number [sic]â¦but I think itâs over 10,000. My understanding is that a whole lot of apartment houses were leveled. Hospitals, I think, were bombed. So yeah, I do believe and I donât think Iâm alone in believing that Israelâs force was more indiscriminate than it should have been.

He Also Did Something Else.3Hundreds of People Were Just Arrested Outside Congress4Sanders Is for Schmucks5We Asked 4 Prominent Bernie Supporters if Theyâd Vote for Hillary in November. Hereâs What They Told Us.

Sanders got the casualty figure wrong. Some 2,200 Gazans were killed, of whom approximately 1,500 were civilians, 550 children. But he kept repeating that he couldnât remember the exact number. He also pointed out, âIâm not going to run the Israeli government. Iâve got enough problems trying to be a United States senator or maybe president of the United States.â Is it a sin if a candidate vying for office in an American election and aspiring to serve the American people doesnât remember precisely how many Palestinians were killed in each of Israelâs successive massacres? (Israel has carried out eight major operations against Gaza in the past 12 years.) Itâs also not as if Israel is incapable of killing so many people. It killed 10,000â18,000 Lebanese and Palestinians, overwhelmingly civilians, during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon (Operation Peace for Galilee). Oren says that claiming Israel bombed hospitals during Protective Edge is a blood libel. But Israel did in fact destroy or damage 17 hospitals and 56 primary healthcare centers during the operation. Sanders was also correct in stating that many Gazan dwellings were leveled. In fact, Israel destroyed 19,000 homes.				
			

							“We entered Gaza…with an insane amount of firepower.” —soldier’s testimony (Breaking the Silence)
						
 
The gravamen of Sandersâs criticism is that Israel used âindiscriminateâ force during Protective Edge, âand that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed.â In a subsequent CNN interview, he accused Israel of using âdisproportionateâ force. Were these unreasonable statements? Consider what Israelâs own combatants had to say after Protective Edge. These testimonies were compiled by Breaking the Silence, an Israeli nongovernmental organization comprising former Israeli soldiers. None of the hundreds of eyewitness accounts collected by this organization over more than a decade have ever been exposed as false, and all of them were approved for publication by Israelâs military censor. The politics of Breaking the Silence are not aberrantly leftist (it does not support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or BDS, and opposes criminal prosecution of Israeli officers), while most of the soldier-witnesses do not even appear contrite. The criminal dimensions of Protective Edge can be gleaned from these Israel Defense Forces (IDF) testimonies:				
					
					
When we left after the operation, it was just a barren stretch of desertâ¦. We spoke about it a lot amongst ourselves, the guys from the company, how crazy the amount of damage we did there was. I quote: âListen man, itâs crazy what went on in there,â âListen man, we really messed them up,â âFuck, check it out, thereâs nothing at all leftâ¦, itâs nothing but desert now, thatâs crazy.â

I remember that the level of destruction looked insane to me.				
					
					
*				
					
					
We entered Gazaâ¦with an insane amount of firepower.				
					
					
*				
					
					
It all looked like a science fiction movieâ¦serious levels of destruction everywhere.â¦ [E]verything was really in ruins. And non-stop fire all the time.				
					
					
*				
					
					
Before the entrance on foot [to the Gaza Strip], a crazy amount of artillery was fired at the entire area.â¦ Before a tank makes any movement it fires, every time. Those guys were trigger happy, totally crazy.				
					
					
*				
					
					
The explosionsâ effects cause major amounts of damage, but that doesnât interest anyone. âUse it, use it, explosives canât be taken back,â the platoon commander says, âI donât want to leave explosives on me.â				
					
					
*				
					
					
[Y]ou saw crazy wreckage, it was a real trip.				
					
					
*				
					
					
Our view was of the center of the Strip. Letâs say it was a real fireworks display. From a distance it looked pretty cool.				
					
					
*				
					
					
[Y]ouâre shooting at anything that movesâand also at what isnât moving, crazy amounts.â¦ [I]t also becomes a bit like a computer game, totally cool and real.				
					
					
*				
					
					
It was total destruction in thereâthe photos online are childâs play compared to what we saw there in reality.â¦ I never saw anything like it.				
					
					
*				
					
					
[T]he unfathomable number of dead on one of the sides, the unimaginable level of destruction, the way militant cells and people were regarded as targets and not as living beingsâthatâs something that troubles me.				
					
					
*				
					
					
[I]tâs destruction on a whole other level.				
					
					
*				
					
					
The air force carries out an insane amount of strikes in the Gaza Strip during an operation like âProtective Edge.â				
					
					
*				
					
					
[S]hells are being fired all the time. Even if we arenât actually going to enter: shells, shells, shells.â¦ What happens is, for seven straight days itâs non-stop bombardment, thatâs what happens in practice.

Hereâs What They Told Us.

Sanders got the casualty figure wrong. Some 2,200 Gazans were killed, of whom approximately 1,500 were civilians, 550 children. But he kept repeating that he couldnât remember the exact number. He also pointed out, âIâm not going to run the Israeli government. Iâve got enough problems trying to be a United States senator or maybe president of the United States.â Is it a sin if a candidate vying for office in an American election and aspiring to serve the American people doesnât remember precisely how many Palestinians were killed in each of Israelâs successive massacres? (Israel has carried out eight major operations against Gaza in the past 12 years.) Itâs also not as if Israel is incapable of killing so many people. It killed 10,000â18,000 Lebanese and Palestinians, overwhelmingly civilians, during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon (Operation Peace for Galilee). Oren says that claiming Israel bombed hospitals during Protective Edge is a blood libel. But Israel did in fact destroy or damage 17 hospitals and 56 primary healthcare centers during the operation. Sanders was also correct in stating that many Gazan dwellings were leveled. In fact, Israel destroyed 19,000 homes.				
			

							“We entered Gaza…with an insane amount of firepower.” —soldier’s testimony (Breaking the Silence)
						
 
The gravamen of Sandersâs criticism is that Israel used âindiscriminateâ force during Protective Edge, âand that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed.â In a subsequent CNN interview, he accused Israel of using âdisproportionateâ force. Were these unreasonable statements? Consider what Israelâs own combatants had to say after Protective Edge. These testimonies were compiled by Breaking the Silence, an Israeli nongovernmental organization comprising former Israeli soldiers. None of the hundreds of eyewitness accounts collected by this organization over more than a decade have ever been exposed as false, and all of them were approved for publication by Israelâs military censor. The politics of Breaking the Silence are not aberrantly leftist (it does not support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or BDS, and opposes criminal prosecution of Israeli officers), while most of the soldier-witnesses do not even appear contrite. The criminal dimensions of Protective Edge can be gleaned from these Israel Defense Forces (IDF) testimonies:				
					
					
When we left after the operation, it was just a barren stretch of desertâ¦. We spoke about it a lot amongst ourselves, the guys from the company, how crazy the amount of damage we did there was. I quote: âListen man, itâs crazy what went on in there,â âListen man, we really messed them up,â âFuck, check it out, thereâs nothing at all leftâ¦, itâs nothing but desert now, thatâs crazy.â

If blood libel denotes false representations of the Jewish people that induce anti-Semitism, then the likes of Oren and the ADL, who pretend to represent the Jewish people as they whitewash Israelâs criminal conduct, incarnate a blood libel. By contrast, Sandersâs noble candidacyâhis identification with the underdog and, yes, his recognition of Palestinian sufferingâis a redemptive moment in the saga of modern American Jewry.				
					
					
		

None of this is exceptional. Itâs just the ânew normalâ among liberal American Jews.				
					
					
What, then, provoked the hysterical response? The allegedly libelous passages regarding the Israeli assault on Gaza read as follows:				
					
					
I think it is fair to say that the level of attacks against civilian areasâ¦and I do know that the Palestinians, some of them, were using civilian areas to launch missiles. Makes it very difficult. But I think most international observers would say that the attacks against Gaza were indiscriminate and that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed.

If blood libel denotes false representations of the Jewish people that induce anti-Semitism, then the likes of Oren and the ADL, who pretend to represent the Jewish people as they whitewash Israelâs criminal conduct, incarnate a blood libel.

							“We entered Gaza…with an insane amount of firepower.” —soldier’s testimony (Breaking the Silence)
						


The gravamen of Sandersâs criticism is that Israel used âindiscriminateâ force during Protective Edge, âand that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed.â In a subsequent CNN interview, he accused Israel of using âdisproportionateâ force.

The explosionsâ effects cause major amounts of damage, but that doesnât interest anyone. âUse it, use it, explosives canât be taken back,â the platoon commander says, âI donât want to leave explosives on me.â

To avoid mind-numbing redundancy, this table omits the succession of combatants who testified that the Israeli armyâs modus operandi during the operation was shoot to kill anything that moves, often on explicit orders, but also because it was âcool.â				
					
					
If blood libel denotes false representations of the Jewish people that induce anti-Semitism, then the likes of Oren and the ADL, who pretend to represent the Jewish people as they whitewash Israelâs criminal conduct, incarnate a blood libel. By contrast, Sandersâs noble candidacyâhis identification with the underdog and, yes, his recognition of Palestinian sufferingâis a redemptive moment in the saga of modern American Jewry.

 Norman G. Finkelstein
 Norman G. Finkelstein has written several books on the Israel-Palestine conflict, including Knowing Too Much: Why the American Jewish Romance with Israel Is Coming to an End (OR Books, 2012) and, most recently,Â Method and Madness: The Hidden Story of Israel's Assaults on Gaza (OR Books, 2014).Â

The Israeli government has long held the Palestinians as third class citizens in a state of apartheid. If you have ever been there, you know, it is obvious. if you haven&apos;t been there, go. It is a great visit to a truly historic place and you will see for yourself what is obvious, Israel treats the Palestinians as lesser people and apartheid is alive, real and awful.

Indigenous People of the holy land of all religions and races have a right to exist as much as anyone else in the Holy Land, Jewish culture notwithstanding, or else the concept of God is nothing more than "conqueror" and religion is nothing more than a filthy dirty corrupted army.

As a Jew who supports Israel, I completely agree with this article. I support Israel the same way I support America: as a country whose right to exist shouldn&apos;t be questioned, but whose leadership is often dangerously wrong. I equate Netanyahu with Bush and Cheney. I hate them and the destruction they caused, but I don&apos;t hate the countries that foolishly elected them. The power of the elite to win elections is strong.

Thanks, Norman. It takes guts to stand against the establishment and tell it like it is. 
You mentioned B.D.S. I understand that it was one of the most effective strategies in ridding South Africa of the brutal and racist white supremacist leaders. Might it not be effective in getting Israel to end its brutal and racist occupation of Palestine? Please tell us your thoughts.

It is my understanding that Norm Finkelstein does not support the BDS movement -- for reasons he elucidates in the following dialogue with Al Jazeera&apos;s Mehdi Hasan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EKAb8Rd_8E

While I&apos;m not sure I ultimately agree with Mr. Finkelstein&apos;s position on this issue (BDS), I have to say that I admire him greatly. (Also, he&apos;s superb in this interview. Hasan is a very good, aggressive interviewer, and he gets very forceful with Norman, at one point. Finkelstein&apos;s feisty, principled response is a thing of beauty.)

Israel is quite enthusiastic about advocating for boycotts and sanctions directed at certain other nations.

Thank you for this article underscoring the wanton destruction in Palestine committed by the Israeli armed forces. If there is any libel going on, Mr. Sanders is on the receiving end.
