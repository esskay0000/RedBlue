Paul Ryanâs political operation took in more than $17 million in the first quarter of 2016 â a striking sign of his fundraising prowess since becoming House speaker.

Most of that (roughly $11.1 million) went to the National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to elect GOP House members.

Another large chunk (about $4.6 million) went to Ryanâs own re-election campaign. It now has $7.6 million in cash on hand, likely to be the most of anyone running for the House this year when first-quarter filings are complete.

The fundraising figures were provided by the speakerâs political team. The finance report for âTeam Ryan,â as the Speakerâs joint fundraising committee is known, will be filed Wednesday.

The committee raises money for a variety of entities that are governed by different contribution limits. The biggest recipients are the NRCC and Ryanâs own re-election. The committee was created last fall after Ryan became speaker, and has now raised $23.5 million in roughly five months.

That easily outstrips the fundraising pace set by Ryanâs predecessor, John Boehner, who was considered a prodigious fundraiser for the party. Fundraising rules have been liberalized in the past two years to make it easier for joint fundraising committees like Ryan's to accept large donations. Â But even before Ryan became speaker, the former vice presidential candidate had a track record of raising large sums for the party and for his own campaigns.

Ryan has kept up a heavy fundraising and travel schedule as speaker, though he has stuck by his highly publicized insistence (made at the time he agreed to serve as speaker) of weekends at home in Wisconsin, according to aides. His political travel schedule in the first quarter included stops in 34 cities and 14 states, they said.

Ryan faces a GOP primary opponent in Wisconsin's 1st District this summer, a businessman named Paul Nehlen who has launched a âDump Ryanâ campaign, attacked the Speaker on spending, trade and immigration and criticized him for the amount of money he has raised from outside his district.

The Ryan campaign has declined to comment on Nehlen. No fundraising numbers are available for Nehlen because he just filed his statement of candidacy two weeks ago.
