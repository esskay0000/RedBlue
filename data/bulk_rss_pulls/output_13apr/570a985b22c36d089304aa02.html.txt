A rumour has been circulating online that the 2016 Eurovision entrant for Belarus, IVAN (real nameÂ Alexander Ivanov) wants to perform his song 'Help you Fly' in the NUDE with a couple of live wolves by his side, onstage at Stockholm this year.

The rumour was initially dismissed by many as silly gossip. Eurovision's strict rules are pretty clear about no live animals being allowed onstage - and nudity would just be downright scandalous!

Â 

Now though, video footage has emerged via Russian website LifeNews.ruÂ that show the young star making good on this suggestion (at least at the rehearsal phase) as he is shown singing his track 'Help You Fly' onstage to a pair of actual live wolves, wearing nothing but his birthday suit! Â 

Â 

Check it out below. Be warned though Â - it's NSFW!



Â 

Enjoy that footage while you can though - because it's highly unlikely IVAN will be allowed to get away with it onstage at the main event - although his team remain optimistic!

Â 

"We havenât received any answer from the organisers yet," the singerâs producer Viktor Drobish told LifeNews.ru. "But yes, Sasha will be naked on stage and there will be wolves."

Â 

So what exactly is the significance of the animals?

Â 

"Every person identifies himself with a certain totemic creature," Drobrish explained. "Sometimes we suppress it in ourselves but sometimes we have to face it. We want everybody to feel the thin line between humans and nature."

Â 

21-year-oldÂ IVAN won his spot in Stockholm at the Belarusian national final this year and his song was written byÂ Victor Drobysh, the Russian composer and producer, famous for penning lyrics to 'Party For Everybody', the catchy dance tune sung by the Russian grannies Buranovskiye Babushki in 2012.
