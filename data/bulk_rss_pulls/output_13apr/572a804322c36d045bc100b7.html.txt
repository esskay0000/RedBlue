 

The team behind There Goes the Neighborhood talks about what theyâve learned throughout the process of making the podcast, and how to move forward in a post-gentrified Brooklyn. Where do we go from here? How do we reconcile with what now seems the inevitability of gentrificationânot just in Brooklyn but nationwide?
