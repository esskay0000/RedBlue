Ruling could ultimately lead to the loss of billions in federal education money

Republicans call it âover-reachâ by the Obama administration

Department gives lawmakers until Monday to âremedyâ the situation

 U.S. Justice Department officials rebuked North Carolinaâs House Bill 2 on Wednesday, telling Gov. Pat McCrory that the law violates the U.S. Civil Rights Act and Title IX â a finding that could jeopardize billions in federal education funding.

The department gave state officials until Monday to respond âby confirming that the State will not comply with or implement HB2.â

The letter says HB2, which pre-empted Charlotteâs anti-discrimination ordinance, violates Title IX, which bars discrimination in education based on sex, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bans employment discrimination.

If the finding is upheld, North Carolina could lose federal education funding. During the current school year, state public schools received $861 million. In 2014-2015, the University of North Carolina system got $1.4 billion. 

The Republican-controlled General Assembly passed HB2 in March in response to Charlotteâs extension of its anti-discrimination ordinance. That ordinance would have allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify and would have extended anti-discrimination protections to LGBT residents. HB2 pre-empted that ordinance and defined gender as the sex people were born with.

The law sparked a national firestorm. Amid calls for boycotts of the state, at least two companies announced plans not to relocate or expand in North Carolina. The NBA is considering moving its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte.

Speaking to business leaders Wednesday night, McCrory called the letter âWashington overreach like weâve never seen in our lifetime.â GOP lawmakers also criticized the Justice Department â and President Barack Obama.

House Speaker Tim Moore, who said the GOP leaders are consulting attorneys about a response, called the letter âa huge over-reach (by) the federal government.â

âIt looks an awful lot like politics to me,â Moore, a Kings Mountain Republican, told reporters. âI guess President Obama, in his final months in office, has decided to take up this ultra-liberal agenda.â

Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger called the ruling âa gross overreach â¦ that deserves to be struck down in federal court.â And Lt. Gov. Dan Forest blasted the Obama administration.

âTo use our children and their educational futures as pawns to advance an agenda that will ultimately open those same children up to exploitation at the hands of sexual predators is by far, the sickest example of the depths the â¦ administration will stoop to (to) âfundamentally transform our nation,ââ he said.

But opponents of HB2 applauded the Justice Department finding.

âThe letter confirms what weâve already known â that HB2 is deeply discriminatory, violates federal civil rights law, and needs to be repealed as soon as possible,â said Rep. Chris Sgro, a Democrat who is executive director of Equality NC. âWeâve already lost $500 million in economic impact and now we are violating federal civil rights law and risking Title IX funding.â

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nationâs largest gay rights group, commended âthe Justice Department for enforcing the rule of law and protecting the rights of North Carolinians.

âWe once again urge Gov. McCrory and the state of North Carolina to immediately do the same and fully repeal this harmful bill,â he said.

Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts declined to comment.

The Justice Department letter came two days after the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission posted a fact sheet reiterating its stance that itâs a civil rights violation to deny transgender employees access to a bathroom based on gender identity.

That fact sheet refers to a 2015 decision in which the EEOC ruled that a civilian transgender woman working for the Army had been discriminated against when she was banned from using the common womenâs restroom and forced to use a single bathroom. 

Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who has followed the HB2 legal issues, said the Justice Department letter was similar to one sent by the federal Education Department in the case of the Virginia transgender teen battling a bathroom ban in the Gloucester County school system.

âThey might all be coordinating the federal response,â Tobias said.

He said the letter puts âthe ball in North Carolinaâs court.â

âThere may be some opportunity for North Carolina to appeal,â he said, adding that the governor could challenge the action that the Justice Department plans to take.

If negotiations failed and the Justice Department withheld money, Tobias said the state could sue the federal government in a case that likely would start in federal district court, either in North Carolina or Washington, D.C.

In a statement, new UNC System President Margaret Spellings, who took office in March, said, âWe take this determination seriously and will be conferring with the Governorâs Office, legislative leaders, and counsel about next steps and will respond to the Department by its May 9 deadline.â

Already a political issue in an election year, Wednesdayâs letter raised it to the top.

âEnough is enough,â said Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, McCroryâs opponent. âItâs time for the governor to put our schools and economy first and work to repeal this devastating law.â

Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Deborah Ross called on Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr to âwork to put an end to this law.â

In the Justice Department letter, Vanita Gupta, principal deputy assistant attorney general, said, âHB 2 â¦ is facially discriminatory against transgender employees on the basis of sex because it treats transgender employees, whose gender identity does not match their biological sex, as defined by HB2, differently from similarly situated non transgender employees.â

She went on to say the department âconcluded that â¦ the state is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII rights by employees of public agenciesâ¦â
