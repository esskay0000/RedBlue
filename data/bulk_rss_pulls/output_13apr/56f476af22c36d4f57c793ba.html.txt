Within hours of the terror attacks in Brussels, Senator Ted Cruz sent out a press release that declared, âThe days of the United States voluntarily surrendering to the enemy to show how progressive and enlightened we are at an end.â

The Texas senator and presidential candidate called for more security on the southern border and said the United States needs to âhalt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.â He also advanced a radical idea: âWe need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.â
Cruzâs campaign did not reply to immediate requests for clarification, but this proposal raises several questions: What powers would Cruz grant law enforcement that it doesnât already have? How does one identify what is, and is not, a Muslim neighborhood? What does it mean to âsecureâ the area? Would non-Muslims in that area also be subject to law enforcement surveillance and unspecified âsecuringâ? How are these law-enforcement actions constitutionally permissibleÂ âbeforeâ  there is any radicalization present?
Cruz has argued several cases before the Supreme Court and is frequently hailed as a âfull-spectrum Constitutional conservativeâ on the campaign trail. At the rallies I attended in Iowa and New Hampshire, Cruz often spoke of âreligious libertyâ in the context of perceived attacks by the Obama administration on Christian groups in the United States, as well as on active-duty soldiers, who Cruz claimed were forbidden from praying. (They are not.)
While the details of this proposal are still unclearâI will update if the campaign respondsâthey rang alarm bells among constitutional experts. âProfiling people based on their religion or race is blatantly unconstitutional and violates the guarantee of religious protection and religious freedom,â said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLUâs national-security project, in a phone interview. 
âOne way to look at it is to replace the word âMuslimâ with âJewish,â âChristian,â âAfrican American,â or âLatino.â Whatâs wrong in one context is wrong in others,â Shamsi added.
This new position is somewhat of a shift for Cruz: after the attacks in San Bernardino, he explicitly rejected Republican calls for more surveillance by the National Security Agency. âHoarding tens of billions of records of ordinary citizens did not stop Fort Hood, it didnât stop Boston, it didnât stop Chattanooga, it didnât stop Garland, and it failed to detect the San Bernardino plotters,â he said at the time.

Cruz laterÂ rejected Donald Trumpâs proposed âdatabaseâ of Muslim citizens, and said, âThe First Amendment protects religious liberty.â Cruz has advocated for surveilling mosques, but only when there is specific evidence of a threat. âThe federal government can go and apprehend us in the church and they can monitor us if we are carrying out criminal conduct,â he said in December interview on SiriusXM. âAnd the way the Fourth Amendment works, the Bill of Rights work, is you have particularized evidence of criminal conduct and you target the terrorist and not the law-abiding citizens.â
Now Cruz appears to have made a dramatic shift. Polls have consistently shown that Republican primary voters strongly support banning Muslims from entering the country, and thereâs an increasing belief even among longtime Republicans that Trump is fulfilling the desire of some voters for a âstrongman.â As Cruz tries desperately to win votes and deny Trump the clean majority of Republican delegates needed before the party convention, he may have calculated thatÂ doubling down on Trumpâs ugly, no-holds-barred approach to (ostensibly) combating terrorism will help him.
There were some recent signposts on Cruzâs road to this point whenÂ he added several foreign policy advisers with extreme anti-Muslim pasts to his campaign last week. Frank Gaffney, for example, leads an organization that the Southern Policy Law Center has designated a hate group, and has pushed outlandish theories that Obama is a Muslim andÂ that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie may be guilty of âtreasonâ for appointing a Muslim-American judge. (When asked on CNN about Gaffney last week, Cruz said, âI recognize that folks in the media get really nervous when you actually call out radical Islamic terrorism. Frank Gaffney is someone I respect.â)
Another Cruz adviser, Clare Lopez, declared in a recent radio interview that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the federal government. âBrotherhood affiliates and associates and those connected to it are the go-to advisers, if not appointees, for the top levels of national security in our government, in this administration for sure, but going back many decades, really, is the program of this Brotherhood,â she claimed in remarks flagged by Right Wing Watch. She added that Senator Joseph McCarthy âwas spot-on in just about everything he said about the levels of infiltrationâ in the 1950s, which echoes Gaffneyâs belief that the House Un-American Activities Committee should be reinstated.

Cruz laterÂ rejected Donald Trumpâs proposed âdatabaseâ of Muslim citizens, and said, âThe First Amendment protects religious liberty.â Cruz has advocated for surveilling mosques, but only when there is specific evidence of a threat. âThe federal government can go and apprehend us in the church and they can monitor us if we are carrying out criminal conduct,â he said in December interview on SiriusXM. âAnd the way the Fourth Amendment works, the Bill of Rights work, is you have particularized evidence of criminal conduct and you target the terrorist and not the law-abiding citizens.â
Now Cruz appears to have made a dramatic shift. Polls have consistently shown that Republican primary voters strongly support banning Muslims from entering the country, and thereâs an increasing belief even among longtime Republicans that Trump is fulfilling the desire of some voters for a âstrongman.â As Cruz tries desperately to win votes and deny Trump the clean majority of Republican delegates needed before the party convention, he may have calculated thatÂ doubling down on Trumpâs ugly, no-holds-barred approach to (ostensibly) combating terrorism will help him.
There were some recent signposts on Cruzâs road to this point whenÂ he added several foreign policy advisers with extreme anti-Muslim pasts to his campaign last week. Frank Gaffney, for example, leads an organization that the Southern Policy Law Center has designated a hate group, and has pushed outlandish theories that Obama is a Muslim andÂ that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie may be guilty of âtreasonâ for appointing a Muslim-American judge. (When asked on CNN about Gaffney last week, Cruz said, âI recognize that folks in the media get really nervous when you actually call out radical Islamic terrorism. Frank Gaffney is someone I respect.â)
Another Cruz adviser, Clare Lopez, declared in a recent radio interview that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the federal government. âBrotherhood affiliates and associates and those connected to it are the go-to advisers, if not appointees, for the top levels of national security in our government, in this administration for sure, but going back many decades, really, is the program of this Brotherhood,â she claimed in remarks flagged by Right Wing Watch. She added that Senator Joseph McCarthy âwas spot-on in just about everything he said about the levels of infiltrationâ in the 1950s, which echoes Gaffneyâs belief that the House Un-American Activities Committee should be reinstated.

Ted "The Sludge" tries AGAIN for a power-chord, breaks yet another string. What a defective Putz.

The degree to which we tolerate division by religion is a measure of our insanity. http://thelastwhy.ca/poems/2013/1/25/religion.html
