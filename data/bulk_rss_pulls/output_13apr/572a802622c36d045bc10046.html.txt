Oh, Bill.

While campaigning for wife Hillary Clinton onÂ Wednesday in San Diego, Bill Clinton lamented that it hadÂ been a while since a girl has told him he looked great.

"I still feel young," Clinton began, before a woman interrupted him from the crowd.

"You look great!" she said.

"Been a long time since a girl said that to me," said Clinton, who had an affair with a woman 27 years his junior while president of the United States.

The crowd cheered. Clinton continued.

"I usually get, 'You look good for a man your age,' " he said. "That last phrase is a killer."
