President Obama, responding to the request of an 8-year-old girl from Flint, Mich., will travel there in a week to talk with residents concerned about the high level of lead contamination in their water.

Mari Copeny, who acquired the nickname Little Miss Flint for her vocal activism on the issue of lead exposure, wrote Obama last month when she was preparing to come to D.C. to watch Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) testify before the House Oversight Committee on his state's handling of the issue. Snyder, as well as the state's Department of Environmental Quality and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, have come under fire for not acting sooner to limit lead contamination coming from the city's aging pipe system.

"I know this is probably an odd request but I would love for a chance to meet you or your wife," Mari wrote. "My mom said chances are you will be too busy with more important things, but there is a lot of people coming on these buses and even just a meeting from you or your wife would really lift peopleâs spirits."

Obama responded in a letter on Monday, which the White House posted Wednesday on the site Medium. He noted that she was "right that Presidents are often busy, but the truth is, in America, no title is more important than citizen."

"I want to make sure people like you and your family are receiving the help you need and deserve," the president wrote, adding he wanted her to be "the first to know" that he's coming to her city on May 4. "Like you, I'll use my voice to call for change and help lift upÂ your community."

Flint's water contamination became a major issue in the presidential race around Michigan's primary, as Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders cited it as a sign of Republican politicians' indifference to those who are poor and African American, while Republicans said Obama administration officials bore part of the blame for the problem. An ongoing state probe has faulted Michigan officials for making the key decisions that have exposed thousands of children in the community to dangerously high lead levels that can causeÂ permanent neurological problems.

For decades, Flint had purchased its water from Detroit. It came from Lake Huron, with anti-corrosion chemicals added along the way.Â But as the once-thriving, now-struggling industrial city sought ways to trim its budget under the watch of an emergency manager appointed by the state, officials in 2014 switched the cityâs water source to the Flint River.

State officials, however, fatefully failed to ensure the addition of chemicals intended to control the corrosion of pipes and prevent lead and other contaminants from leaching into the water. Eventually, more than 95,000 residents in the troubled city â including about 9,000 children under age 6 â were exposed to water tainted with lead and other potential contaminants.

Last month, a task force appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) to investigate the water crisis in Flint issued a blistering report, largely blaming state officials in what it called âa story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice.â

The report said the state Environmental Quality Department âfailed in its fundamental responsibilityâ to enforce drinking-water regulations, even as it assured top state that Flintâs water was safe when it wasnât. It faulted Snyder and his administration for failing to act even afterÂ  senior staff members raised the issue.

It said Flintâs water department ârushed unpreparedâ into switching to a new water source in 2014. And it blamed the Environmental Protection Agencyâs delayed enforcement of federal drinking-water standards for âprolonging the calamity.â

Last week, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced criminal charges against three government employees for their role in the ongoing water crisis in Flint. The charges include more than a dozen separate counts â including tampering with evidence and misconduct in office â against two officials at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, as well as a Flint water quality supervisor.

âThese charges are only the beginning, and there will be more to come,â Schuette said at the time.
