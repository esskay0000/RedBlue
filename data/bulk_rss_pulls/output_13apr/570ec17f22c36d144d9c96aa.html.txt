Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN)Ted Cruz's resounding win in Colorado's GOP contest this weekend provided fresh evidence that Donald Trump's campaign is still scrambling to catch up in the state-by-state delegate hunt.

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair!

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!
