U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, on Tuesday offered no comment on an awkward sing-along and inaccurateÂ comments heÂ made at a pre-primary campaign event forÂ Hillary Clinton in Wilmington Monday.

CarperÂ duringÂ a rally atÂ World CafÃ© Live at the Queen on Market Street offeredÂ support for the presidential candidate with a rendition of the Donna Summer classic "She Works Hard For the Money."

"We're going to channel Donna Summer her for a minute, OK? Here we go!" he half-shouted to the crowd of an estimated 700.Â "This is the audience participation part of the show."

And then, in a sing-songy moment, said:Â "She works hard for the money. So hard for the money. She works hard for the money, so we'd better treat her right."

The crowd joined in.

"Tomorrow we're going to treat her right tomorrow?" Carper asked the crowd. "She will treat this country right."

He also calledÂ Clinton a former governor and member of the House of Representatives, neither of which is true.

Video of Carper'sÂ 10-minute speechÂ spread on social media and was picked up by several media outlets, where commentators pointed out the irony of the song being referenced. Clinton's income and money made from speeches she made toÂ Goldman Sachs and other big firms has been a reoccurringÂ campaign issue with opponent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.

CarperÂ press secretary Katie WilsonÂ in an email Tuesday said the senatorÂ wasÂ in session inÂ Washington, D.C.,Â Tuesday and would not be able to discuss the rally before the end of the day. She added that he would be releasing a statement about "the primary results in general," butÂ not his comments about Clinton.

Carper, who is a superdelegate in the primary, served with ClintonÂ in the U.S. Senate between 2001 and 2009, when she became secretary of state.

Carper during the speech Monday also referred to Sanders, who also is aÂ Senate colleague.Â The senator attested thatÂ he has, on occasion, "felt the Bern." He alsoÂ had the crowd chant "Joe-Bama, Joe-Bama," a reference to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

Clinton was about an hour late to the rally and Carper and other officials spoke until the candidate arrived.

Carper hasn't beenÂ the only one to get confused. Both Clinton's daughter and husband have eitherÂ goofed or glossed over parts of her resume andÂ platform, reports show. And Paul Brewer, director at the University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication, says Carper's speech isn't likely to have a negative impact on Clinton's campaign.

"In my own professional opinion, he probably doesn't have a future as an R&B singer," BrewerÂ said with a chuckle. More seriously, "It wasn't the candidate herself. It was her surrogate. I don't think it will be reallyÂ controversial or harmful to her campaign."

Maybe if he hasÂ to do it over again, Carper should pick a different song, Brewer said. But this is nothing like Marco Rubio's disastrous "Marcobot"Â debate gaffe â Rubio repeated a memorized 25-second speech three times in a row, making himself look like a robot.

Clinton herself was on point Monday and is expected to win the primary in Delaware.

The incident is unlikely to affect Carper's political career either, Brewer said.

"It was a funny, little awkward moment of laughter," he said. But in past pollingÂ by the center, "his approval rating has always been quite high."

In fact, some of Carper's past "antics"Â have only made people like him even more. In 2012, he hopped up on a table to do several push-ups, not only provoking laughsÂ but dispelling rumors he was in bad health.
