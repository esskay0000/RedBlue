Four menÂ have been arrested in Honduras for theÂ killing of Berta CÃ¡ceresâtwo of them associated with the company building the dam sheÂ was fighting to stop. As Nina Lakhani reported in The Guardian, âJust days before her death, she accused the Honduran company behind the dam, Desarrollos EnergÃ©ticos SA (DESA), of using local thugs to terrorize her and COPINH [her organization] as they tried to mobilize opposition to its revised plan to dam their sacred river, the Gualcarque. The Honduran state was complicit in this intimidation, she alleged.â

						});
					
According to The New York Times, one of the men arrested, âSergio RodrÃ­guez Orellana, is a manager for social and environmental issues for DESAâ¦. A second suspect, Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, had worked in the past for a security company hired by the dam project, DESA wrote in response to an email.â		
So here you have the two faces of postâCold War repression in Central America: âA security company,â which in Honduras is basically a legalized, open-air version of what used to be called a death squad, often staffed by paramilitaries from front-line countries such as Colombia and Israel (in 2013, CÃ¡ceres said in an interview that Bustillo personally left threats of sexual assault on her cell phone). And the modern public-relations industry, which human- and nature-destroying companies hire to âovercome reputational challenges among the international community,â as one PR firm, working for one of the most repressive Honduran corporations, put it.		
For instance,Â since the release of Jesse Freestonâs excellent documentary, Resistencia,Â on land struggles in the AguÃ¡n Valley, where the Dinant Corporation has been presiding over a regime of terror as it transforms the rainforest into an African-palm plantation (used for biofuels), Iâve been receiving regular e-mails from someone named David Sowells. Sowells works for a DC-based PR firm called Tricuro, on behalf of Dinant (which is owned by the Facusses, one of the richest families in Honduras and very active in the 2009 overthrow of Manuel Zelaya, the coup that Hillary Clinton helped legitimize and which kicked off the latest cycle of repression against activists such as CÃ¡ceres).		
Sowells’s e-mails inform of all the wonderful work Dinant is putting into place to help peasants, including the hiring of a âprofessional social worker to be based within the local communities of the AguÃ¡n near the companyâs African Palm plantations and extraction millâ (perhaps like the one who killed CÃ¡ceres) and the establishment of âcommunity grievanceâ mechanisms. Dinant kills. The community grieves. Ominously, one of Sowells’s e-mails announced, âIn the spirit of open engagement, CorporaciÃ³n Dinant has written to stakeholders and human rights organizations requesting any information they have on alleged incidents that might have occurred on or near Dinantâs property in the AguÃ¡n region of Honduras without the companyâs knowledge. Dinant has pledged to investigate fully and transparently each incident.â Sounds like a self-reporting hotline to a death squad to me. (Greg McCain, writing in Counterpunch, has more on Tricuro, Dinant, the Facusse family, and the AguÃ¡n Valley.)

According to Tricuroâs website, the companyâs expertise lies in âhelping governments to communicate complex and diverse stories to global audiences.â In our postmodern world, state terrorists have learned that, to be effective, they need to do more than just kill and torture. They have to also be able to tell good stories. According to its website, many on Tricuroâs staff have extensive, respectable Beltway lobbying experience. Sowells is a graduate of the London School of EconomicsÂ and a former public affairs director of CNN International and AOL Time Warner Europe. None of them would have found themselves kicking in the kitchen door at midnight and executing an indigenous environmental activist. The company, Dinant, and the family, Facusse, they represent, however, are involved in extractive operations in a region of Honduras that since the 2009 coup has been a war zone. Between 2009Â and 2013 alone, 89Â activists like CÃ¡ceres wereÂ murdered.

The two others who were arrested in CÃ¡ceres’s killing included an active and a retired member of the Honduran military, Mariano DÃ­az ChÃ¡vez and Edison AtilioÂ Duarte Meza, respectively, exposing the public-private nature of Honduran repression.		
CÃ¡ceres’s execution has brought pressure to bear on Honduras, including from the US government, to clean up its act, resulting in a wider investigation into police repression and impunity. According to The New York Times,Â âa steady drumbeat of assassinations of journalists, lawyers, labor and peasant leaders and environmental activists has come to mark Honduran politics ever since a 2009 coup.â As many have noted, including most recently Tim Shorrock in The Nation, it was the United Statesâstarting with Hillary Clintonâs State Departmentâthat was keeping the beat.		
CÃ¡ceresâs murder took place in an unusually interesting Democratic primary cycle, implicating Hillary Clintonâs unforgivable betrayal of Honduran activists and garnering unusual attention in the United States. But Honduras since 2009 reveals a rot that goes beyond Clinton, exposing the many layersâfrom resource extraction to military funding and beltway lobbyingâthat comprise US policy toward Central America.

So our alternative to Bernie is Secretary Clinton?? I&apos;d like to read on her involvement in Colombia and the Clinton&apos;s family association with paramilitary groups lead by former president, and now senator Alvaro Uribe. The idea of a Clinton president gives me the chills. Bernie need to go to the polls as green with Gill Stein, and they&apos;ll win over any of the "lesser of the evils" for sure. We&apos;re ready for a real chance, and it seems this is the right time.
