Mately, a subscription-based STD testing service that is planning to launch an Indiegogo campaign next week, advertises that members can privately share their STD test results with people who they meet on dating apps like Tinder. "Most of the time, we just have to take someone&apos;s word for it," says a talking phone, to its owner, in a promotional video for the idea. "But when it comes to our sexual health, shouldn&apos;t we have information we can trust?" I don&apos;t know how to feel about this. How horrified are you?

Remember those blissful times when ClassPass empowered you to frequent countless bougie studios for just $99 a month? Well.

ClassPass roped us in at $99/month, now wants to charge $190/month FOR THE EXACT SAME SERVICE https://t.co/QytMNdTzYs— Jenna // Wortham (@jennydeluxe) April 27, 2016

ClassPass&apos;s unlimited membership plan will now put you out a cool $190 each month—or $200 if you&apos;re a new member. $200! You may as well head over to Equinox and fill up on Kiehl&apos;s products if you&apos;re forking that over each month. (Plus, Equinox is even cheaper if your company has a corporate discount.)

This comes after ClassPass&apos;s price hike last summer to $125 a month. You can still retain a membership for that price but will be woefully limited to 10 classes each month. 

This prescient tweet from Equinox says it all:

A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Amazon is liable for in-app purchases made by children through its Android and and Kindle Fire marketplace.

The company didn&apos;t do enough to warn parents that even free-to-download apps, such as games, could rack up in-app charges, according to the ruling.

The Federal Trade Commission first filed the case against Amazon in 2014 and says it&apos;s planning to ask the court to award full refunds for kids&apos; purchases. The FTC says it previously settled similar complaints against Apple and Google, getting consumers more than $50 million in refunds. SM

Tinder is experimenting with letting groups of friends match up with other groups, through a new feature it calls Tinder Social.

And while Gizmodo suggests the feature&apos;s really about group, er, hookups, Tinder says it&apos;s just for connecting with other "interesting people" for a classy night on the town—say, drinks at your local Soho House. 

Tinder is currently only testing it with "a small group of users in Australia," though the company says it hopes to launch it more widely soon. 

And if you don&apos;t have a group of friends to swipe with, there are some apps for that too, as I wrote about here.

Good news for those of us who thought the Apple Watch was kind of cool, but didn&apos;t want to shell out $500 for it. We&apos;ll soon be able to find affordably priced and fashionable tech products at Topshop stores. 

Today, the fashion retailer begins inviting entrepreneurs to apply for a competition called Top Pitch, in which they will go through a monthlong program where they will develop a product with the help of tech and fashion mentors. The most promising teams will snag equity investment and could see their product in stores.  ES

Yahoo struck a deal with activist investor Starboard to add four Starboard-approved directors to its board—including Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith.

In exchange, Starboard will drop its bid to replace Yahoo&apos;s entire board as the once-pioneering Internet company weighs potential sale options.

Smith, along with former Deutsche Bank exec Tor Braham, former Tribune Company CEO Eddy Hartenstein, and Tessera Technologies Chairman Richard Hill, will join the board immediately.

Starboard has previously slammed Yahoo and, by extension, CEO Marissa Mayer for what it called "atrocious performance" and "wasteful acquisitions," previously calling for the company to consider a merger with AOL.  SM

Founded by Emily Leproust—one of Fast Company&apos;s most creative people—Twist Bioscience has developed a way to quickly synthesize high-quality DNA. But why is Microsoft interested in this? 

"Today, the vast majority of digital data is stored on media that has a finite shelf life and periodically needs to be re-encoded," Leproust said in a statement. "DNA is a promising storage media, as it has a known shelf life of several thousand years, offers a permanent storage format and can be read for continuously decreasing costs."

Plus, DNA can store staggering amounts of data: As Leproust told TechCrunch, "You could fit all the knowledge in the whole world inside the trunk of your car."  PM

Getty Images is filing a formal complaint with the European Union&apos;s antitrust commission, claiming that Google undercuts its business and encourages photo piracy by making high quality third-party images readily available. From Time: 

In a statement released to TIME ahead of the filing, Getty argues that since image consumption is immediate, "there is little impetus to view the image on the original source site" once it&apos;s seen in high resolution on Google. By making these images available to download, Google has "also promoted piracy, resulting in widespread copyright infringement, turning users into accidental pirates," Getty claims.

• Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales. But don&apos;t worry: the company still has $233,000,000,000 in the bank.

• In Twitter&apos;s Q1 financial results, it revealed a small uptick in users, but not enough to keep stocks from tanking after it missed revenue estimates.

• Amazon is suing five websites that buy and sell fake product reviews. 

• Donald Trump won all five East Coast primaries last night. Hillary Clinton took four out of the five voting states, with Bernie Sanders winning Rhode Island.  RP

Today, Sesame Workshop announces a three-year partnership with IBM to use Watson to create high-tech learning tools for the world&apos;s preschoolers.

The collaboration came about because Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational wing of Sesame Street, wanted to create products and platforms adapted to individual little learners. Studies show that kids learn best when content is customized to their aptitude and learning styles.

Watson&apos;s AI technology will gather data points from millions of preschoolers. It could use this information to say, teach a child how to read using stories that are tailored to their specific experiences and family background.

Sesame Workshop hopes to have new Watson-powered products by the end of this year.

HTC, maker of the high-end Vive virtual reality system, today announced a $100 million VR startup accelerator.

Known as Vive X, the program "is designed to help cultivate, foster and grow the global VR ecosystem by supporting start-ups and providing them with expertise, special access to advanced VR technology, financial investment, mentorship and unmatched go-to-market support," says a company statement.

Vive X will get started next month in Beijing, Taipei, and San Francisco, as well as other cities before long.

Applications are now being accepted. DT



The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Ben Fritz, Dana Mattioli, and Erich Schwartzel are reporting that Comcast is in talks to acquire DreamWorks Animation, the studio headed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, for more than $3 billion. If completed, the deal would add another major producer of content to Comcast&apos;s portfolio. And it would put DreamWorks, whose franchises include the Kung Fu Panda series,  under the same ownership as Comcast&apos;s Illumination Entertainment, part of Comcast&apos;s Universal Pictures and producer of the Despicable Me and Minions animated features—a situation with the potential to be roughly akin to Disney&apos;s ownership of both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar.
