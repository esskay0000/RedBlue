Bill Clinton has a heated exchange with a protester during a rally for Hillary Clinton, April 7, 2016, in Philadelphia. (Ed Hille / The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP)

âI know those young people were just trying to get good television,â saidÂ Hillary Clintonâs husband as he reflected on his earlierÂ decision to go horns-first after Black Lives Matter protesters. Imagine, for a moment, if George W. Bush had said those words after being confronted by angry Iraq War veterans. Instead, the ex-president is Bill Clinton, and the protesters were young African Americans whose parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors still endure the consequences of his 1994 Violent Crime Control and Enforcement Act.

The 1994 crime bill is, like the Iraq war, an unwelcome guest continually showing up at feel-good candidate events. Twenty-two years ago, William Jefferson Clinton instigated the bill; Hillary Clinton lobbied for it; Bernie Sanders, then in the House, voted for it, reluctantly, after denouncing its core provisions. In recent months, both Clintons have stepped away from the crime billâs legacy, allowing that, in the former presidentâs words, âtoo many laws were overly broad instead of appropriately tailored.â Candidate Hillary now declares that âthe era of mass incarceration must end,â without quite saying who inaugurated it. But with 2.3 million Americans in behind bars and policing abuses a national scandal, the crime bill just keeps coming back.				
					
					
Since 1994, the text of that crime bill has sat on my shelf by my desk: 356 pages of it, 33 separate titles, dozens of subsections. For many months back then, I covered the intense debate over that sweeping and dangerous bill. As this yearâs campaign has unfolded, I have been troubled by the Clinton campaign’s portrayal of todayâs obscene level of incarceration as the accidental byproduct of a well-intentioned, universally supported, and thoroughly justified effort to address violent crime. The latest version of this shoulder-shrug: ex-President Clintonâs stunning outburst at activists this week: âI donât know how you would characterize gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children.â¦ Maybe you thought they were good citizens.â				
					
					
Hereâs the reality: In the late 1980s and early â90s, the thriving crack market, combined with massive unregulated gun trafficking, drove a catastrophic spike in the murder rate in many inner cities. But except for a handful of provisionsâassault-weapons regulation, grants for community policing and hiring copsâmost of the 1994 crime bill had nothing to do with that problem. To read the billâs full text today feels like stumbling upon a prophecy calling out everything that has since gone wrong with the criminal-justice system:				
					
					

Subsidies for state prison expansion
A brutally inflexible federal three-strikes law ensuring that record numbers of prisoners would remain locked up for nonviolent and second-tier felonies
Abolition of federal Pell grants for prisonersâ college tuition, ensuring that paroled offenders return to their communities without having had a chance to advance their education past high school
Enthusiastic promotion of mandatory minimum sentences
13-year-old offenders tried as adults
A vastly expanded federal death penalty, imposed just as growing numbers of states were backing away from capital punishment
A tidal wave of military gear arriving at local police departments, bigger than the arsenals of many nations

None of thisâcontrary to this yearâs campaign mythologyâwas a fait accompli. Back in 1994, criminologists, civil-rights lawyers, community activists, and members of Congress all fought against various provisions of the bill. A hundred and sixty-nine members of the House, including Representative Ron Dellums, co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, voted against it. So did 34 senators. That it passed at all was a tribute to the Clinton administrationâs cynical decision to bundle mandatory minimums and prison expansion with the Violence Against Women Act and weapons regulation, making it harder for uneasy progressives to just say no.

Hereâs What They Told Us.
And hereâs the irony: By the time the crime bill was passed, violent crime was already on the way down. By 1995, the first year crime-bill funds found their way to states and cities, homicide was at the lowest level since the Reagan era, driven by changes in the drug market and other developments unrelated to Clintonâs tough-on-crime campaign.				
			

							Neither the 1994 crime bill nor Hillary Clinton’s remarks about bringing teenage offenders “to heel” were a misstep.
						
 
Not that it mattered, since the 1994 crime bill was never mostly about crime. It was designed from the beginning as a political symbol. Back in the 1990s, crime was to Bill Clinton as illegal immigration is to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz today: a way of reassuring fearful, alienated white voters, especially in the South. Fear of offenders, fear of gangs, fear of ungovernable teenage âsuperpredatorsâ (a supposed generational wolf-pack who never actually appeared): Those were the political currency of the era. Like other New Democrats, Clinton had years earlier decided that the party’s best hope to win those voters back into the fold was to align themselves with a more conservative criminal-justice policy. This rallying cry resounded throughout the eight years of his presidency. Neither the 1994 bill nor Hillary Clintonâs ghastly remarks a year after the crime billâs passage about bringing teenage offenders âto heelâ were a one-off misstep. Fear of crime was the beating heart of Bill Clintonâs domestic policy.

Why is all of this relevant now? First of all, memory should count for something. If it matters that Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War, it matters that she lobbied for a crime bill which many sensible progressives opposed. It is reasonable to ask whether a presidential candidate who still wonât reckon with her political choices 22 years ago is going to be hard-headed and frank about facing down unpopular decisions.				
					
					
The reopening of the emotional debate over this two-decade-old legislative package also shows just how much the country has been changed intellectually by Barack Obamaâs presidency. The Clinton team of the 1990s hoped to rebuild a Democratic majority by seizing Republican terrain in the culture war, national security, economic deregulation, and crime. Now marriage equality is the law; voters turn a jaundiced eye on bloody foreign adventures; most of the public recognizes free trade deals as job-destruction programs. And as states go bankrupt paying for overcrowded prisons, even Republicans are sick of the war on drugs and videos of beat-down policing on YouTube.				
			

							President Obama has chipped away with quiet determination at some of the Clinton crime bill’s most toxic legacies.
						
 
The 1994 crime bill matters in this primary not merely as an object lesson in executive-branch opportunism but because the vastly unequal treatment of African Americans from one end of the criminal-justice system to the other remains an unanswered moral and political challenge. Whatever his faults, President Obama has for years chipped away with quiet determination at some of the Clinton crime billâs most toxic legacies: The White House and Justice Department have been commuting sentences, reforming mandatory minimums, giving states unprecedented latitude in marijuana policy, even finding a legal loophole to re-establishing a small number of Pell tuition grants for prisoners as an experimental program without congressional approval.				
					
					
While Secretary Clinton is keen to be identified with President Obamaâs legacy, her participation in the race-drenched crime policies of the 1990s presents her with a dilemmaâand she has yet to fully choose which legacy to embrace. Her criminal-justice policies posted thus far to her website are progressive, but for the most part sound generic, timid, and lacking in specifics or vision. Most people agree on body cams for police; sheâs for that. Extending President Obamaâs legacy of commutation and prisoner-education grants are far more contentious topicsâand thereâs no mention of these crucial, conscience-driven initiatives in her criminal-justice platform.				
					
					
Opportunistic, expensive, racially biased, the crime bill of 1994 wonât go away by itself. That is why it belongs on this yearâs political agenda. The Black Lives Matter protesters who confronted Bill Clinton this week werenât trying to get good television. They were trying to get good leadership.

Fear of offenders, fear of gangs, fear of ungovernable teenage âsuperpredatorsâ (a supposed generational wolf-pack who never actually appeared): Those were the political currency of the era. Like other New Democrats, Clinton had years earlier decided that the party’s best hope to win those voters back into the fold was to align themselves with a more conservative criminal-justice policy. This rallying cry resounded throughout the eight years of his presidency. Neither the 1994 bill nor Hillary Clintonâs ghastly remarks a year after the crime billâs passage about bringing teenage offenders âto heelâ were a one-off misstep. Fear of crime was the beating heart of Bill Clintonâs domestic policy.

Why is all of this relevant now? First of all, memory should count for something. If it matters that Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War, it matters that she lobbied for a crime bill which many sensible progressives opposed. It is reasonable to ask whether a presidential candidate who still wonât reckon with her political choices 22 years ago is going to be hard-headed and frank about facing down unpopular decisions.				
					
					
The reopening of the emotional debate over this two-decade-old legislative package also shows just how much the country has been changed intellectually by Barack Obamaâs presidency. The Clinton team of the 1990s hoped to rebuild a Democratic majority by seizing Republican terrain in the culture war, national security, economic deregulation, and crime. Now marriage equality is the law; voters turn a jaundiced eye on bloody foreign adventures; most of the public recognizes free trade deals as job-destruction programs. And as states go bankrupt paying for overcrowded prisons, even Republicans are sick of the war on drugs and videos of beat-down policing on YouTube.

The 1994 crime bill matters in this primary not merely as an object lesson in executive-branch opportunism but because the vastly unequal treatment of African Americans from one end of the criminal-justice system to the other remains an unanswered moral and political challenge. Whatever his faults, President Obama has for years chipped away with quiet determination at some of the Clinton crime billâs most toxic legacies: The White House and Justice Department have been commuting sentences, reforming mandatory minimums, giving states unprecedented latitude in marijuana policy, even finding a legal loophole to re-establishing a small number of Pell tuition grants for prisoners as an experimental program without congressional approval.				
					
					
While Secretary Clinton is keen to be identified with President Obamaâs legacy, her participation in the race-drenched crime policies of the 1990s presents her with a dilemmaâand she has yet to fully choose which legacy to embrace. Her criminal-justice policies posted thus far to her website are progressive, but for the most part sound generic, timid, and lacking in specifics or vision. Most people agree on body cams for police; sheâs for that. Extending President Obamaâs legacy of commutation and prisoner-education grants are far more contentious topicsâand thereâs no mention of these crucial, conscience-driven initiatives in her criminal-justice platform.				
					
					
Opportunistic, expensive, racially biased, the crime bill of 1994 wonât go away by itself. That is why it belongs on this yearâs political agenda. The Black Lives Matter protesters who confronted Bill Clinton this week werenât trying to get good television. They were trying to get good leadership.				
					
					
		

I Used to Support Bernie, but Then I Changed My Mind

Bernie Rocks Buffalo. He Also Did Something Else.

Hundreds of People Were Just Arrested Outside Congress

Sanders Is for Schmucks

We Asked 4 Prominent Bernie Supporters if Theyâd Vote for Hillary in November. Hereâs What They Told Us.

And hereâs the irony: By the time the crime bill was passed, violent crime was already on the way down. By 1995, the first year crime-bill funds found their way to states and cities, homicide was at the lowest level since the Reagan era, driven by changes in the drug market and other developments unrelated to Clintonâs tough-on-crime campaign.

"ï»¿ The Black Lives Matter protesters who confronted Bill Clinton this week werenât trying to get good television. They were trying to get good leadership". Good luck to us all. Bernie or bust!

I spent half of yesterday arguing with a rabid Clinton supporter/ online friend about this very topic.  She contends that of course the Clinton didn&apos;t mean to hurt black communities with the bill and that, in fact, black leaders "begged" for it.  I couldn&apos;t get her to see my point that the underlying political intent of the bill was that which you lay out here - exploitation of the "black crime" issue for votes.  Even if unintended negative consequences ensued far beyond what they&apos;d forecast, the cynical political calculations behind the bill are what should give us pause in assessing the Clintons&apos; record of judgment.

Shapiro may be correct that some of the motivation for the 1994 Crime Bill was politically motivated.  But so is his retort.  The simple fact is that blacks commit a disproportionate percentage of most crimes.

 But at the same time, minorities are now nearly half of all Democrats.  Since they are critically important to Dem success, it&apos;s now considered essential to disavow the Crime Bill and to misrepresent the facts.  Here&apos;s an example:

"A brutally inflexible federal three-strikes law ensuring that record numbers of prisoners would remain locked up for nonviolent and second-tier felonies."

This may be true at the federal level but it gives the impression that the majority of people are being locked up for petty crimes such as small drug users.  The reality is that the great majority of prisoners are locked up for violent crime (nearly 50%) or serious property crime (another 17%).  See link.

Data in the book Freakonomics credited Roe vs Wade and easier access to abortion for a statistically significant  role in decreased crime in the US; a generation of unwanted children that we&apos;re born into crime...http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/

I&apos;m not convinced by the correlation that they drew between Roe v Wade and violent crime stats. Even a superficial glance, at crime stats from 1960 to the present, shows that crime rates started to climb, peeking in the early 90&apos;s, then began a somewhat steady decline. What should also be taken into account, before the spike in violent crime, is massive change in drug classification and the beginning of drug prohibition. Simply look at the spikes in violent crime during alcohol prohibition, in the 1920&apos;s, and the beginnings of the war on drugs under Nixon. 

All I&apos;m saying is, I&apos;m not sold on abortion being the impetus for reduction in violent crime. This is not intended as a diatribe against abortion.

Maybe a "super politician" can get things done?  If Obama cannot bring congress "to heel," how can Bernie Sanders?  Maybe Hillary would have a better chance even if she lacks empathy, conscience etc.  I like Bernie Sanders and his ideas....but is he a "practical" choice?  I liked Ralph Nader also and we know how that worked out. It was one big  cause of Bush being elected president.  If we eviscerate and/or tear down Hillary too much,  we might wind up with Cruz.  or even Mr. T.

Comparing Nader with Sanders would be unwise. The movement started by Sanders will continue even after the 2016 elections, regardless of who goes to the White House, until the issues he has raised (campaign finance, minimum wage, 1% vs. 99%) are resolved.

Nader was polling at 2%. Bernie Sanders has managed to create what is perhaps a once in a lifetime political movement. If we stand on the sidelines for too long, we will have to come up with creative answers for our grandchildren when they ask what we were doing when Bernie Sanders ran for president. The wrong side of history can be cruel.

The Clintons are what we call "super-politicians."  No conscience, no empathy... we can talk about how they got that way, but first they must be brought to heel!

Goddam that&apos;s freakin witty. I sincerely wish I had thought of that first.
