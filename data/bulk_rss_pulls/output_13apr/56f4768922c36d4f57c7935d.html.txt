So Donald Trump threatened to "spill the beans" on Ted Cruz's wife (metaphorically, we presume?), and Ted Cruz is having none of it.

Cruz called Trump a coward for commenting on his wife, Heidi Cruz. ThenÂ on CNN this morning, he employed a new line that fans of political dramasâÂ both real and fictional â might remember.

"And if Donald wants to get into a character fight, he's better off sticking with me," Cruz said, "because Heidi is way out of his league."

Cruz likes quoting movies and shows. He quotesÂ The Princess Bride, despite Inigo Montoya himself asking Cruz to stop doing so. He also quotesÂ The Simpsons,Â and does a pretty mean Ned Flanders.

So it should surprise no one that, when pressed to defend the woman he loves, Cruz borrowed a line from Michael Douglas' character, President Andrew Shepherd, who does the same thing inÂ The American President.

Here are both clips for comparison:

The American PresidentÂ was written by Aaron Sorkin, whose biting dialogue made him famous in shows such asÂ The West WingÂ and films includingÂ The Social Network.

Trump, of course, was not impressed:

Lyinâ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglasâ just another dishonest politician.

Will any other candidates quote Sorkin in 2016? MaybeÂ Donald Trump could breakÂ out this line from Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake inÂ The Social Network:Â 

"A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars."
