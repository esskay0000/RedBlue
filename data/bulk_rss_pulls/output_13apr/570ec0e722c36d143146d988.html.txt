A maze of political signs for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in Charleston, South Carolina. (Reuters / Randall Hill)

I am committed to building a united front against Donald Trump, and working with both Democratic and independent voters toward the best possible ticket and platform for the Democratic Party in November. But sounding out supporters of both Sanders and Hillary Clinton, Iâm worried that terrible friction is brewing between the two Democratic camps left in this primary.

Democrats all have to unite to win the White House and Supreme Court this year, building bridges without permanent bruising or the confusion of divide-and-conquer.		
The state of the race is in flux. Respect and support for Bernie are rising, though Hillary maintains a 212-delegate edge. As of April 3, The New York Times assessed that Bernie will need âlandslideâ victories in the battles ahead. Heâs certain to win more than the 16 states where he has already prevailed. Most of those states have been similar to Wisconsin, where 88 percent of the population is white, an enduring issue for the Sanders campaign. But of the major primaries that are coming up, several might be fruitful territory for Bernie. In New York, Hillary will need to tack towards Bernie on fair-trade issues or face losses in the Rust Belt regions of northern and western New York. Here in California, Bernie trails Hillary by six points, with 7 percent of the electorate undecided. And my sense is that California is winnable for Bernie. Lose or win, Bernie represents the most impressive independent campaign in American history, with the final chapters and legacy yet to be written.		
I was an early supporter of Bernie, one of those who thought he could push Hillary to the left, legitimize democratic socialist measures, and leave an indelible mark on our frozen political culture. More deeply, I believed he was the best possible messenger in the wake of Democratic Party shortcomings. As I have argued for years, the liberal failure to create jobs in my Rust Belt heartland, Michigan, for three decades, destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives. Even after the activist explosion against free trade at the Battle of Seattle in 1999, standards of living remained stagnant. It was clear that the next generation would live lesser lives than our parents had. The tuition for a four-year public-university education almost doubled in cost between 2000 and 2015, while student debt rose to 1.2 trillion dollars in 2015. Racial disparities rose with police violence and mass incarceration rates. Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin fell to Republican governors, and Congress returned to GOP control.		
Like the WTO protests in 1999, Occupy Wall Street âchanged the conversationâ in America, as the tepid mainstream media phrased it. But we didnât need a conversation, we needed a change, and soon, in order to save a whole generation.
Most Popular1I Used to Support Bernie, but Then I Changed My Mind2Bernie Rocks Buffalo. He Also Did Something Else.3Hundreds of People Were Just Arrested Outside Congress4Sanders Is for Schmucks5We Asked 4 Prominent Bernie Supporters if Theyâd Vote for Hillary in November. Hereâs What They Told Us.
When Occupy sputtered out, Bernieâs campaign was destined to fill the void. Since winter, the two campaigns have become more visceral, even bitter, fulfilling my fear of a damaging split that could result in lower turnout among Democratic and independent voters this fall, assuming the presidential vote is close. It has become so fractious among Democrats and independents that I began to think that only Trump or Cruz could save us from ourselves. Support for Trump is dropping off now because of his slobbering racism and misogyny, while Cruz represents an even more pompous version of the same. At its core, their appeal is to working-class voters hammered out of their jobs and drawn to economic nationalism, combined with angry resentment of all the social progress achieved from the â60s until now.		
Little is predictable about this election. However, some facts still linger. Without Bernie landslides, Hillary will keep her delegate edge despite Bernieâs overall achievement. If Bernie wins New York and California, each by 1 percent, he still falls short.		
Bernieâs army will keep climbing every barricade possible. In his ideal scenario, victories in the final primaries should lead the Democratic superdelegates to shift loyalty from Hillary. Nonetheless, Bernie has received endorsements from only seven House members and none from his current Senate colleagues. No matter how much they agree with Bernie on the issues, no matter what doubts they hold about the Clintons, those running for election or reelection are unlikely to see themselves as benefiting from having a democratic socialist/independent at the top of the ticket.		
Hillary is, well, Hillary. I remember seeing her on Yaleâs green in 1969, wearing a black armband for peace while a kind of Armageddon shaped up during the Panther 21 trial and Cambodia invasion. Even then, she stood for working within the system rather than taking to the barricades. Similarly, in Chicago 1968, she observed the confrontations at a distance. If she had some sort of revolution in mind, it was evolutionary, step-by-step. In her earlier Wellesley commencement speech, she stated that the âprevailing, acquisitive, and competitive corporate life is not the way of life for us. Weâre searching for more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating modes of living.â But from there it was a determined decades-long uphill climb through those same institutions that had disenchanted the young Hillary.		
There are two Hillary Clintons. First, the early feminist, champion of childrenâs rights, and chair of the Childrenâs Defense Fund; and second, the Hillary who has grown more hawkish and prone to seeking âwin-winâ solutions with corporate America. When she seems to tack back towards her roots, it is usually in response to Bernie and new social movements. She hasnât changed as much as the Democratic Party has, responding to new and resurgent movements demanding Wall Street reform, police and prison reform, immigrant rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage, fair trade, action on climate change, LGBT rights, and more.

The peace movements from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, too, are a living legacy that fuels the public majority against sending ground troops into the fiery jaws of war another time. Bernie voted for the war in Afghanistan, but correctly faults Hillary for her hawkish impulse towards regime change. We are likely to live under a what amounts to a war presidency until either a new catastrophe or new movement leads to an alternative to the âLong Warâ on terrorism.		
The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. The path to a Canadian-type system or Medicare for All has fallen short in California and Vermont, and will require Republican defeats this year and in 2018, followed by a presidential showdown in 2020. Meanwhile, Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion are helping 20 million Americans now, mainly youth and people of color, which is a huge improvement that no thoughtful radical can dismiss as merely âreformist.â My friends at National Nurses United are to be congratulated for spending millions supporting Bernie and tirelessly rolling their buses through so many states thus far, but I donât see a rollout of a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Bernieâs position reinforces the voter impression that his idealism will be blocked in practice. Hillary and Obamaâs approach, following on her childrenâs-health-insurance law, is much easier for voters to understand and support.

Fracking will be a salient issue in both New York and California, where it has motivated and mobilized thousands of grassroots activists. The anti-fracking movement achieved a historic moratorium on fracking in New York State, where local governments had considerable leverage in a home-rule system. Big names in the entertainment business lent their prestige to the nascent movement, too. Next, the New York model headed to California, amid fracktivistsâ confidence that Governor Jerry Brown would either ban the practice or adopt a New Yorkâstyle ban. I enlisted in the anti-fracking campaign, spending many hours over these three years advocating inside and outside the Brown administration. The movement hasnât succeeded in California yet, but weâre still committed.		
The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.

The state of the race is in flux. Respect and support for Bernie are rising, though Hillary maintains a 212-delegate edge.

Most of those states have been similar to Wisconsin, where 88 percent of the population is white, an enduring issue for the Sanders campaign. But of the major primaries that are coming up, several might be fruitful territory for Bernie. In New York, Hillary will need to tack towards Bernie on fair-trade issues or face losses in the Rust Belt regions of northern and western New York. Here in California, Bernie trails Hillary by six points, with 7 percent of the electorate undecided. And my sense is that California is winnable for Bernie. Lose or win, Bernie represents the most impressive independent campaign in American history, with the final chapters and legacy yet to be written.

Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

The state of the race is in flux. Respect and support for Bernie are rising, though Hillary maintains a 212-delegate edge. As of April 3, The New York Times assessed that Bernie will need âlandslideâ victories in the battles ahead. Heâs certain to win more than the 16 states where he has already prevailed. Most of those states have been similar to Wisconsin, where 88 percent of the population is white, an enduring issue for the Sanders campaign. But of the major primaries that are coming up, several might be fruitful territory for Bernie. In New York, Hillary will need to tack towards Bernie on fair-trade issues or face losses in the Rust Belt regions of northern and western New York. Here in California, Bernie trails Hillary by six points, with 7 percent of the electorate undecided. And my sense is that California is winnable for Bernie. Lose or win, Bernie represents the most impressive independent campaign in American history, with the final chapters and legacy yet to be written.		
I was an early supporter of Bernie, one of those who thought he could push Hillary to the left, legitimize democratic socialist measures, and leave an indelible mark on our frozen political culture. More deeply, I believed he was the best possible messenger in the wake of Democratic Party shortcomings. As I have argued for years, the liberal failure to create jobs in my Rust Belt heartland, Michigan, for three decades, destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives. Even after the activist explosion against free trade at the Battle of Seattle in 1999, standards of living remained stagnant. It was clear that the next generation would live lesser lives than our parents had. The tuition for a four-year public-university education almost doubled in cost between 2000 and 2015, while student debt rose to 1.2 trillion dollars in 2015. Racial disparities rose with police violence and mass incarceration rates. Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin fell to Republican governors, and Congress returned to GOP control.		
Like the WTO protests in 1999, Occupy Wall Street âchanged the conversationâ in America, as the tepid mainstream media phrased it. But we didnât need a conversation, we needed a change, and soon, in order to save a whole generation.
Most Popular1I Used to Support Bernie, but Then I Changed My Mind2Bernie Rocks Buffalo. He Also Did Something Else.3Hundreds of People Were Just Arrested Outside Congress4Sanders Is for Schmucks5We Asked 4 Prominent Bernie Supporters if Theyâd Vote for Hillary in November. Hereâs What They Told Us.
When Occupy sputtered out, Bernieâs campaign was destined to fill the void. Since winter, the two campaigns have become more visceral, even bitter, fulfilling my fear of a damaging split that could result in lower turnout among Democratic and independent voters this fall, assuming the presidential vote is close. It has become so fractious among Democrats and independents that I began to think that only Trump or Cruz could save us from ourselves. Support for Trump is dropping off now because of his slobbering racism and misogyny, while Cruz represents an even more pompous version of the same. At its core, their appeal is to working-class voters hammered out of their jobs and drawn to economic nationalism, combined with angry resentment of all the social progress achieved from the â60s until now.		
Little is predictable about this election. However, some facts still linger. Without Bernie landslides, Hillary will keep her delegate edge despite Bernieâs overall achievement. If Bernie wins New York and California, each by 1 percent, he still falls short.		
Bernieâs army will keep climbing every barricade possible. In his ideal scenario, victories in the final primaries should lead the Democratic superdelegates to shift loyalty from Hillary. Nonetheless, Bernie has received endorsements from only seven House members and none from his current Senate colleagues. No matter how much they agree with Bernie on the issues, no matter what doubts they hold about the Clintons, those running for election or reelection are unlikely to see themselves as benefiting from having a democratic socialist/independent at the top of the ticket.		
Hillary is, well, Hillary. I remember seeing her on Yaleâs green in 1969, wearing a black armband for peace while a kind of Armageddon shaped up during the Panther 21 trial and Cambodia invasion. Even then, she stood for working within the system rather than taking to the barricades. Similarly, in Chicago 1968, she observed the confrontations at a distance. If she had some sort of revolution in mind, it was evolutionary, step-by-step. In her earlier Wellesley commencement speech, she stated that the âprevailing, acquisitive, and competitive corporate life is not the way of life for us. Weâre searching for more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating modes of living.â But from there it was a determined decades-long uphill climb through those same institutions that had disenchanted the young Hillary.		
There are two Hillary Clintons. First, the early feminist, champion of childrenâs rights, and chair of the Childrenâs Defense Fund; and second, the Hillary who has grown more hawkish and prone to seeking âwin-winâ solutions with corporate America. When she seems to tack back towards her roots, it is usually in response to Bernie and new social movements. She hasnât changed as much as the Democratic Party has, responding to new and resurgent movements demanding Wall Street reform, police and prison reform, immigrant rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage, fair trade, action on climate change, LGBT rights, and more.

The peace movements from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, too, are a living legacy that fuels the public majority against sending ground troops into the fiery jaws of war another time. Bernie voted for the war in Afghanistan, but correctly faults Hillary for her hawkish impulse towards regime change. We are likely to live under a what amounts to a war presidency until either a new catastrophe or new movement leads to an alternative to the âLong Warâ on terrorism.		
The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. The path to a Canadian-type system or Medicare for All has fallen short in California and Vermont, and will require Republican defeats this year and in 2018, followed by a presidential showdown in 2020. Meanwhile, Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion are helping 20 million Americans now, mainly youth and people of color, which is a huge improvement that no thoughtful radical can dismiss as merely âreformist.â My friends at National Nurses United are to be congratulated for spending millions supporting Bernie and tirelessly rolling their buses through so many states thus far, but I donât see a rollout of a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Bernieâs position reinforces the voter impression that his idealism will be blocked in practice. Hillary and Obamaâs approach, following on her childrenâs-health-insurance law, is much easier for voters to understand and support.

Fracking will be a salient issue in both New York and California, where it has motivated and mobilized thousands of grassroots activists. The anti-fracking movement achieved a historic moratorium on fracking in New York State, where local governments had considerable leverage in a home-rule system. Big names in the entertainment business lent their prestige to the nascent movement, too. Next, the New York model headed to California, amid fracktivistsâ confidence that Governor Jerry Brown would either ban the practice or adopt a New Yorkâstyle ban. I enlisted in the anti-fracking campaign, spending many hours over these three years advocating inside and outside the Brown administration. The movement hasnât succeeded in California yet, but weâre still committed.		
The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas.

My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

Like the WTO protests in 1999, Occupy Wall Street âchanged the conversationâ in America, as the tepid mainstream media phrased it. But we didnât need a conversation, we needed a change, and soon, in order to save a whole generation.
Most Popular1I Used to Support Bernie, but Then I Changed My Mind2Bernie Rocks Buffalo. He Also Did Something Else.3Hundreds of People Were Just Arrested Outside Congress4Sanders Is for Schmucks5We Asked 4 Prominent Bernie Supporters if Theyâd Vote for Hillary in November. Hereâs What They Told Us.
When Occupy sputtered out, Bernieâs campaign was destined to fill the void. Since winter, the two campaigns have become more visceral, even bitter, fulfilling my fear of a damaging split that could result in lower turnout among Democratic and independent voters this fall, assuming the presidential vote is close. It has become so fractious among Democrats and independents that I began to think that only Trump or Cruz could save us from ourselves. Support for Trump is dropping off now because of his slobbering racism and misogyny, while Cruz represents an even more pompous version of the same. At its core, their appeal is to working-class voters hammered out of their jobs and drawn to economic nationalism, combined with angry resentment of all the social progress achieved from the â60s until now.		
Little is predictable about this election. However, some facts still linger. Without Bernie landslides, Hillary will keep her delegate edge despite Bernieâs overall achievement. If Bernie wins New York and California, each by 1 percent, he still falls short.		
Bernieâs army will keep climbing every barricade possible. In his ideal scenario, victories in the final primaries should lead the Democratic superdelegates to shift loyalty from Hillary. Nonetheless, Bernie has received endorsements from only seven House members and none from his current Senate colleagues. No matter how much they agree with Bernie on the issues, no matter what doubts they hold about the Clintons, those running for election or reelection are unlikely to see themselves as benefiting from having a democratic socialist/independent at the top of the ticket.		
Hillary is, well, Hillary. I remember seeing her on Yaleâs green in 1969, wearing a black armband for peace while a kind of Armageddon shaped up during the Panther 21 trial and Cambodia invasion. Even then, she stood for working within the system rather than taking to the barricades. Similarly, in Chicago 1968, she observed the confrontations at a distance. If she had some sort of revolution in mind, it was evolutionary, step-by-step. In her earlier Wellesley commencement speech, she stated that the âprevailing, acquisitive, and competitive corporate life is not the way of life for us. Weâre searching for more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating modes of living.â But from there it was a determined decades-long uphill climb through those same institutions that had disenchanted the young Hillary.		
There are two Hillary Clintons. First, the early feminist, champion of childrenâs rights, and chair of the Childrenâs Defense Fund; and second, the Hillary who has grown more hawkish and prone to seeking âwin-winâ solutions with corporate America. When she seems to tack back towards her roots, it is usually in response to Bernie and new social movements. She hasnât changed as much as the Democratic Party has, responding to new and resurgent movements demanding Wall Street reform, police and prison reform, immigrant rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage, fair trade, action on climate change, LGBT rights, and more.

The peace movements from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, too, are a living legacy that fuels the public majority against sending ground troops into the fiery jaws of war another time. Bernie voted for the war in Afghanistan, but correctly faults Hillary for her hawkish impulse towards regime change. We are likely to live under a what amounts to a war presidency until either a new catastrophe or new movement leads to an alternative to the âLong Warâ on terrorism.		
The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. The path to a Canadian-type system or Medicare for All has fallen short in California and Vermont, and will require Republican defeats this year and in 2018, followed by a presidential showdown in 2020. Meanwhile, Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion are helping 20 million Americans now, mainly youth and people of color, which is a huge improvement that no thoughtful radical can dismiss as merely âreformist.â My friends at National Nurses United are to be congratulated for spending millions supporting Bernie and tirelessly rolling their buses through so many states thus far, but I donât see a rollout of a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Bernieâs position reinforces the voter impression that his idealism will be blocked in practice. Hillary and Obamaâs approach, following on her childrenâs-health-insurance law, is much easier for voters to understand and support.

Fracking will be a salient issue in both New York and California, where it has motivated and mobilized thousands of grassroots activists. The anti-fracking movement achieved a historic moratorium on fracking in New York State, where local governments had considerable leverage in a home-rule system. Big names in the entertainment business lent their prestige to the nascent movement, too. Next, the New York model headed to California, amid fracktivistsâ confidence that Governor Jerry Brown would either ban the practice or adopt a New Yorkâstyle ban. I enlisted in the anti-fracking campaign, spending many hours over these three years advocating inside and outside the Brown administration. The movement hasnât succeeded in California yet, but weâre still committed.		
The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.

We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

Little is predictable about this election. However, some facts still linger. Without Bernie landslides, Hillary will keep her delegate edge despite Bernieâs overall achievement. If Bernie wins New York and California, each by 1 percent, he still falls short.		
Bernieâs army will keep climbing every barricade possible. In his ideal scenario, victories in the final primaries should lead the Democratic superdelegates to shift loyalty from Hillary. Nonetheless, Bernie has received endorsements from only seven House members and none from his current Senate colleagues. No matter how much they agree with Bernie on the issues, no matter what doubts they hold about the Clintons, those running for election or reelection are unlikely to see themselves as benefiting from having a democratic socialist/independent at the top of the ticket.		
Hillary is, well, Hillary. I remember seeing her on Yaleâs green in 1969, wearing a black armband for peace while a kind of Armageddon shaped up during the Panther 21 trial and Cambodia invasion. Even then, she stood for working within the system rather than taking to the barricades. Similarly, in Chicago 1968, she observed the confrontations at a distance. If she had some sort of revolution in mind, it was evolutionary, step-by-step. In her earlier Wellesley commencement speech, she stated that the âprevailing, acquisitive, and competitive corporate life is not the way of life for us. Weâre searching for more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating modes of living.â But from there it was a determined decades-long uphill climb through those same institutions that had disenchanted the young Hillary.		
There are two Hillary Clintons. First, the early feminist, champion of childrenâs rights, and chair of the Childrenâs Defense Fund; and second, the Hillary who has grown more hawkish and prone to seeking âwin-winâ solutions with corporate America. When she seems to tack back towards her roots, it is usually in response to Bernie and new social movements. She hasnât changed as much as the Democratic Party has, responding to new and resurgent movements demanding Wall Street reform, police and prison reform, immigrant rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage, fair trade, action on climate change, LGBT rights, and more.

The peace movements from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, too, are a living legacy that fuels the public majority against sending ground troops into the fiery jaws of war another time. Bernie voted for the war in Afghanistan, but correctly faults Hillary for her hawkish impulse towards regime change. We are likely to live under a what amounts to a war presidency until either a new catastrophe or new movement leads to an alternative to the âLong Warâ on terrorism.		
The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. The path to a Canadian-type system or Medicare for All has fallen short in California and Vermont, and will require Republican defeats this year and in 2018, followed by a presidential showdown in 2020. Meanwhile, Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion are helping 20 million Americans now, mainly youth and people of color, which is a huge improvement that no thoughtful radical can dismiss as merely âreformist.â My friends at National Nurses United are to be congratulated for spending millions supporting Bernie and tirelessly rolling their buses through so many states thus far, but I donât see a rollout of a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Bernieâs position reinforces the voter impression that his idealism will be blocked in practice. Hillary and Obamaâs approach, following on her childrenâs-health-insurance law, is much easier for voters to understand and support.

Fracking will be a salient issue in both New York and California, where it has motivated and mobilized thousands of grassroots activists. The anti-fracking movement achieved a historic moratorium on fracking in New York State, where local governments had considerable leverage in a home-rule system. Big names in the entertainment business lent their prestige to the nascent movement, too. Next, the New York model headed to California, amid fracktivistsâ confidence that Governor Jerry Brown would either ban the practice or adopt a New Yorkâstyle ban. I enlisted in the anti-fracking campaign, spending many hours over these three years advocating inside and outside the Brown administration. The movement hasnât succeeded in California yet, but weâre still committed.		
The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon.

The path to a Canadian-type system or Medicare for All has fallen short in California and Vermont, and will require Republican defeats this year and in 2018, followed by a presidential showdown in 2020. Meanwhile, Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion are helping 20 million Americans now, mainly youth and people of color, which is a huge improvement that no thoughtful radical can dismiss as merely âreformist.â My friends at National Nurses United are to be congratulated for spending millions supporting Bernie and tirelessly rolling their buses through so many states thus far, but I donât see a rollout of a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Bernieâs position reinforces the voter impression that his idealism will be blocked in practice. Hillary and Obamaâs approach, following on her childrenâs-health-insurance law, is much easier for voters to understand and support.

Fracking will be a salient issue in both New York and California, where it has motivated and mobilized thousands of grassroots activists. The anti-fracking movement achieved a historic moratorium on fracking in New York State, where local governments had considerable leverage in a home-rule system. Big names in the entertainment business lent their prestige to the nascent movement, too. Next, the New York model headed to California, amid fracktivistsâ confidence that Governor Jerry Brown would either ban the practice or adopt a New Yorkâstyle ban. I enlisted in the anti-fracking campaign, spending many hours over these three years advocating inside and outside the Brown administration. The movement hasnât succeeded in California yet, but weâre still committed.		
The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

There are two Hillary Clintons. First, the early feminist, champion of childrenâs rights, and chair of the Childrenâs Defense Fund; and second, the Hillary who has grown more hawkish and prone to seeking âwin-winâ solutions with corporate America. When she seems to tack back towards her roots, it is usually in response to Bernie and new social movements. She hasnât changed as much as the Democratic Party has, responding to new and resurgent movements demanding Wall Street reform, police and prison reform, immigrant rights and a $15-an-hour minimum wage, fair trade, action on climate change, LGBT rights, and more.

The peace movements from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, too, are a living legacy that fuels the public majority against sending ground troops into the fiery jaws of war another time. Bernie voted for the war in Afghanistan, but correctly faults Hillary for her hawkish impulse towards regime change. We are likely to live under a what amounts to a war presidency until either a new catastrophe or new movement leads to an alternative to the âLong Warâ on terrorism.		
The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic.

Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. The path to a Canadian-type system or Medicare for All has fallen short in California and Vermont, and will require Republican defeats this year and in 2018, followed by a presidential showdown in 2020. Meanwhile, Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion are helping 20 million Americans now, mainly youth and people of color, which is a huge improvement that no thoughtful radical can dismiss as merely âreformist.â My friends at National Nurses United are to be congratulated for spending millions supporting Bernie and tirelessly rolling their buses through so many states thus far, but I donât see a rollout of a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Bernieâs position reinforces the voter impression that his idealism will be blocked in practice. Hillary and Obamaâs approach, following on her childrenâs-health-insurance law, is much easier for voters to understand and support.

Fracking will be a salient issue in both New York and California, where it has motivated and mobilized thousands of grassroots activists. The anti-fracking movement achieved a historic moratorium on fracking in New York State, where local governments had considerable leverage in a home-rule system. Big names in the entertainment business lent their prestige to the nascent movement, too. Next, the New York model headed to California, amid fracktivistsâ confidence that Governor Jerry Brown would either ban the practice or adopt a New Yorkâstyle ban. I enlisted in the anti-fracking campaign, spending many hours over these three years advocating inside and outside the Brown administration. The movement hasnât succeeded in California yet, but weâre still committed.		
The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.

Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

The arguments among environmentalists are the deepest and most frustrating of any Iâve seen for 40 yearsâbut theyâre important to understand. Along the way, there have been historic achievements. Our environmental-justice movement, with the leadership of state Senator Kevin De LeÃ³n, wrote into law a requirement that 25 percent of billions in Californiaâs cap-and-trade dollars would go to benefit disadvantaged communities, such as the Central Valley and South Central LA, many of which are predominantly of color. Nearly $300 million began pouring into such communities on a yearly basis. California is spending $120 billion over four years on clean energy, the largest such investment in the country. We also passed the first divestment-from-coal bill in history. Under Brownâs leadership, California created a Global Green Bloc of states and regions, from Canada to China to Europe and Latin America, building a zero-emissions or low-emissions economic powerhouse. A 2014 reportÂ found that there are 200,000 clean-energy jobs in the state, surpassing jobs in the fossil-fuels industry.

But the fracking debate continues to leave permanent scars. Despite the governorâs historically high approval ratings, the fracktivists take every media opportunity to thrash him personally. They rack up names on online petitions, but so far have failed to gain political traction. Their apocalyptic view has only worsened. In addition to personally attacking Brown, whose approval rating is 56 percent, they have brutally attacked NRDC and âestablishmentâ environmentalists for not achieving a moratorium in California. Their tactics build their online membership, but turn off or confuse more mainstream Californians.		
The Democratic primary may deepen this antagonism and result in defections among Hillary supporters. Hillary wants limits on fracking: a ban where individual states have blocked it, like in New York; safeguards against childrenâs and family exposures; a ban where releases of methane or contamination of ground water are proven; and full disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. Bernieâs position is that heâs simply against all fracking.		
But Hillaryâs position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she âhas pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate planâ and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years. If and when Obamaâs Clean Power Plan is upheld in the federal courts, now a likelihood after Justice Scaliaâs death, that will bring a even greater change.		
Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term. Instead, Bernie will call his own summit of experts in the first hundred days he is president. There is no recognition of the overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress, which can only be broken on state-by-state organizing. The climate clock is ticking towards doomsday. Where are we moving next, beyond waiting for the overthrow of Citizens United?		
For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030. Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground.

Emissions of invisible particulate matter are an immediate threat to the lives and safety of millions of California workers, children, and residents of inner and rural towns. The Lara bill is an issue both candidates could immediately unite immediately around.

My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless. And my third concern: Bernie is leading an incredible movement and sowing seeds for the future, but lacks a concrete plan for turning his legacy into a permanent progressive force. We donât know what will happen to the army of supporters he has assembled, but we already know the pattern of many similar projectsâwhich end up going into decline or divisions.		
Voting on June 7 is a personal responsibility for myself and other Californians, just as it is for my friends and colleagues in New York on April 19. What is to be done in this agonizing situation? I still believe a united front against the Republicans is the best and most necessary strategy. But I canât vote for a united front on June 7.		
I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. In the environmental movement I start from the premise of environmental justice for the poor and communities of color. My wife is a descendant of the Oglala Sioux, and my whole family is inter-racial.		
What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust. And I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president. When I understood that the overwhelming consensus from those communities was for Hillaryâfor instance the Congressional Black Caucus and Sacramentoâs Latino caucusâthat was the decisive factor for me. I am gratified with Bernieâs increasing support from these communities of color, though it has appeared to be too little and too late. Bernieâs campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.		
Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor. My intellectual hero is C. Wright Mills, a Marxist who broke with what he condemned as the stale âlabor metaphysicâ of the communist and socialist parties, embracing instead an international New Left led by young middle-class students around the world. Mills was fresh, honest, and always searching. The 1962 Port Huron Statement declared that we needed liberals for their relevance in achieving reforms, and socialists for their deeper critique of underlying systems. We did not declare ourselves for socialism but for a massive expansion of the New Deal, combined with an attack on the Cold War arms race. We called for a basic realignment of the Democratic Party through the force of social movements, but not through a third party. We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.		
		

For some, like myself (who suffered a serious stroke while investigating fracking sumps in San Joaquin County last year), the question couldnât be more urgent. I am fully supporting state Senator Ricardo Laraâs legislation setting firm timelines for the phasing out of asthma and cancer-causing emissions of black carbon, methane, and f-gases as an emergency health measure. The bill includes three key deadlinesâ40 percent methane reductions, 40 percent of hydrofluorocarbon gases, and 50 percent cuts in black-carbon emissionsâall by 2030.

We even went âpart of the way with LBJâ in the face of the 1964 Goldwater threat. From there the Democrats divided over race and Vietnam, eventually leading to Nixon. Even in the â80s and â9os, our campaign for âeconomic democracyâ chose not to identify as a socialist movement. With the coming of the 2008 Wall Street crash and Bernieâs campaign, our political culture has changed profoundly in its tolerance of socialist ideas. But is it enough after this truly divisive primary season?		
I wish our primary could focus more on ending wars and ending regime change too, issues where Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk. Both Bernie and Hillary call for âdestroyingâ ISIS, whatever that might meanâbut it certainly means we are moving into yet another âwar presidency.â At least there is strong bipartisan opposition to the open-ended deployment of troops on the ground. But Hillaryâs penchant for intervention and regime change can only be thwarted by enough progressive Democrats in Congress and massive protests in the streets and online. Neither candidate so far is calling for the creation of a new peace movement, but thatâs the only way to check the drift into another war.		
So here we are, at the end of one generation on the left and the rise of another. Both camps in the party will need each other in Novemberâmore than either side needs to emerge triumphant in the primary. We still need the organizing of a united front of equals to prevail against the Republicans. It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives. Itâs up to all of us.

I am beyond disappointed that the Nation would actually print this garbage.  It&apos;s this kind of BS that is DIVIDING the party.  Do you really think that the southern states that Hillary won in the primaries will go blue in November?  Do you really think that Elizabeth Warren and other uncommitted delegates aren&apos;t going to go with Bernie at the convention?  Were you paying attention in 2008?  I could go on, but many others have expressed what&apos;s on my mind.

Tom: Bernie hasn&apos;t had "all the money in the world" for 18 months.  He announced less than a year ago.  He initially targeted those places where he knew he may be able to build momentum against a powerful, moneyed machine - the DNC - as well the as vast resources of HRC.  And while the leadership of some of the communities to which you allude have endorsed HRC, I believe it is becoming more evident that Democrats may no longer count on the disenfranchised for their vote.  I realize you have served as a Democrat, but I ask that you hold off on casting your primary vote.  Many of us out here, like you "back in the day," are working our tails off not only for Bernie, but in support of a political revolution, waged on many fronts, that is long overdue.  Compromise or capitulation as this phase doesn&apos;t seem like an option.

Very sad!!!!!

Somebody else probably said this already, somewhere down there in the comment pile, but I&apos;ll say it again: Tom Hayden, you used to be a revolutionary, somewhere down there in your personal history.

I used to respect Tom Hayden, but now I changed my mind.

I&apos;m not an American but all the political conflict makes me despair for the survival of humanity. We really don&apos;t have time to fight.  http://thelastwhy.ca/poems/2015/6/25/life-a-reaction-to-the-void

When I read declarations like Haydenâs, I am reminded of what historian Barbara Jeanne Fields once wrote about race: âIf race lives on today, it does not live on because we have inherited it from our forebearsâ¦but because we continue to create it today.â And we will âcontinue toâ create it and recreate it, Fields predicts, âso long as the most radical goal of the political opposition remains the reallocation of unemployment, poverty and injustice rather than their abolition.â

Whenever âthe black voteâ/âthe minority vote,â âraceâ and/or âracismâ get evoked in these endless debates about Clinton versus Sanders, the question of what it will take to abolish unemployment, poverty and injustice barely (if ever) arises, nor does the question of which candidatesâ platform takes us in that direction. Instead, the terms simply serve the purpose of recreating race in order to set limits on what is politically possible.

Hayden offers ârace,â his Oglala Sioux wife, the âcauses of African Americans, the Chicano movement,â the support of the CBC and Latino caucuses, etc., as if these are all explanation enough of his decision to vote for Hilary. Not once does Hayden even venture to demonstrate how he believes HRCâs policies address the particular needs of these communities (which, I assume, include the abolition of unemployment, poverty and injustice). Indeed, Hayden apparently feels that race makes his decision self-evident, and that HRC â unlike Sanders â aligns completely with the meaning that he gives to race, i.e., the Sioux-ness of his wife, the Blackness of the CBC, the Latino-ness of the Latino caucuses. Whatever that meaning is, however, it surely does not challenge the status quo.

We can see the same kind of recreation of race in many of the comments to Haydenâs article âwhether made in support of HRC or Sanders. And in all of them we see just how far we are from pursuing the radical goal of abolishing unemployment, poverty and injustice.

My problem with this article, you are not a former Bernie supporter.  You&apos;ve been supporting her run for president since 2012 Mr Hayden.   http://tomhayden.com/home/hillary-clinton-in-2016.html

There are a number of problems with the logic in this article, such as: 
1) Needing a "landslide" victory -- this "math favors Hillary" narrative is based on the assumption that she will maintain all of her super delegates, despite the fact super delegates have never swayed the nomination. When you take super delegates out of the picture, Bernie has 45% of pledged delegates, so he only needs about 57% of the rest of the pledged delegates to win, which is hardly a landslide. I&apos;m also suspect of using an NYT "assessment" as a credible media source, given their endorsement of Hillary and overall for-profit bias as a news organization in general. 
2) The supposed "early feminist, champion of children&apos;s right" side of Hillary: during the 2008 election, the Children&apos;s Defense Fund did not endorse Hillary and said, and the CDF president in a 2007 Democracy Now! interview said "Hillary Clinton is an old friend, but they are not friends in politics," largely because of her support and active campaigning for the PRWORA, which did more to harm the welfare state than any other piece of legislation, including those from the Reagan/Bush era. I&apos;m a social work grad student right now, and I can say about 90% of people are either pro-Bernie or not voting at all, in part because of her support for PRWORA and mass incarceration. More info on that here: http://www.salon.com/2015/10/15/the_worst_thing_hillary_clinton_has_ever_done/
3) "Bernie&apos;s ideas will be blocked in practice" -- yes, and so will Hillary&apos;s if we have a Republican controlled Congress. But given that voter turnout is largely what determines political outcomes, and that turnout for Bernie has consistently resulted in him over performing in polls (like in Michigan, my home state as well), Bernie is likely the best shot at having a Democratic White House and Congress. Increasing voter turnout for Democratic control is, explicitly, what Bernie has defined as the "political revolution," not this nebulous idea that many are making it out to be. 
4) "Race is the reason I&apos;m supporting Hillary" - Yes, the "black vote" tends to favor Hillary (though, not as overwhelmingly as some make it seem -- it was 30/70 in Michigan, Wisconsin, and less skewed in other States), and Latinos tend to vote for Hillary (though there are, again, exception like "winning" the Latino vote in Nevada). However, Hawaii is the least white State in the US, and Bernie has done better with Native Americans, Arab Americans, and other populations, when those data are even available. These exception aside, votes aren&apos;t necessarily representative of what an large, heterogenous community of people feel -- BLM activist, Bell Hooks, Angela Davis, and others have made a point of not endorsing either candidate since both candidates have either problematic or colorblind policies in the past or present.  More importantly, if you&apos;ve been fighting for struggles for people of color for such a long time, how do you reconcile Hillary&apos;s support and active campaigning for welfare "reform" (which disproportionately affected people of color, especially single mothers, in particular) and the mass incarceration of Black people (this is a genuine question, not a rhetorical one)? I understand that these were Bill Clinton&apos;s policies, but she had an active role in supporting them at the time, and championed them during her 2008 presidential campaign.

Let&apos;s see:  Just in the last week or so, we have Hillary laughing and winking at De Blasio&apos;s Colored People Time joke and making her own joke about Ghandi running a gas station in MO, and Bill lecturing and yelling at Black Lives Matter protesters, basically accusing them of being ignorant.  Looks like we have a pattern developing here.

This piece is fraught with worry - worry that Bernie will simply "reject Obamacare," worry that Bernie&apos;s principled position on fracking is unachievable, worry that Bernie hasn&apos;t faced the Republican attack machine yet, and worry that Bernie is not favored by minority communities. Remember what the greatest American Democratic socialist of the 20th century said: "The only thing to fear is fear itself." It seems that the author is living in a state of fear. I have made a decision not to base my choice in this election on fear, but rather on a belief that we can do better than choosing "safe" incremental establishment Democratic politics and policies. The truth is that Bernie has no intention of rejecting Obamacare, as he has stated on many occasions; his plan is to lay the groundwork for achieving Medicare for all, the final results of which may not even be achieved during his presidency, but eventually. He starts from a position of no fracking at all, rather the safe middle of the road approach Hillary has chosen, ultimately because she is beholden to the oil and gas industries. As Bernie introduces himself to minorities communities, his approval numbers increase. He has already made huge headway in Latino communities around the country. Sure, unlike "Clinton," his was not a household name when his campaign began, but as the days go by, his trajectory remains upward. Clinton would like for this to be over before that continues much further.

It was horrible living with 8 years of George W Busch. I can&apos;t stand the idea of 8 years
with HRC as President. Thank God,, I have the chose  of voting , for Green Party
Candidate, Jill Stein.

So, after all your ponderous pontificating on the "issues", it comes down to your self-serving interests? It all comes back to YOU? Really, you should be embarrassed...You should just be straight with us, and say, "I want to continue in the political establishment, even if it is taking us all down into flames, and having Bernie as president might jeopardize me. So I am supporting Hillary." At least you would be following millions of other Americans who are honestly putting their petty, narrow concerns above the nation as a whole.

If, in the later years of our lives we won&apos;t stand on principle, when will we? I stand with Bernie, not the corporate elites.

So the "decisive factor" in voting for Hillary is that other people are voting for her?

Hillary Clinton has never met a Pyrrhic victory she didn&apos;t like.  Her policies of timid incrementalism have given us what we have today.  It seems to me those increments have shrunk to microns.  Her response to any new idea: that&apos;s too hard, why rock the boat.  
I agree, the numbers for Bernie Sanders are daunting.  At this point, though, neither candidate can make it a clean win, they both need the dirty supers to make the number.  
Any spending legislation must originate in the House of Representatives.  The question then becomes not just who is at the top of the ticket but who is at the bottom as well.  I do not expect either Clinton or Trump to have long coat tails, this would make either of their agendas more difficult to implement.  Sanders and Cruz may have more potential to elevate down ticket elections; between those two you have the choice of a stable government or an oligarchy in priestly robes.
It&apos;s going to be a long slog to November.

I have a problem with "Sanders" and "Cruz" in the same sentence.

I was surprised that some comment contributors were complaining that this article was published--and want it removed!!??  I have noticed that the most stirring articles achieve that status due to thought provoking comments, not the actual thesis of the article.  I confess that I was thinking along the lines Tom had outlined, but after reading the comments I&apos;m back to supporting Bernie.  Only Bernie will be able to motivate the millennials--in whom we must trust to propel major change in our broken political system for years to come.

Great point, censorship always sucks, even if it seems to be on "your side".

Dear The Nation, Please pull this lying pile of crap off your website. This clown has NEVER been a Bernie supporter as his own website proves. It&apos;s obvious, therefore, why he dead wrong about so many of Bernie&apos;s policies and the notions of Bernie&apos;s supporters. Take it down ASAP. Thank you, a disgruntled subscriber.

Jill, if you disagree with the author of this article, then speak your mind. Tell him why he&apos;s wrong about Bernie&apos;s supporters and policies. But calling for The Nation to silence his point of view...? No. Never. You should feel ashamed for making the request.

You say, "Meanwhile, Bernieâs total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed."
Not so. This is so easy. Fracking can only exist because of special exemptions from EPA regulation. Remove the "Halliburton loophole" from the Clean Water Act, and all fracking is illegal tomorrow.  http://cleanwater.org/page/fracking-laws-and-loopholes
It&apos;s so obvious that he probably doesn&apos;t feel the need to say it. Remove the loopholes and enforce the laws and fracking is gone. Simple as that. 
"Hillary is, well, Hillary."
She sure is.  
"All told, the campaign to elect Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 has received more than $4.5 million from lobbyists, bundlers, and large donors connected the fossil fuel industry." 
http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaign-updates/hillary-clintons-connection-oil-gas-industry/

Again, dead simple. Choices that couldn&apos;t be more obvious.
If you want to vote for a woman, vote for Jill Stein. She doesn&apos;t take money from the fracking industry that harmed you so badly. She&apos;d make a great President, too. I voted for her in 2012, and I hope that Sanders gives her a cabinet position. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a radical ask from Sanders. 
That&apos;s a never ask from Clinton. 

Simple choices. Easy.

Tom, this is how corrupt Hillary Clinton is:
"According to public disclosures, by giving just 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, Clinton made $2,935,000 from 2013 to 2015."
]snip]
"during Hillary Clintonâs time as secretary of state, Bill Clinton earned $17 million in talks to banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, real estate businesses, and other financial firms. Altogether, the couple are estimated to have made over $139 million from paid speeches."

And you think she&apos;d be a better president than Bernie Sanders. You are as corrupt as she is except that your price is lower.

He doesn&apos;t care. Turns out he&apos;s (turn your sensitive eyes, Joan Walsh) a Vagina Voter. http://tomhayden.com/home/hillary-clinton-in-2016.html "The choice between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2008 was difficult for many Democrats. Clinton in 2016 should not be. What is at stake is another chance to make history by electing a woman president ..."

The democratic party would not be "split" if Bernie were treated fairly, there were no patronizing super delegates, no DLC, and there was not an obscene preference from day one from the party elite.  It is not the people who split the party.  It was the self-appointed party elites and their corporate media that tried to steal the democratic process from the people.  It is they who split the party.

In politics anything can happen.  That&apos;s where the seasoned political analysts get blown away by "strategy" instead of listening to the suffering masses, and simply do the right thing.

His arguments are the same as most others -and on the superficial face of it, they are reasonable. Sanders cannot get his agenda passed. He will get slaughtered by the Republican&apos;s dirty tricks squad in a general election. And that without rational rhyme or reason, he believes her to be "better on race". ..in spite of winning the most diversified state n the Union, Hawaii, having a better record than Hillary, and having policies that will benefit lower income groups far better than Hillary&apos;s. The bottom line is that he appears to have lost his courage. No disrespect meant. We all lose our courage.

I was in Chicago in 1968. This year is an eerie reminder. Having read many of the comments, I see no point in my piling on. However, I must say that you, Tom Hayden, will never rise to level of exciting the masses that Abbie Hoffman could. Yea, I stole the book.

Embarrassing!  Does Hayden not realize that he&apos;s factually in massive error?  The Congressional Black Caucus did NOT support Hillary.  It was the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, political action committee.   The PAC&apos;s membership contains only 8 of the 46 actual CBC members.  The majority of its board is made up of lobbyists representing various corporate interests.

You&apos;d think an old radical like Hayden would understand the distinction.

Shame on you, Tom Hayden.  If you wanted to write this why not wait until AFTER the California primary?

He is just another Hillary shill.  Sometimes I wish people like him would just sit down and shut up.  Let history take its course.

He&apos;s as bad as the right-wing denigrators who continue to claim Bernie has "no chance".  But unfortunately Hayden&apos;s history makes his words more powerful, even if no more prophetic.

If you&apos;re gonna write a hit piece at least get your facts in order.

As I read your piece Tom, I sit in front of my screen and to the right of me on the wall is a picture of you.  There are also the other 6 members of the "Chicago Eight" from the Avedon print.  You used to be a hero of mine(past tense).  We have all gotten older but many of us have also held fast to the lessons of our youth.  The corporations will never convince me they are better than the people.  The Dark Side does not hold the answer.

Hillary is fighting for her political life. Bernie is fighting for a decent society. I have been waiting for someone like him to come along for more than four decades. Hillary is a sneak and a hypocrite and anyone who uses a white noise machine so that the press could not hear what she said to the fat cats will not get my vote. Period.

I&apos;m ashamed The Nation ran this. This fool was never actually a Bernie supporter. He admits it up front. He only "supported" Bernie insofar as he could push Hillary to the left. This is nothing more than a Hillary ad disguised as a balanced and thoughtful critique. My god he even gets basic facts appallingly wrong. For instance, when he says, "[T]o simply reject Obamacare in the belief that &apos;political revolution&apos; will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic." Well yeah, BUT NO ONE ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT. I mean, that is without doubt one of the weakest straw men I&apos;ve literally ever seen. Shame on the writer for knowingly putting millions of lives at risk for the sake of political expediency. And shame on The Nation for publishing this tripe.

I was about to really ... just ...  actually, really in factually ... but I was reading the other comments first, and I ran across Mark Cook&apos;s -- "Yes, this thing is so flimsy, so poorly argued, that it makes one think of a hostage video."  I laughed, and that, laughably, is all I care to add.

Bernie polls MUCH BETTER against Trump and ALL REPUBLICAN Candidates!  If you want a democratic win then voting for Hillary is your WORST CHOICE as you will almost CERTAINLY wind up with a REPUBLICAN President.  If you really want to keep TRUMP out, your best bet BY FAR is BERNIE.  He will get people out to the polls to vote, and in huge numbers.  HRC does not motivate people--she is seen as the lesser of two evils. A choice made out of lack of choice--but we have an actual choice that is much better for the country--and the ONLY WAY TO GET MONEY OUT OF POLTIICS--BERNIE walks the walk and will fight for change.

Not only that, but the argument that Bernie is a high-risk candidate and his superior poll numbers are meaningless because he has not yet been exposed to the broadsides of a general election campaign is not just a lame HRC talking point but just about one of the most fatuous arguments I have ever heard or read.  For starters, the same pretty much could be said of every new general election candidate the Democratic Party has fielded in the past 60 years or more.  Secondly, Hillary has never faced a full on general election all out warfare presidential campaign either, and there is a whole lot more ammunition to use against Hillary than against Bernie.  Why Tom wants to hand the Republicans the keys to a massive general election arsenal is beyond me.  The high risk candidate obviously is Hillary.

Facts are misstated.  Sanders did not have plenty of money 18 months ago to invest in inner city organizing.  The money for the first 14 months was just keeping up with the campaign.   And their are plenty of American Indians who are working to save mother Earth and so support Sanders.  

That part of Hayden&apos;s argument is a weak.

Republicans would obstruct Hillary as much as Bernie.  Why wouldn&apos;t they?
The crux of the matter is Hillary is a confirmed neoliberal/neoconservative.  that means everything, all over the world, is done for profit motive. And if you don&apos;t like it, you&apos;ll meet up with our $700 billion dollar military.   This is leading to outrageous and ever-growing wealth inequality,  which creates a demand (consumption) shortage, as 99% don&apos;t have money to buy things like they used to.  This affects minorities a lot, since most are in the 99%.   
Is it patronizing for Hayden to vote based on race?  Or is it more patronizing for me to suggest that the great majority of minority voters still don&apos;t get that Obama has been working for Wall St for 7 years, and Hils would do the same?  And why is there nothing said about how Hillary compiled her voter lead using the black vote in Deep Red states she can&apos;t possibly win in NOV?

Republicans will obstruct Hillary more than Bernie, except on warmongering and Dodd-Frank rollbacks and weakening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Bernie has a long track record of forging common ground with Republicans; Hillary has none.  Bernie is liked; Hillary is hated.

Hillary has no record of  working with REPUBs?  What about Iraq War, Libya, neoliberal austerity economics, suckin&apos; up to Wall St- she has all the classic REPUB moves, just like Obama!  Sanders has a history with REPUBs?  Maybe on some military spending and gun issues, but DEMs love military spending as much as REPUBs.

It&apos;s not time to vote for Hillary Clinton . . . yet.  Senator Sanders has brought the progressive platform a long, long way from the Nader campaign.  Our planks are resonating more than ever, and the trend is encouraging.  This is a time for the movement to see its scale, and to let the country see it.   Half of us are going to hold our noses and vote for the nominated candidate and pray for the occasional pleasant surprise during their presidency.  But the progressive movement must continue to refine its vision and explain its benefits to the American people, laying the ground work for, more importantly I think, a better Congress.  Senator Sanders has done this like no other, and that effort deserves our vote in the primaries.

Please note the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) did NOT endorse Clinton, the CBC PAC (a separate entity, whose 20-member board includes 11 lobbyists) did. A member of the actual CBC, Congress member Keith Ellison, tweeted &apos;The point [is] that endorsements should be the product of a fair open process. Didnât happen. See: https://theintercept.com/2016/02/11/congressional-black-caucus-hillary/

Isn&apos;t this a pretty good example of EXACTLY the type of corrupting influence of corporations on political process that we should be fighting against, not using as an example of &apos;Clinton&apos;s strong ties to the African American community&apos;?

Truely.  How tone deaf and uninformed can Tom Hayden get?

Maybe it&apos;s a generational thing: boomers vs. millennials.
I couldnât help but really like Bernie, and I still do,
just as I really liked Don Quixote, Man of La Mancha:
âTo dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march into Hell
For a heavenly cause
And I know if I&apos;ll only be true 
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I&apos;m laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable starâ

"The brighter the light, the darker the shadow."
Do we really want an idealist in the White House?
And then there is Hilary, I mean Sancho Panza,
the down-to-earth pragmatist, realist, side-kick.
Maybe it is a generational thing; I&apos;m a pre-boomer.

This disingenuous crap assumes that Bernie has proposed no way to get the dream, e.g. tax stock transactions to pay for free public college tuition and have money left over. It also assumes that pragmatism = doing what big donors demand.  Hillary fell off her burro a long time ago.

I&apos;m a boomer.  No, it is not a generational thing except to the extent the the 60s generation has copped out or been co-opted (or the portion on the margins throughout).  I read ï»¿ Don Quixote, Man of La Mancha in high school and found it a wonderful book.  Of course, we analyzed it from all different angles but I always understood that "tilting at windmills" is not always futile.  "Impossible Dream" and "Born Free" have been my favorite songs from my youth.  Finally, Hillary definitively is not Sancho Panza.  Sancho Panza is above all loyal and the servant of his idealistic master; Hillary insists on being master, with neither principle nor ideal (Hayden even almost admits this), and will stab anyone in the back the moment they fail to serve her ends.

It shouldn&apos;t be a generational thing, but older folks still associate "socialism" with the Soviet Union and Stalin! Just ask the typical 72-yr old Fox News junkie.
Here is the real difference between Sanders and H. Clinton- Sanders would preserve capitalism with an expanded effort to smooth out its boom/ bust cycles to slightly ameliorate the misery of the 99%, and Hils would preserve capitalism with the goal of making sure that Wall St profits from the catastrophes it creates (the Obama model).

Democratic socialism runs deeply through the fabric of American life and government, notwithstanding red-baiting and the now anachronistic Cold War.  It is easy to construct a positive ad campaign that shows that Bernie is in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Henry Wallace, Harry Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, and LBJ, not to mention Jimmy Carter.  Even Nixon, when you get away from the Imperial Presidency and the racist Southern Strategy, was a democratic socialist (e.g. Earned Income Credit).  Any attempt to tar Bernie with his admiration of Eugene Debs will end up only finally educating the American people regarding the true greatness of Mr. Debs and the huge injustices done him.  We can even bring Clarence Darrow into the commentary.

I&apos;m one of those "older folk." Socialism inspires me and I&apos;m for Bernie.

I congratulate you, but the data shows older folks are Hillary folks.   Bernie and Progressivism  are being held back by seniors and minorities,  that&apos;s the way it is right now!  And yeah, it&apos;s damn frustrating , and it does call into question whether American minorities actually want change, or just like to hear certain people talk about Incremental Establishmentarianism.

Pragmatic for who?

Why not try and "make the best of all possible worlds" by encouraging and supporting a Bernie/Hillary or Hillary/Bernie  ticket? I know, I was already accused of being sweet and simple for suggesting it -- politics is war after all -- but really if what we need to do is to save the shreds of real democracy (and the faint shadows of  the "four freedoms" of FDR) left in our country we damn well better beat whoever the Republicans come up with and win the House & Senate as well!  The DNC is hopelessly clueless as to where we really are as a country (or is too busy making money for itself) to pay attention to what must be done. And it ain&apos;t what has always been done -- walk the chalk line that goes down the middle, stay away from big ideas, value easy steps over necessary ones (and tiny steps over big ones) and don&apos;t piss off anyone. No one is going to accomplish anything if we tiptoe around the necessary in order to embrace a little bit of the possible. If Hillary and Bernie really want to do what is best for a country drowning in a war of meaningless words,  in the midst of chaos,  close to the edge of disaster, they need to recognize that they need each other and start planning  together how they can be most effective at making change happen.  This is my challenge to both of them!

No way with either of them have the other on their ticket.  Bernie would go wonderful with Elizabeth Warren.  Hillary might pick Mitt Romney!  (Just kidding, but not too much!)

No.  Warren is too much like Bernie; it would be a Bernie-Bernie ticket.  Besides, Warren will be much more valuable and effective staying in the Senate than as VP.  We need Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner for Veep.

Given Trump&apos;s self-described ability to "make myself be whatever I want to be," the self-righteous side of Bernie and the cultishness of at least some of his acolytes, I see a Trump-Bernie ticket as more likely than a Hill-Bern pairing.  Bog help us then!

Hillary IS the DNC!  She and Bill used the White House to turn the DEM Party into the CorpaDem Party, with a controlling interest by Clinton, Inc.   DNC Chair Debbie  Wasserman Schultz is Hillary&apos;s former national campaign manager, no conflict of interest there!  After months of outrage over the debate schedule, Debbie W still tried to schedule a debate during the NCAA basketball championship game.  Why not?  Does Obama ever hold anyone accountable for anything?

The odds of Hillary choosing Bernie for VP are zero.

How about Bernie choosing Hillary for VP.  Who do you think Hillary would choose if she is so lucky?

Totally lame, Tom. Pathetic that you&apos;re selling out after all these years. Hillary is Republican lite, and her foreign policy views have been described as terrifying. No way she&apos;ll get my vote, dude!

Tom Hayden, shame on you! You threw out your important contributions to "the power of the people" while writing this. You bring up many principled concerns about war and peace, fracking, a clean environment, and then you collude with the capitalists darling by suggesting that Hillary is any where near as good for us as Bernie Sanders. 
Here is the thing, IF you vote for Bernie Sanders, you will be voting for a united coalition. Most of of her supporters will vote for him in November, but not the other way around. I recommend a rethinking on this, and another article that apologizes for this one.

This guy is horrible

Sounds amazingly like what Hillary and establishment elites say all the time about Sanders.

This was an interesting read, but I think such an important point has been missed by this focus on race. I think its around 3 million black voters we&apos;ve wiped from the electorate with mass incarceration and felony restrictions, and the disenfranchised are not the more affluent middle aged women who tend toward the status quo. We&apos;ve disenfranchised millions of young inner city men, who are much more likely to support radical change. If we want to play identity politics, it has to be much more sophisticated than handing Hillary &apos;the black vote.&apos; If  &apos;Bernie Bros&apos; were disenfranchised like &apos;super predators&apos; were, Hillary&apos;s support among black voters and white voters would be much more comparable. 

Undoubtedly, race is an important tool for understanding collective interests, but I think we let it blind us. I read an otherwise well thought out article on Hillary&apos;s appeal to black voters, that provided the black electorate as more religious and less inclined to radical politics and then wrapped this thought up neatly and handed it to Hillary as a black endorsement. Black political movements have been so &apos;radical&apos; that the FBI dismantled them, targeting black leaders for assassination and imprisonment. We can&apos;t look at voting data as some type of black truth without recognising how white people have suppressed and engineered the black electorate according to the desires of the political  establishment. 

There&apos;s a dark side to Hillary&apos;s high levels of black support, and it isn&apos;t told through employment statistics, or voting data, or opinion polls, and certainly not through lists of financial donors - millions have been excluded from these metrics. Until the black electorate is as representative as the white electorate, voting according to black polling data is little more than rubber-stamping an establishment that silences any black voice it doesn&apos;t want to hear. That is, unfortunately, my perception of the Clinton&apos;s relationship with &apos;the black vote&apos;. Bernie may not get as many black votes, but I believe he has a humanity that allows him to work for people who have no vote - while Hillary plays identity politics like a cynical game.

I hear that the Vatican invited Bernie because they couldn&apos;t afford Hillary&apos;s speaking fees.
ï»¿ I liked Tom Hayden in the 1960s, but Then I Changed My Mind.

Ha! That&apos;s hilarious. I&apos;d follow you on Twitter if I could figure out which Bob Laughton is you!

Best comment yet! Thanks for the laugh.

Tom, you&apos;ve been one of my heroes for a long time, but you&apos;ve turned into fuzzy here. What you&apos;ve said provides all the reasons for supporting  Bernie, but I&apos;m still looking in your piece for that Hillary edge that would make me want to change. If you&apos;re looking for ONE reason not to support Hillary it&apos;s the anything-but-subtle hawk we all know about that sends thousands of Black and Latino kids in disproportionate numbers back home in coffins.

Nicely said. Even though he&apos;s arguing in favor of voting for Hillary, the piece probably has more evidence in it to vote for Bernie than not.

What bothers me most about the defeatism of Clinton supporters is the failure to view our entire political system for what it is â a human construct, entirely within the people&apos;s control to reform, teardown and rebuild. 

Our system has been deemed an Oligarchy, the way we finance elections is morally bankrupt, conservative estimates say our moral exceptionalist approach to "defense" (Imperialism) is responsible for the killing of 20-30 million people since the end of World War II. You may be comfortable enough to wait out the baby steps of establishment-led progress .... you might be happy with crumbs. But a recent study shows the working poor can no longer afford basic necessities... they&apos;re making Sophie&apos;s Choice every day. Eat/gas to get to work. Water bill/electric. 

I refuse to vote for Hillary Clinton because her record shows she works on behalf of the Business Party. She gives exploitative corporations like Wal-Mart, financial institutions, insurers, oil and gas, private healthcare, private prisons, and cornerstones of the military industrial complex a throne at the table where the rest of us crowd onto a single folding chair. It&apos;s buckling from the weight. 

Public servants serve the public. That&apos;s not a mind-boggling concept. They don&apos;t serve business. They don&apos;t compromise between people and business. They serve the people. They&apos;re supposed to protect the people from private interests that seek to profit from our exploitation and the exploitation of the commons we rely on âÂ the water supply (Flint), air quality, diminishing worker&apos;s rights, tax evasion, for starters. 

I refuse to vote for Hillary Clinton because she hasn&apos;t earned my vote. I won&apos;t vote for someone because, âThe system just *is* corrupt, so we need a snake who can outsnake the other guyâs snake.â No. 

Both our political and economic system are constructs built to serve the people. If they fail to serve the people, we have to demand more and get educated, involved, and relentless about its reform.

Yes, this is a great point that is seldom discussed.  The way economics is taught in the US, capitalism is a part of nature, the laws of supply and demand, etc., are taught as if they have the validity of the physical sciences, equal to the laws of thermodynamics, or gravity.   But economic relations are always social relations, and under capitalism, a very few come to dominate social relations (through wealth, or capital), so they also control economic relations (mostly by purchasing government).

Grammar! 
"Both our political and economic systems*" and "relentless about their reform." 

My apologies.

I am furious with this article.  Tom Hayden has long been one of my heroes and to read this cop-out and establishmentarian reasoning  and regurgitation of Hillary talking points could just make me cry.

Tom, I know John Dean is one of your old and dear friends, but this, really?

Are you really trying to make sure the Democratic Party fractures irredeemably and forces the creation of an entirely new party or a massive defection of Democrats and Independents to the Green Party?

If you want to unify the party for the general election, you had better get back behind Bernie and FAST.  You have just done the single most powerful thing possible to guarantee that Bernie supporters will not support Hillary in the general election.  

I have been consistently saying that I will support the eventual nominee, irrespective of which candidate gets the nomination.  No more.  I will not allow a traitorous revolutionary to betray the revolution.  If you continue to support Hillary for the nomination, I promise you that I do everything in my power to make sure she does not become President.  

I will fight for the creation of a new political party to reform American government from the ground up and for the permanent destruction of the Democratic Party.

I am absolutely astonished that you have done this contemptible thing.

Bravo, Stephen! I cannot give this enough "Likes." Robert Reich suggests we start a new party and call it The People&apos;s Party. I&apos;m with him! I will *never* vote for corruption, ever, no matter the potential "bad" outcome. I can&apos;t believe people are actually asking us to set aside our *morals* for political expediency. And I for one will never do it. Ever. Even a Donald Trump presidency isn&apos;t enough to get me to set my morality aside to vote for someone I believe will actually be more dangerous in innumerable ways. #BernieOrBastille

You sound like her for whom you advocate, Mr. Hayden: a lot of talk and not much substance. It is clear to all who have done their research that Hillary will bring us more war, more inequality and more delay on saving the planet from fossil fuels. My list of those whose political opinion is useless to me is growing. It now includes: Paul Krugman, Tom Hayden, Joan Walsh, Katharine Pollit and...

Dont forget Mara Liasson :(

Tom, this is disappointing.

That&apos;s an understatement.

It&apos;s obvious that nothing can  be done about Sanders supporters.  The "Sanders revolution" is a religious one, it&apos;s not political.  Sanders&apos; people "believe," they don&apos;t and will not "think."  Hayden speaks of "one" reason for voting for Hillary, there are least two reasons.  The one I just mentioned is the other one.
The realism of the Clinton approach would convince anyone concerned about the future of this country.  Instead, the "believers," not surprisingly, have turned Hillary into the devil, not the right-wing, delighted in this additional triumph over liberalism.   Hillary allows fracking in the most limited way possible.  But for the believers,  near complete control over this dangerous method won&apos;t do.   For the Sanders religion, it&apos;s all or nothing.  We&apos;re not making the  perfect the enemy of the good, we&apos;re making the perfect, in Hillary&apos;s case, the enemy of the near perfect.

Are you kidding me?  Why should I let the Beltway Think determine what is realistic or possible?  The system is corrupt to the core, and Hillary is part and parcel of anti-democracy Big Money politics.   You might want to reconsider who needs help with their thinking, along with the 51% who "approve" of Wall St Obama!

I&apos;m sorry but your wrong! I can not imagine voting for the status quo anymore. Who would be the candidate to help minorities not HRC. We need to dream a new world if we want to make this one better. It will not be HRC. She is tied to the 1% and big corporations. Another 4 years of this and the country may go down the tubes befor the next election. Hope you will change your mind befor you vote.

Thanks Tom- I am now more committed to Bernie than I ever was. Why not also say Hillary connects better with Jews as well as racial minorities? Hell, Israel will be happy. I am not sure what more Hillary brings to the table for minorities than does Bernie, other than she&apos;s married to the first "Black" President. I guess culture comfort counts for something. Look, I appreciate what you have said but be a bit more honest. Hillary is more qualified to be President because she meets the two major qualifications for the job and Bernie does not:
1. Keep waving the Imperial Flag and support the MIC and
2. Keep supporting the corporate occupation of government.

In all fairness it will be a slower bleed with her than with the Republicans.

I have read through over 20 posts in this thread, and see another problem, and another reason to vote for Hillary.  Doesn&apos;t the mindless way that "every" post is merely one more hate-Hillary outburst, create the tiniest doubt in your minds?  Aren&apos;t you indulging selfish fantasies, instead of the hard thinking necessary to win campaigns against the republicans?  
I&apos;m amazed to hear such nonsense in a post here, that "the young vote their hopes, the old their fears."
This typifies the frustration people feel in this unique campaign.  How can you reason with a youth that insists that he can vanquish the Right, with nothing more than his "hope," or see past real obstacles to "change" with the intensity of his demands.  I came nearly to blows when Hillary was fighting Obama for the presidency, facing an absolutely Obama-obsessed follower at a rally in L.A., an Obama follower, who is, now, likely pushing Obama under the bus, for his new Messiah.  Hillary can&apos;t help but have made big and small blunders throughout her political life, but you don&apos;t understand that people that venture out in the world, are the ones that often blunder.  Like a child, you think that people never change or improve.  Their are young people and old people.  But they don&apos;t stay young for long.   Presidential candidates don&apos;t determine the rate at which "change" occurs, reality does.  You throw rocks at Hillary and embrace your Messiah.  But, like all Messiah&apos;s, one day he will fall, and you&apos;ll fall with him.

I have read more than 20 of these posts and read a lot of Bernie over Hillary posts but not hate.  Apologizing for Hillary&apos;s many past blunders and then presenting her as the preferable candidate in spite of them is hard to comprehend.  I am 74 years old and am far from being a youth but I still have hope and will support someone who is willing to tackle those obstacles to change.  I don&apos;t hate Hillary but I sure don&apos;t respect her or trust her new-found liberalism.

Not a word of reason in this comment.  It is almost entirely ad hominem.  People who think Bernie is the better candidate -- based on his better platform, better character, greater electability, superior leadership skills, more consistent and reliable track record, greater honesty and transparency, and better judgment -- are labeled Hillary-haters, mindless, self-indulgent, prone to fantasies, immature, impressionable, messianic, childish, child-like, suggestible, and rock-throwers.

Argue for your limitations and you keep them.

I doubt many people see Bernie as the messiah, but they see him as fundamentally different from candidates from the past - he&apos;s working from the outside, not taking corporate cash, and has no laundry list of past inconsistencies in his voting record and has consistently voted the interests of working class people, not the wealthy. There&apos;s a plethora of evidence that Clinton votes for corporate interests on fundamental issues and that her voting record has been inconsistent with her stated ideals. All this can be shown within an hour&apos;s worth of researching even the mainstream media record. The reasons to vote for Sanders and withhold my vote from Clinton are clear and obvious. You&apos;re welcome to  challenge my impression of Sanders and Clinton. I don&apos;t pretend to have all the facts.

Mindlessly following Bernie, really? Perhaps it has something to do like &apos;small blunders&apos; of Clinton Like taking >$600K in cash for 3 hours of speeches to Goldman Sachs and refusing to release the transcripts? Like supporting military coups in other countries that leads to chaos and mass killing of civilians (think Honduras)? Like supporting Keystone pipeline and playing vague on fracking while using the power of the State Department to push for this dangerous and polluting technology all around the world?

I feel compelled to comment that this is the last kind of shit I want to see here. If I wanted to see all the supposed folks who "were" Bernie supporters but now find Hillary acceptable, I&apos;d still be reading Daily Kos.

I said the same thing up above. This and Joan Walsh&apos;s blather are not of any interest to me as a reader and subscriber.

I agree Sheila! Why is the Nation publishing this crap? For shame!

Absolutely right on, Sheila.  Thank you.

Because Tom fears the alternative is Lucifer, he opts to support his minion instead. Hyperbole? Hillary is working to export fracking technology globally, supports GMO companies efforts to commodify the food supply, is down with continuing to hold the US healthcare system hostage to the private health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and never saw a war or weapons system she couldn&apos;t justify. She is an imperialist; she makes no bones about continuing the failed fiction that American military preeminence equals the right to impose the will of corporate capitalists on all corners of the Earth that have not yet succumbed. She mistakenly believes we can continue such misappropriated investment of our energy while allowing our social base to wither and die. She is backed by the banks because they know her noise about reform is election year propaganda, as her idea of representing everyone means maintaining the status quo for the few who own half the wealth of the country. Viewing her through a global lens, she is a kinder, gentler, less misogynous, less racist (notice I did not say "not -" etc.), fascist. Tom, you are not even waiting to support her as an alternative to Trump or Ted Cruz or Paul Ryan, but are willing to ditch the possibility of choosing something other than the lesser of two evils, out of the fear that rooting for anything truly transformative could lead to a Republican victory. This type of thinking is killing us Tom. Climate change has raised the stakes. If we do not support renewables and tax carbon now (and maybe even if we do), soon hundreds of millions will not have a place to live. You conclude by re-playing the tune of your more radical roots, and say it will take all of us, but in this context you are implying we should succumb to our fears rather than work for our dreams. The young Tom Hayden would have seen it differently, I believe. America will get the leadership it deserves. The times require more courage than you are exemplifying here. 
We need to work for Bernie, up to the convention, and then for those same priorities he (and others more radical) choose to represent, regardless what face is put on "the reigns of power." We need systemic change. Hillary will not give us that. __ Charles Fredricks

Ah. I think I understand now.
After spending Sunday in a protest directed at the annual JNF Gala dinner, imagine my surprise when I read just now that Tom Hayden was honoured as "Legislator of the Year" by the Jewish National Fund among other organizations.(http://iop.harvard.edu/fellows/tom-hayden)
In case you&apos;re not aware, the JNF is a racist organization that takes tax-free donations in the western democracies to bull-doze Palestinian villages flat and plant them with trees. "Canada Park" in the West Bank is such an example.  This is a particularly virulent form of ethnic cleansing because it erases these villages from the map and from memory.  He apparently has many other connections to Israel, as well. His famous commitment to human rights may not include all humans.
Of course Bernie is now on the "outs" with the Israel Lobby because he hasn&apos;t completely toed the line with AIPAC. He&apos;s even making noises about justice for the Palestinians. Imagine the alarm.
No doubt we&apos;ll be hearing twisted and tortured arguments from lots of zionists, closet or otherwise, that Bernie just isn&apos;t the right choice for president.
Thanks, Tom, but you should be more open about your agenda.

Revelatory.

"I Used to Support Bernie, But Then I Changed My Mind" this is the elephant in the Democratic party. Defeatism trumped up as virtue. Compromise is a tactic. We need to negotiate like Unions, not like victims in a case action suit accepting first counter offer. Reality GOP is digging in regardless where you start. Look at how well Obama&apos;s Supreme Court nomination is going with him starting in the middle. We act is if because we bring a compromise to a knife fight we&apos;re somehow righteous. Are we children? To put it simply Sanders&apos; is a justice fighter and Clinton is a corporate lawyer. Compare they primary campaigns: for all Hillary&apos;s advantages her campaign will be remember as the naming calling campaign. Everyday there&apos;s another one of sexist squads surrogates with their P.C. labeling gun set to automatic. For Sanders&apos; for all his disadvantages he will always be remembered as working hard everyday to when the fight for us and we in kind then fight alongside him. And what the way the defeat the GOP for and while in the WH is to approach things as a struggle worth fighting for, not a court case needing to plea bargained.

I find this article to be very sad. Im a 29 year old Bernie Sanders supporter and to be honest im having a harder and harder time seeing a good future for myself through the establishment democratic party. I flip through the msm channels every day and hear nothing but vitriol, misrepresentation and sometimes outright lies about Bernie. A beautiful thing like Bernie being invited to go speak at the Vatican about a moral economy, instead to the msm becomes him just pandering to Latinos. I see Bill Clinton talk down to a African American woman who is simply asking him to awnser for all the pain and destruction that his crime bill caused, and then in his own words he almost apoligized. I feel bad for liberals like you sir becuase if Hillary wins the nomination as soon as Bernie has bowed out, your blood will go cold as Hillary tacks to the right and ruthlessly steps on every progressive talking point she used during the primary to convince liberals like your self to vote for her. And then the supposed electibility that people think she has as the rightwing digs up all the corruption of the clintons through the decades and spews it forth for a generation of Americans that hold no great loyalty to partisanship or the Clintons. I have voted for democrats every two years since I turned 18 and i have often urged my millenial friends to do the same, only for them to say that they see no real difference between either party, but then Bernie came and finally they could see a difference. This election is different, now is not the time to hide and triangulate but rather for democrats to raise up the battle flag of the new deal democrats of old. I am not that familiar with your history Mr. Hayden but judging from commenters it seems that you have struggled for the progressive cause for a long time. But i believe that right now you are scared, scared of Trump, scared of being disappointed and perhaps even scared of change. In the words of Bernie "I beg of you do not enter that world of despair stand up Mr. Hayden, go once more into the breach and fight for a future that my generation can believe in.

Nominating Clinton is the surest way to make Donald Trump or Ted Cruz President.

Jimmy, that was great. I couldn&apos;t have said it better.

Thank you Mr. Petersen that means alot.

Tom:  In the 60&apos;s I attended a lecture by Saul Alinski  on the UW campus, where he warned students against "...believing our own shit".  Tom, you are doing just that 50 years later!   You are embracing the most egregious collection of establishment dysfunction with your support of the very things you argue against!   
Hill and Bill have become obscenely wealthy by tapping into the money stream that has bled the wealth from the world&apos;s middle class.   Together, their take has been over $100 million.   Bernie has accumulated wealth of less than $1 million after 35 yrs in government.
The Clinton&apos;s have fracked our aquifers, free traded our jobs, deregulated Wall Street, militarily destabilized countries, embraced horrific policies like the Saudi&apos;s brutality and Kissinger&apos;s &apos;Total Control&apos;, legislated minorities into jail and generally have become wealthy by their actions.
Bernie opposes the establishment policies you claim to disdain yet you support Hillary.  You tremble in the face ofï»¿ "...an overwhelming wall of opposition from the Republican Congress...",  which, at this time is, at the very most, a fractured party of religious extremists and Teabaggers, in power only because Obama lost the progressive vote when he sold out to establishment power.  Those progressives will return in waves behind a real progressive candidate and Congress will change accordingly.  ï»¿
 You shudder at an "...all-out Republican-financed media assault..."  but fail to recognize that establishment backed efforts by the media to twist our democracy,  and the DNC&apos;s  &apos;super delegate&apos; dysfunction, are also fully recognized as blatant disregard of our democratic process by responsible voters, and serve to further marshall their resolve and accelerate support for Bernie.  
You  "...intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. "  failing to mention that it was Bernie, not Hillary who marched beside MLK in the Freedom Marches, and Bernie who was jailed trying to integrate Chicago housing in the 60&apos;s.   Where was Hillary in these dangerous times?   Not in the front lines where she should have been as a true supporter of racial equality.  You go on to mention  "...my sense is that California is winnable for Bernie."  I&apos;m at a loss to explain your reasoning.
You rightly point out that "..Bernie is more dovish and Hillary still harbors an inner hawk."    You go on to say "... (Bernie) correctly faults Hillary for her hawkish impulse towards regime change."   Yet you back Hillary.   Do you feel we need more of the failed wars and policies that have produced millions of destroyed families, and ISIS?
Other comments in your article that resonate:   "When she seems to tack back towards her roots, it is usually in response to Bernie and new social movements..... ".    "I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman ."   Yes, but surely not this woman!
Your article is lame.  Your reasoning is unsound.  How is it that we read this, from the leader and author of radical social change in the 60&apos;s?  I expected far more.

Yes, indeed.  A far cry from the Port Huron Statement.

The young vote their hopes. The old vote their fears. What we have among too many of mine (and Tom&apos;s) generation is what I call George McGovern Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (GMPTSD) where voting for your hopes instead of your fears is deemed suicidal. It made a generation risk adverse and militant only about the most miniscule of reforms.  Every election the DP elite draws lurid pictures of Republican storm troopers spitting and roasting your children over an open fire, and any disorder or restlessness in the DP ranks disappears.  A lot of the vitriol directed at the Clintons comes from Bill&apos;s status as one of our truly great Republican presidents and it comes not from the novices who feel the Bern, but Tom and my generations feeling of betrayal by him. Underneath all the worship of the Clintons indulged in by pundits and the chattering classes was a desire for pay back.  A desire that has fueled a lot of oldsters who are backing Bernie.  I am not overly worried about Bernie supporters letting Hillary swing in the breeze. Bernie has repeatedly repudiated the Bernie or Busters and if Hillary cannot garner enthusiasm well that is Hillary&apos;s fault - not ours.  People talk big in the primaries, but come September or October they will change their tune.  Finally, the real story this year is the collapse of Clintonism and the rise of a new left that Hillary will not be able to forget about should she get into the White House.  That battle is just starting, but I know in places like Cleveland we are already planning how to keep the Bernie momentum going post November.  As for me I always have followed Molly Ivins advice to vote your heart in the primaries and head in the general.  If Hillary, or J. Fred Muggs, or Jack the Ripper gets the DP nomination I will support them. Until then I will support Bernie till the last dog is dead.

Of course, there&apos;s some truth in what you say, Randy, but we can see in the bright light of New York that there are still enough old farts who believe hope is not a four-letter word. (oh shit, it is, isn&apos;t it!) In my case, I&apos;m a soon-to-be 80-year-old, line-drive-hitting, southpaw, hitting .300 in a 40+ hardball league, who is one of Bernie&apos;s kids.  BTW, somebody remind Hillary&apos;s surrogates who want to portray Bernie as sexist that calling Bernie "grouchy" and "grumpy" are ageist terms.

It&apos;s really not this convoluted.  Reading this was torture, as you seem to be tortured with your own arguments.  I&apos;m sorry, but a clear mind and true heart are all you need.  If you don&apos;t like Bernie, fine.  But there is not even one argument for Hillary that is compelling.  I&apos;m not sure what you are doing, trying to convince others that you have a reason to vote for Hillary, or trying to convince yourself.  I feel sad for you, even with your obvious command of "facts."  You have managed to talk yourself out of voting for the best candidate.

Or serving as the Devil&apos;s Advocate?

Hey, look on the bright side. Maybe Tom will treat us to a column after Clinton II awards him the Medal of Freedom with Henry Kissinger in attendance to warmly shake his hand.

With Clinton I in the West Wing (not the East, that is "for choosing china and planning tea parties" - Bill Clinton, 2016)

"ï»¿ No matter how much they agree with Bernie on the issues, no matter what doubts they hold about the Clintons, those running for election or reelection are unlikely to see themselves as benefiting from having a democratic socialist/independent at the top of the ticket. " Themselves as benefiting! Themselves! As someone who was very active in 1968 politics, and spent a lot of time with Dave Dellinger during the Chicago trials, I remember being nonplussed when Mr. Hayden ran for office. I guess this addresses the idea of changing the system from within. Join the system, flourish in the system, become the system. Worked for Hillary and Tom. Neither was trusted by voters in order to "see themselves as benefiting". Yet, they both did. Bernie or bust!

Are you kidding? Of course Hilary will implement her wonderful programs. As soon as she checks with her overlords. And they&apos;re sure to be on board because as we all know, change comes down from the top. 
Has Hilary now become so desperate that she is now paying well known "lefties" to shill for her?  I wonder.

I am a 66 year old "sixties radical" if anything I am more radical today then back in the Summer of Love. I have been disappointed by Mr. Hayden for decades, now I only feel disgust by how tamed he is.  Shame on you it&apos;s more about Power to the People and Kick Out The Jams now then it ever was. I&apos;d sooner vote for Trump to hasten the inevitable collapse of a system that is rigged and lost it&apos;s way than vote for a hero of the status quo

Like so many other commenters in this thread, I too lament the capitulation of Tom Hayden to a corrupt, irredeemable status quo system of endless war and crony capitalism. As an activist who drew inspiration from Tom Hayden starting in my formative years until today&apos;s article, I&apos;m dismayed that he has abandoned a once in a lifetime candidate, Bernie Sanders, who literally cannot and will not be bought, and who therefore can say NO to the forces of greed and entrenched power. I registered as a Democrat this year after 40 years as an progressive Independent who eschews partisan politics, just so I can vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary, and with the providence of clear thinking voters, in the general election. All the nuanced, hand-wringing he goes through in this piece ignores the two salient and inextricably connected issues of our time, Climate Change from the burning of fossil fuels, and a rigged economy propped up by crony capitalism and its self-serving, corrupt campaign finance system. Naomi Klein illuminated this brilliantly in her piece last week, "The Problem With Hillary Clinton Isn&apos;t Just Her Corporate Cash. It&apos;s Her Corporate Worldview." The inescapable and objective fact of Climate Change is that it can and will overwhelm our individual and collective ability to deal with social and economic justice issues unless and until we make a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels to a renewable energy future, while at the same time acknowledging and acting upon the reality that this means there will be winners and losers, the latter being the fossil fuel corporations and the Wall Street Banks that finance their plunder. Hillary Clinton is a product, enabler, and benefactor of this dysfunction and is therefore unsuited to the task of holding the line and saying NO to the status quo. It goes against the Clinton mantra of win, win win. The inimitable Robert Reich, a Bernie Sanders supporter, says it perfectly: "Hillary Clinton is the best candidate for the (corrupt) system we have. Bernie Sanders is the best candidate for the system we need." Come on Tom. Get back on the bus and help us attain a "future we can believe in." Feel the Bern.

You b the man Philip...... live long and spread the word

"My second worry about Bernieâs candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If heâs the nominee, that will be merciless."

At the moment Hayden made this comment, I realized that this article had some kind of ulterior motive.  This is just an absolutely absurd statement.  Insofar as you should worry about any Republican attack on any Democratic nominee ever, it&apos;s understandable.  But Bernie Sanders has one of the most consistent and comparatively impeccable progressive records of any candidate in decades.  To say this without acknowledging that Hillary Clinton has a higher disapproval rating than approval rating, that the majority of Americans don&apos;t trust her, and the fact that we all know that the Republicans will throw everything from Benghazi to the email servers to Libya at her (regardless of the legitimacy of the attacks) makes Hayden&apos;s "worry about Bernie&apos;s candidacy" seem disingenuous, laughable and ludicrous.

Not just "everything from Benghazi to the email servers to Libya" but also everything about Bill&apos;s presidency and everything about Bill since then, including the "Lolita Express" and the Clinton Foundation and Haiti and . . . .

have held clearances, worked in various law enforcement, security and investigative positions, and have also been a democratic activist for 40+ years. But Hillary&apos;s "casual" approach to her possibly pending indictment worries the hell out of me.

Although I do strongly support Bernie&apos;s candidacy, I still wouldn&apos;t like to see Hillary go to prison. So I started looking for answers, to see if there was anything I could do or say that might help keep Hillary out of prison.

And then I discovered a <i>RealClearPolitics</i> article by Charles Lipson that discussed how Hillary&apos;s violations of State Department security protocols could engender âpainful legal choicesâ for DOJ and the White House.
Excerpt: <i>[The Attorney General&apos;s] choice between blind justice and political calculation is almost certain to confront Loretta Lynch, once the FBI concludes its investigation into Hillary Clinton, her top aides, and the Clinton Foundation.</i>

The article continues to discuss <i>âkey legal dangers facing Clinton and her aides ...â</i> in some detail.
Details are HERE:

Read it for yourself.

The fact that Hayden almost entirely ignores the issue of campaign finance reform is aggravating.  With the exception of an obligatory nod to Citizens United, he fails to make the connection that the corrupt campaign finance system has with every single issue he has pointed out, as well as certainly all others: None of this can get done in any significant, sustainable manner without overhauling the campaign finance system.  In a sense, I am a single-issue voter on this situation.  We will not make any ground on climate change without campaign finance reform.  We will not make ground on economic inequality without campaign finance reform.  The list goes on virtually forever.  A Hillary Clinton presidency will bring with it no progress on this reform, I am absolutely confident of that.  And the fact that Hayden treats this as only a passing interest is beyond me.

As a born Michigander and UC Berkeley Alumni who has followed both Tom Hayden&apos;s career and Hillary&apos;s for many years, I am shocked at this piece.  Tom Hayden must know that Hillary was a Goldwater Girl in her teens. She married Bill and became a DINO.  She also is a chronic liar; so there is no evidence to suggest that her recent efforts to "tack left" would mean a thing if she became President and was in a position to do anything she pleased.  Frankly, her neocon Foreign Policy alone should disqualify her.  What are the odds that this good friend of Henry Kissinger and the Kagan family would suddenly "see the light?"  Think about her position on the Iraq War and her tenure at the State Deparment re: Ukraine, Benghazi, Syria and Iran; then please tell Nation readers why her Foreign Policy record would suggest that a Hillary Presidency would be in this country&apos;s best interests.  
Syria and Iran

Tom,
Bernie is "the start"... whether he wins or not... of the revolution to bring neo progressiveness back to its Democratic roots.  You wimped out and sold out to corporate oligarchic current mime.

Funny thing, but in the last two weeks or two there has hardly been a word by a Clintonian. Weeks before, they swarmed like gnats, using the same old "sexist, racist, unicorn, single-issue" talking points. But then . . . silence. It&apos;s like the Clinton campaign drew back its snipers because they weren&apos;t working and replaced them with the Big Gun (Hayden). But he doesn&apos;t seem to be doing the job either. I wonder what&apos;s next?

Tom, I was here in the SFV when you spoke for a moment before Bernie spoke to the small crowd.  It was amazing for me to see you there supporting Bernie.  So it&apos;s a shock to say the least to read this article.  You&apos;ve actually misstated some of Bernie&apos;s positions, and some of the things you&apos;re bring to mind a scene of someone from Hillary&apos;s campaign sitting you down to explain in a biased way why you&apos;ve been wrong to support Bernie.  For example, you claim that Bernie just wants to end fracking with no contingency plan.  That&apos;s plain false.  He has called for an end to oil subsidies and a carbon tax to pay for much MORE renewable infrastructure than Hillary imagines.  Fracking needs to end, and Bernie will bring us to a point where we can do that more quickly than Hillary, who doesn&apos;t seem to want to end fracking at all, after spreading it around the world to vulnerable areas with voiceless populations and lacking environmental protections.  It&apos;s false Clinton campaign narrative that says he would slow down implementation of the Paris Agreement.  Also, you write as if the racial divisiveness present in this campaign are Bernie&apos;s doing.  In fact, he reached out to BLM and other groups and has a comprehensive racial and social justice platform that no other candidate has, while Clinton spoke down to BLM and threw BLM protesters out of her rallies.  And finally, Tom, seriously, she literally takes foreign policy advice from Kissinger.  I never thought I&apos;d hear you say that it&apos;s time to stop fighting for fairness, sit down, be quiet, settle for what&apos;s being offered, it&apos;s just too hard . . . 
Really disappointing.

Yes, this thing is so flimsy, so poorly argued, that it makes on think of a hostage video.

That is hilarious if we don&apos;t think of a real hostage.

I should also add that Bernie actually wrote and passed legislation that paid for energy efficiency and solar arrays on thousands of homes.  In other words, he&apos;s already responsible for more legislative progress on renewable energy than his opponents.  So to say this is something he has no plan for or can&apos;t accomplish is just, again, plain false.

Mr Hayden, As a long-time resident of California, you have not had the disagreable experience of being represented in the Senate by Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton represented me, a female New York voter, as Senator. I had high hopes when I voted for her in 2000, hopes which were soon replaced by a sense of betrayal. Too many "which way is the wind blowing", expedient/opportunistic Senate votes, including Iraq war of course. A pity, because at at that time she had the popular support (Democratic New York), which would have enabled her to take a stand on issues, to lead in a progressive direction. She chose not to do so. And I chose not to vote for her relection to the Senate. Clinton had my trust once, and lost it. 

I have admired Sanders for a long time; for me this 2016 choice is easy.

PS I am a long-time resident of Switzerland, an Ã¼ber-capitalist country but with health insurance for all, publicly supported higher education, good social safety net, great infrastructure, SOUND PUBLIC FINANCES, and where (yippee!) "REDISTRIBUTION" is an avowed government aim. Switzerland has a large Socialist party, and "democratic socialist" doesn&apos;t mean much at all here, since it describes so many of us in Europe. Bernie would fit in well.

The trouble with Bernie is that he is not presidential.  He won&apos;t be able to govern, even if he wins.  He just does not have the experience or the depth.  He has done a great job in moving Clinton to the Left, and she bids fair to keep up that momentum.  Bernie is doing great in mobilizing the youth.  That is not enough -- Clinton can get a lot of great people to work for her (especially now that the old Rubin clan has been thoroughly discredited.  The combination of Clinton and Elizabeth Warren will be especially powerful in Washington -- where it is what it is all about (the Red states are gone).  As for war, anybody can see that there are no wars worth fighting now -- even Clinton (and as Kerry can well advise her).  We got to win this one, guys, and Bernie simply cannot and he has no qualifications to govern.

Hahahahahaha.  ROFL.  My sides are splitting.  Sorry, I know I shouldn&apos;t be laughing when the stakes are this high.  But really, this is just too unreal, pant, wheeze.

Qualifications?   When Hill and Bill came to Washington in 1992, they were worth, financially, about $700,000 (Washington Post). Today they are valued at well over $100,000,000. Obscene wealth, collected on the backs of the other guy (us), by saying and doing the right things to tap into the money stream. If that makes Hill &apos;Qualified for the presidency&apos;, then she&apos;s over qualified.

Unlike Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders actually has elected, political Executive experience, serving as mayor of Burlington, Vermont for two consecutive terms. Look at his record and see what great things he accomplished. This is about leadership, not just the mechanics of government. If that is the issue, Bernie Sanders has more than twice the legislative experience of Hillary Clinton and knows how Congress works, something Hillary short-changed herself (and her constituents) in her AWOL tenure as the Senator from New York.

Actually, Bernie served four consecutive terms as mayor of Burlington ("reelected three times).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders

Tom Hayden is a very honorable guy, entitled to his opinion and his vote.  Bernie Sanders is Step 1 to a functioning economy, healthcare as a human right, a cleaner greener globe, and a democratic republic that is of, for and by the people.  I see no downside to a Sanders presidency when lined up against HRC.

Except that like another nice guy Pres. Carter, Sanders won&apos;t accomplish near as much as Clinton could.

Jimmy Carter and Bernie Sanders are both great men.  Jimmy&apos;s difficulties had nothing to do with being "a nice guy."  Bernie&apos;s track record in Congress suggests that he will accomplish much more than Clinton would, and what he accomplishes will be much better than anything Clinton would accomplish.  I cannot perceive any downsides to a Sanders presidency; the likely downsides of a Hillary Clinton presidency are legion.

If you base your opinions on crap you will get crap conclusions so look at your sources.

Considering what Hillary has accomplished in her tenure in office in Washington â disastrous, illegal war in Iraq, regime change in Honduras resulting in the assassination of Berta Caceras,  corrupt government taking over in Haiti, the NATO bombing of Libya creating a vacuum that extremist groups have filled, pushing the trade deal with Panama even though she knew it would make the problems of global tax evasion worse, etc. â let&apos;s hope Bernie won&apos;t accomplish as much as her!

Wait &apos;til she is in charge. If Bernie wins the nomination I&apos;ll vote for NRA Bernie because Bernie is still better than a Repub. but not by much.

NRA Bernie?? Bernie has a D- rating from the NRA.

I heard that Bernie was or still is an NRA member, and NRA people that feel manly when they have a gun in their hand.

Clinton can accomplish nothing without the help of her elite owners. And they like things the way they are. What is your real agenda?

ï»¿ Mr. Hayden, please acknowledge that the Clintons&apos; cynical triangulation hurt the weakest, the most vulnerable and most defenseless members of society. As Senator Ted Kennedy said, "The last thing our country needs is a second Republican party." Senator Sanders is from, in the late Senator Paul Wellstone&apos;s words, "The Democratic wing of the Democratic party."

So is Senator Al Franken and he supports HRC. I believe that&apos;s because she can get more of what Bernie wants done than Bernie can.

Hate to harp on the point but Franken is a well-known supporter of the brutal Israeli occupation:
http://muftah.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0554-1024x768.jpg?6727d7
HRC has abased herself in front of AIPAC. Bernie&apos;s support is less rabid. That&apos;s why Franken is on board with Hilary.

They still don&apos;t get what the revolution is about... it&apos;s not about defeating the Republicans; it is about defeating the establishment, economic elites that control BOTH parties.  Republicans  want to sink the ship, Democrats keep it afloat... but we are still sailing in the wrong direction.  

IF, IF, IF Hillary wins, the democrats will have gone with the candidate who is the total antithesis of the movement the Bernie folks are trying to create.  This is NOT like 2008.  There is a much bigger difference between Bernie and Hillary than there was between her and Obama.  Many Bernie folks are not Democrats or only became a democrat to vote for him in this primary.  There should be no loyalty to a party that has no loyalty towards working families and the democratic process.  Being better than the Republicans is not enough.

"The Revolution" is the people, it&apos;s not the titular head of government. It&apos;s we the people who need to hold our pols accountable and to get things accomplished. The "fight for 15" success was because of protesters putting themselves on the line. It was not Bernie.  It will never be because of him or any one person calling for "revolution". It&apos;s the people&apos;s revolution, always will be.

Hillary Clinton was my senator. I voted for her. She was tested as a leader and she acted like a sheep, afraid to not appear tough. As far as I&apos;m concerned she betrayed the country but particularly New Yorkers when she voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 and she did it for her benefit, not ours. Iraq was never a threat to the US. That was obvious to anyone with any good sense at all. We cannot afford another mistake like that, the stakes are too too high. We need someone to call the people to action. Someone with a track record of integrity, not scandal. That is the only way we have a hopes chance of doing what must be done. Bernie is calling. Hillary is managing.

Trump is the only candidate with higher negatives than Clinton. Time for Hillary to withdraw and unite the party behind Bernie to defeat the GOP.

Absolutely!

Mr. Hayden, please acknowledge that the Clintons&apos; cynical triangulation hurt the weakest, the most vulnerable and most defenseless members of society. As Senator Ted Kennedy said, "The last thing our country needs is a second Republican party." Senator Sanders is from, in the late Senator Paul Wellstone&apos;s words, "The Democratic wing of the Democratic party."

Sorry--this ended up as a reply when it was supposed to be new comment.

Oh how I wish! And as much chance of that happening as there is of a pig flying to the Clintons&apos; home on Martha&apos;s Vineyard.

It is sad to see Tom Hayden, of all people, abandon the most viable hope we have seen in this country for precisely the kinds of changes he has said he wanted to see come to pass since the &apos;60s.  He must know that what Bernie proposes is precisely an maintenance and possible expansion of New Deal and Great Society legislation on the domestic front.  He must also know that Clinton is not progressive in any sense of the term, nor is she anything but hawkish, not simply because of her Iraq war vote, but because of a succession of statements and actions.  It is for good reason that President Carter has noted that she did not work for peace.  But most of all, if Hayden is genuinely concerned about the plight of minorities in this country, his stand for Clinton is genuinely unfathomable.  I was on a street corner on Broad Street, next to City Hall in Newark, in 1967.  I saw the very beginning of the riots that tore the Central Ward apart so that, when I returned from Vietnam and went up to High Street {now MLK Boulevard} and Belmont and looked down, it might as well have been Dresden after the bombing.  If there is one thing Hillary Clinton is not, it is someone who is genuinely committed to the plight of the poor and minorities in this country.  Aside from whatever she may say these days as compared with her "super-predator" remarks about young blacks needing to be "brought to heel" -- a dig that was directly aimed to garner votes in the south -- her support for tougher incarceration that has devastated minority communities, her support for charter schools and privatization, her support for welfare &apos;reform&apos; ... All this and much more speak volumes about her opportunistic turns toward her goal of the Presidency.  When black leaders and activists like Ben Jealous and Harry Belafonte stand with Bernie, I&apos;m not sure where Hayden comes off suggesting that they are wrong.  That Clinton has managed to garner the support of the CBC SuperPAC and sitting congressmen and women is no surprise.  Here in Vermont, a state that gives chance apiece to Republicans and Democrats in the governor&apos;s chair, where Bernie pulled more than 70% of the vote  in last race for Senate and 86% in the recent primary, both our other sitting Senator, Pat Leahy, and our Governor, Peter Shumlin, both endorsed Hillary even as Bernie announced his candidacy.  Clinton is, without doubt, the preferred candidate of a Democratic Party that has been running from the new Deal and the Great Society legislation ever since Nixon took the White House with his &apos;southern strategy&apos;.  The flight from true liberalism was insured for the next 40 years with Reagan&apos;s two victories.  The current Democratic Party establishment is center-right, at best.  They have made one concession after another to the increasingly rabid-right that has become the Republican Party.  And that party has shown that it is incapable of governing itself, much less the country.  Nonetheless, a turn to Hillary BEFORE the primary and caucus voting is over is nothing more than an abandonment of the field to the forces that have been rolling back the New Deal and the Great Society legislation that mas mattered most, and no amount of rationalizing can make the decision an honest one.  At best, Clinton represents the status quo, and it is precisely the status quo of the past half-century that is the problem.

I don&apos;t think that Hayden is abandoning anything. He is rather raising a key issue here regarding race in the United States (and in a historical sense, one that applies to the entire western hemisphere.) Yes, we have a class structure. Yes, class is critical. Yes, we need strategies to push forward agendas of economic equality. However, there are two elephants in the room that are in stark relief during this election cycle. First, that class structure that exists in the US is built on a foundation of white supremacy (and also patriarchy.) The white left in this country, despite the many generation-long struggle against racism, still has not been able to grasp this. Second, the demographic shift underway in the US right under our noses portends the need for strategies that involve leadership of/by/for African descendant, Latino, Asian descendant and Indigenous people. White progressives are at their own peril in ignoring this, and are overlooking the very coalition necessary to elect and re-elect Obama as President.

Only  Bernie Sanders has broad-based support in the combo you cite: "African descendant, Latino, Asian descendant and Indigenous people."  So how can you deem Hayden right?

There is no rationale for expecting that Hillary will serve people of color better than Sanders. Raising the minimum wage, ending the war on drugs, and providing healthcare to everyone are ideas that would lift up those most oppessed. If MSM had given the Sanders candidacy fair reporting, southern people of color may have come to that conclusion in time to change their votes...and then you would have no reason to bring up this argument.

Well, Noam Chomsky was interviewed on Aljazeera&apos;s program Up Front recently. I recommend listening to it. Chomsky explained that if he was a voter in a swing state in the general election and HC is the nominee, even he would vote for HC over any Republican, because although the differences between the parties are few, they are very important differences. I believe he is supporting Sanders in the primaries. 
http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/01/chomsky-vote-clinton-republicans-160129065258571.html

Hayden lost his Port Huron progressive credibility long ago and has been as much a part of the "liberal-but-not-progressive" wing of the Democratic party for years. The liberals are the "pragmatists" who never make waves and never lead the charge (as Hayden once did). Voters are pissed at the party establishments and no one is more establishment than Hillary. The anti-Hillary vote in a general election will render her unelectable; so much for pragmatism! Bernie is a rare opportunity for true progressives. Pushing Hillary to the left is pure fantasy and will last only as long as she thinks she needs progressive votes. Her triangulating, finger-to-the-wind approach is exactly why we are in the political quagmire we are now in. Hayden does not belong in the pages of The Nation anymore.

I could not agree with you more

It&apos;s sad reading this essay remembering Tom Hayden as a leader of the movement against the Vietnam War. And it&apos;s also ironic, being a Vietnam veteran, who also voted for Bernie Sanders in the Ohio primary, to see Hayden throwing him under the Hillary Clinton campaign bus with his endorsement for her. I have no animus against Hayden for his stand against the Vietnam War. He was right, and I was wrong. But he is wrong now giving up on Sanders. It&apos;s just quite strange to see Tom Hayden as an old man compromising himself when in his youth he has such conviction, a fire in his belly.  Maybe, T.S. Eliot was right. The world ends with a whimper rather than a bang. Hayden has sold its soul to the machine politics in the Democratic Party. Uncle Ho is turning like a lathe in his grave right now for you. You sold out, Tom.

....said I was not going to comment since so many people have done so very effectively...Tom, don&apos;t include this African-American in the reasons you must vote for HRC....get off the post-revolutionary band wagon....stop looking at us in a paternalistic, let me help you manner....also stop treating us as some monolithic sub-culture.....I have no more in common with Black folk who believe the Clinton&apos;s are great because they come to Black churches than I do with the tooth fairy...in Illinois the vote between Bernie supporters and HRC was only a large margin where the people were more uneducated and tended to believe what their respective pastors told them...in Nevada it was just about even...for those who actually have followed HRC, she and her husband were great disappointments... but don&apos;t ever tell the rest of the world that you are making this political choice based upon race...that is the most disingenuous, patriarchal   piece of crap I have heard since Bill shouted down the Black Lives Matter group....if you sell out blame it on something else....

....as I was reading the comments and trying to word one, I came across yours....you said what I was feeling in every cell of my body....no need to comment now, it would be redundant :)

Poor Tom, he is abandoning his anti war positions to support a person who believes in regime change.  How sad.  Looking forward to more Iraq wars are we Tom?  When did you become a supporter of the number one military industrial complex in the world?

There are so many subjects where Hillary has proven beyond a doubt that she is dishonest and completely untrustworthy, I will give one example, there are many, many, Hillary was campaigning on Long Island recently regarding gun violence, in 2008m Senator Obama called her  ""ANNIE OAKLEY"" WHY, she was going to rural areas and promoting guns desperately trying to appeal to voters, she said " iF I am president i will not let them take your guns away""
 fear mongering and just untrue. no one was proposing that, Hillary is the worst public figure since Nixon, am 79 year old liberal/ progressive and so ashamed of Hillary

She also told a fairy tale about how she was taught to shoot by her father, and currently is telling bald-faced lies about guns purportedly coming into New York from Vermont.

I think that is a little extreme don&apos;t you think?  Worse than G W Bush?  Worse than Uncle Ronald Reagan (666)?  Actually Nixon was the last fairly decent republican president.  They have only gotten worse.  Looking back, it is a shame today&apos;s republicans don&apos;t have a Richard Nixon.  He would be considered too pinko commie today.   He was bad don&apos;t get me wrong, my point is that one doesn&apos;t need to go back to Nixon to find the worst public figure.

Ugh, what a disappointment your are in reciting the clintonian narrative.  Every move Clinton made as a young adult and beyond have been predicated by one priority: political expediency.  There is only one Hillary, the one who will appear to move in any political direction as long as it gets her to whatever goal she sets for herself.

Hayden is one of the few leftists from the 1960s that actually got involved in the political process as a legislator.  He understands how the process works and what it takes to make changes.  

I was involved in the Occupy movement and have been a Sanders supporter for years, and was also a part of the elected political process at the local and county levels.  

I bow to Hayden&apos;s hard won wisdom.  You can talk the talk, but it&apos;s a whole different story when you&apos;ve actually been in the trenches.  There&apos;s no wisdom like that which is earned through actual participation in government decision making.

Young folks (I&apos;m nearly 70) have been one of my major concerns for years, and there&apos;s nothing more I want than for my grandchildren (who are adults) and the rest of their generation to have as good or better life opportunities than I&apos;ve had, but having been part of the system I can assure you that steps forward are always incremental and it takes a sustained effort to keep things going in the right direction.

Back in the 1960s there were liberal thinking people who thought it would be a good idea to elect George Wallace for president.  Their thinking was if he was elected the whole country would collapse and then we could start anew.  That was dumb thinking then and it is dumb thinking now.

Hopefully the young will have the patience to stay in the fight for the long haul and become part of the solution by running for office or supporting those who do, at the local, state and federal levels.  And hopefully, they will realize that right now any democrat is better for their future than the republicans.  If you don&apos;t believe me, check out the states that have implemented progressive changes like increased minimum wages and family leave and such.  None are republican states.

If Clinton gets the nomination, please don&apos;t bow out or vote for someone who can&apos;t win.  Keep moving ahead incrementally and you will bring about the changes you are looking for.

Retch!  Bernie&apos;s been in the trenches longer and more successfully than anyone.  Wisdom of Tom Hayden?  More like the opposite.  He has abandoned what he once stood for, to now give it lip service at best, while trying to capitalize on his former gravitas.

Wisely said! and maybe you and others have heard that in the Wisconsin caucus, 15% of Sanders voters did not vote for any democrat down the line resulting in the loss of a supreme court position by a capable progressive judge. Are these the people who skipped voting in the 2010 and 2014 elections because there was no "sexy" candidate resulting in the most reactionary of republicans taking the House and Senate?

This is a lie.  The exist polling showed that 15% of Sanders supporters either did not remember or did not vote for Kloppenberg in the downballot Supreme Court justice race.  A substantial, but lower, percentage of Hillary voters also answered that way.  The numerical analysis of the election results showed that even if 100% of Bernie voters had voted for Kloppenberg, she still would have lost.  This is anti-Bernie spin, poor spin at that, nothing more.

It sounds about right that 15% of voters don&apos;t see a reason to support run-of-the-mill democrats, most of them are a disappointment to me. I only vote for the ones that I think have earned my vote.

I&apos;m 64 years old and tired of waiting for the establishment Democrats - Republican-lites - to return to the principles that FDR brought to bear on US politics in creating Social Security and similar programs. It&apos;s not just young people who want to see REAL change from the elitist, corporatist narrative adhered to now by too many Democrats in power. I am so disappointed in this essay and its author&apos;s conclusion! I remain committed to Bernie Sanders.

I am 76 years old and also feel that we should go back to the principles of FDR&apos;s New Deal.  Bernie did an excellent job formulating the main issues.  The liberal economists, and other liberals who criticized him, should instead work out more detailed programs that can accomplish what he formulated.  I do not believe that it is that difficult.  With regard to the costs, the investigations I have been able to do, indicate that going back to the high taxes on the wealthy during and after World War II, under FDR, Truman and Eisenhower, may be adequate.  Perhaps Tom Hayden and the liberal economists criticizing Bernie can put their energy on investigating that in more depth.
By the way, I have lived and worked the past 48 years in the USA, but was born and raised in the Netherlands and was raised by adults who went through the World War II nightmare + I always had a great interest in history.  The present confusion, almost Worldwide, about the principles of good and fair government seem to be very similar and about as bad as the confusion about those issues in the late 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;s.  It will take a large effort to fix things, like it did then, and we have about three times as many people on the earth that have to be fed, clothed and housed.  We need as large an effort as World War II to fix things, with the emphasis on giving everybody on earth a fair deal, before we have a World War III with destruction and suffering as never seen before.  And we have to start with that at home.
Also, as an engineer who has designed equipment that is used in the offshore oil and gas industry and who has criticized oil and gas drilling in the arctic, I feel that I have the obligation to point out to Tom Hayden and others that the issues of climate change and energy policy are very complex technical issues, which in my judgment should not be politicized, but handled through extensive public hearings and environmental impact studies.  I believe that Bernie would not have a problem with that, but perhaps The Nation can ask him.

Evelyn, have you forgotten Medicare, which was passed by the Johnston administration, and let&apos;s not forget the Affordable Care Act, which even though it&apos;s not universal health care (which Hilary Clinton proposed back in the 1990s) it was the best Obama could do in the political climate of that time.  You can be disappointed in the article, but you can&apos;t say the democrats haven&apos;t been trying.

You missed the big picture here, Tom. That is so unlike you. It&apos;s the youth vote. The people who are going to be the progenitors of the changes some of us have fighting for over the decades. Who are they lining up behind regardless of color? It&apos;s not Clinton.

I respect Tom Hayden for his life&apos;s work, but I&apos;m disappointed in the Milquetoast arguments he&apos;s given here for postponing what many of us have been waiting a lifetime for--a candidate who really stands for just about everything we&apos;ve always stood for in America. Even Hayden admits this, but then says he&apos;ll vote for Hillary! This is pretty lame. The Democratic Party is only one step behind the Republican in its unravelling because it has betrayed its base ever since LBJ. And while practicality has its place, to vote for Hillary before the nomination takes place is just so tepid I can hardly bear it! I don&apos;t blame younger folks for saying "Bernie or no one!" Emotionally, I agree, but I don&apos;t go that far, I&apos;ve held my nose to vote Democratic in just about every election since 1964, and no doubt I&apos;ll do it again if Hillary is the nominee. But to throw in the towel before all the primary votes are in is strange reasoning from a &apos;60s radical. Sounds more like the view of a former &apos;60s radical, which, in my observation, is the place where many of those &apos;60s radicals have lived since they (unfortunately) grew up and began participating aggressively in an economy they could not easily change. So, instead, they joined it, telling themselves they could do more in the system with money than without. That may well be, but "the Revolution" lost all meaning when that happened. Bernie at least articulates what was lost when the baby boomers cut their hair and got good jobs in the system they could not change so easily as they&apos;d hoped and, over time, even seemingly forgot why they&apos;d thought change should happen. I say, "Sorry, Tom, thanks for your service, but you don&apos;t convince me."

As a Latino, your claim to be voting for Hillary out of some debt to us is beyond insulting. I&apos;m sure that is not your intent but that is how it makes me feel. Insulted and upset.
Do you not know what hell Hillary brought to Honduras? How she callously said the children fleeing from the violence the coup brought forward should be deported? How Berta Caceres called her out before her death for destroying Honduras? How she glowingly speaks about and bragged about her support from the odious Henry Kissinger? A man who was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Latin Americans and millions of Asians in Cambodia and Laos? I try to use my words very carefully, but Hillary is NO friend of Latin America or of Latinos. She even had the temerity to redbait Sanders on the Sandinistas and the great Fidel Castro. To Latin Americans Fidel, for all his faults of which there are many, represented the desire to be free of imperial control. The Sandinistas did so much great work from literacy to public health and for someone to take the side of Reagan? It&apos;s absolutely disgusting. You should seriously reconsider what you have said.

Deat Tom, I can understand why you may have cold feet about Bernie. Too many details must be fleshed out over time and Hillary&apos;s return to her original impulses, pushed by Bernie, may be encouraging. To take one example of how unscary Bernie&apos;s policies may be, his fix for Obamacare could be simply to add back the Public Option, i.e., Medicare for whoever chooses it over any private plan, which would greatly expand the "Network" of providers over any other Plan, not to mentiion cut costs with its more far-reaching economies of size. And it&apos;s only about INSURANCE, not socialized medical practitioners and providers, as other systems may have. The "radical" changes will have to be more like readjustments to an out-of-wack system. Fear not. If Hillary wins, she should only be allowed to do so by the slimmest possible delegate count. Stick to Bernie to guide her.

Any refutation of this lengthy rehash of Clintonian talking points is totally unnecessary as it has already been done many, many times already. However, I am deeply thankful to you for reminding us of that wonderful quote from the young Ms Rodham: â[the] prevailing acquisitive and competitive corporate life is not the way of life for us." I nearly died laughing. All I can say is, thanks for disproving your point so eloquently.

Your fantasy of evolutionary change by Hillary, a person driven mostly by ambition and greed, who has only seen some progressive light because of Bernie, who feels entitled to the nomination because....well just because...dare I say because she is a woman. I do not want another token and passive president which will surround itself with the same turnstile establishment advisers and functionaries. She is not trustworthy, has no integrity, no real moral compass and she will only further cuddle up to and entrench the establishment. As Shirley Chisholm (who was truly worthy of being the first woman president) would say, "She has been bought and paid forâ,â¦ and will say whatever we want to hear, but will ultimately do the bidding of her Wall Street and Corporate masters, including foreign entities such as Israel (Netanyahu), Saudi Arabia and many other right wing and oppressive regimes that are in the same cabal as Wall Street and multi-national Corporations (the Military/Industrial Complex in particular). You have solidified my intention to never again support the establishment candidates.  
Just look at Florida Senate race as a concrete example. Obama and the Democratic establishment are supporting Patrick Murphy (a former Republican) instead of Alan Grayson (a stalwart and true progressive). The (lame duck and first African-American president) man of CHANGE, is rejecting change and supporting/promoting the oligarchy. The man who promised change, but instead surrounded himself with Wall Street and Corporate insider advisers when facing the meltdown caused by those same greedy bastards. All kinds of Changes are in the air, but instead of fighting bad change with good change, you want us to fight it with the entrenched and money drenched candidate whoâs husband dragged the Democratic party to the right and helped cause the said meltdown and other bad policies, just to get elected. Tom, you betray yourself! I am willing to wait for Elizabeth Warren in 2020, because Bernie would gladly yield the reigns to a person of integrity and good judgement truly worthy and deserving of being the FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.

Are we sure Alan Grayson, the hedge fund operator, is better than Patrick Murphy?  I love Mr. Grayson&apos;s smart support for Bernie, but I still have questions.

Elizabeth Warren would be fine.  If we are looking for a dynastic succession from one spouse to the other, as the Clintons are attempting, we could do worse than Michelle Obama.

Well, Tom, I respect that you can vote for whom you want. The primary in Tennessee has already been held, so I&apos;ve already voted. My biggest concern about Hillary is that she won&apos;t let us hear or read what she has told the investment houses and the big banks. They didn&apos;t pay her all that money to be told they were jerks and that she would go for the jugular if elected. The meltdown in 2008 was paid for by the middle class and below and only one person has gone to jail. Since then we&apos;ve seen the banks continue on their schemes (LIBOR). They are trying to gut Dodd-Frank. Elizabeth Warren is ringing the alarm bell, but Hillary is tone deaf on this. If she wins the nomination and the election, I fear that we can expect more of the same. On the other hand, if Bernie wins the nomination or can force Hillary to support the changes needed, should she win, then our belief in and support for Bernie is worth it. I fully realize that if Trump, Cruz, Ryan, or any Republican wins the White House and has the House and Senate majorities, the country (and the world) is screwed, but I am going to support and vote for the candidates whom I think "get it" and will fight for it.

Disappointing article.  How does anyone imagine Hillary will fare against an "all out" Republican media assault, seeing as she has never faced one either, being handed a sweetheart seat in the Senate as a Dem Senator from NY (hardly any kind of contest), and then handed the State Department (where her behavior is now the subject of an FBI investigation with coming indictments).  How on earth can a candidate with so much baggage, some of it groundless, but a great deal of it very, very serious, and very much a betrayal of everything the Democrats have stood for since FDR, survive such a "full on" assault?  Even a very large number of Democrats don&apos;t like her.  What about the independents and Republicans.   She will never be President, regardless of what kind of clown the GOP puts forward, and anyone who believes that&apos;s a possibility is delusional and has forgotten the 90s.
It&apos;s really "good riddance" time for the benefit of the party and the country.

What a bunch of crap! Everything he says about Clinton is negative except that she campaigned better in areas with a lot of people of color.  Not that she actually did anything or that her policies would even out our disparities of wealth, but that she campaigned better.  He also takes the lame tack of "we can&apos;t get single payer in a penstroke, so why vote for the guy who is in favor of it."  Of course Sanders isn&apos;t going to sign a repeal of the ACA.  He has just pointed out its glaring inadequacies, like leaving 33M people with no coverage still, and preserving the profit prerogatives of the insurance industry.  I&apos;m disgusted.

Congressional Black Caucus did NOT endorse Clinton: http://m.democracynow.org/stories/15953

Therefore, one of your prime reasons for supporting Clinton does not exist. Why don&apos;t you have a talk with Rep. Keith Ellison, member of the CBC.

Yep, thought the same thing.

Keith Ellison might not have supported her but the rest of the CBC did, this is a fact. End of story.

Precisely.  It was the CBC&apos;s SuperPAC.

Someone should also send him a copy of "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness Book" by Michelle Alexander

Very disappointing article from someone with a long history of "revolutionary" thought and activity. To settle for status-quo Hillary because Bernie&apos;s ideas will be very hard to implement (though Hayden agrees with all of them) is a cop-out. "Revolutions" don&apos;t happen over night. Bernie is taking the first step. Hillary&apos;s approach (and now Hayden&apos;s) is: it can&apos;t be done. Worse, Hayden grants Hillary is a military hawk, but prefers her in the White House to Bernie. On the race issue, Hayden has bought the narrative that Bernie is ignoring race or not trying hard enough to sway minorities. Nonsense. Bernie, as he must know, has been in the streets and in political life since the 60s fighting for civil and human rights. The problem: Sanders is not known by many in the minority community - a big hill to climb in a short time.  Not to mention the lasting harm the Clinton administration, vigorously supported by Hillary, did to blacks and other minority communities - mass incarceration policies, 3 strikes law, welfare "reform," gutting of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, serious cuts to education, NAFTA, end of Glass-Stegall regulations that directly led to the great recession of 2008, and more.

Sanders - who by the way I will in fact vote for - has a campaign structure at the center of which is a crew of white men. Not talking about the black and brown folks that have gathered to his campaign, but rather those making the key decisions at the center of his campaign. That&apos;s real, and it is reflective of "white blind spot" still in our midst in spite of all the decades of struggle, and all of the demographic shift in this country.

His spokesperson is a black woman - Nina Turner.

To me the most important consideration is the Supreme Court. I don&apos;t care if Sanders or Clinton appoints the next justice, I just don&apos;t want Trump or Cruz or Ryan appointing the next justice (or two).

Tom:  After your long complex analysis of all the uncertainties in supporting Bernie over Hillary (or vice versa) only one thing was missing that the younger Tom Hayden would have embraced--courage; the courage to call on people to support and join a program for real structural change.  The younger Tom Hayden would have written a detailed and careful analysis about why it is necessary for people to join together and support Bernie and then create the organizations and movement to push him and those in Congress to get move his program.  He would have written about how all the public organizations, Greenpeace, etc., could join in.  He could have written about the need for a grass roots labor movement that rebuilds workers organizations.  He would have discussed the need for organizations to combat economic inequality and support equal rights for women and people of color.  He would have discussed the need for restarting the peace movement to support the Palestinians and prevent Bernie jumping into another war.

Instead Tom, your weighing of pros and cons that may or may not happen resulted in--emptiness.  A tired leader no longer willing to take chances.

One of my heroes has defected. I am betrayed. I was in Chicago with you in 1968, although not to anywhere near the extent you were. I was enchanted by the possibilities that you represented. I am still enchanted by the possibilities, but those represented by Bernie Sanders. I have not lost mine. Sadly you have lost yours.

Yea so you&apos;re an old dem sell out. There is a surprise here?

I think when you state that you believed Bernie was someone who could move Hillary to the left, that you were never fully in Bernie&apos;s camp.  You were always a Hillary supporter, just one that hoped she&apos;d move more towards Bernie&apos;s platform.  That&apos;s cool, just don&apos;t write a piece about what a big shift it is for you to migrate to Hillary.

Exactly my thought when reading the essay, that the author was from the start a Hillary supporter who considers Bernie Sanders to be merely a message candidate, not a serious vote-getting candidate.

To say that your number 1 reason revolves around the the diversity supporting Hillary is not factual.  If more people in the South knew Bernie&apos;s message then they most definitely would have vote for him.  He gets no love by the mass media, and even less so 2 months ago.  That is changing.  So if his support starts coming from minorities will you then change your mind??  As for another pessimist putting down the "political revolution"  Bernie asks for....are we just content with more closed door politics?  Obama called for change then shut the door when he got in the White House.  Bernie&apos;s engaging people way beyond what Hillary has done.  A political revolution is about the people keeping their elected officials accountable and bringing about big shifts in what our country needs together.  Yes it is not easy and yes it will take more then 4 years, but how long are you willing to wait?  Do you have kids?  If Hillary wins what you will we see there?  Lock the door and the elites making decisions for us.  Therefore inequality expanding and anger/protesting ensuing.  It&apos;s too late to keep arguing that our government shouldn&apos;t be cozy with corporations.  To see that this fact alone doesn&apos;t overcome the decision of so many is frankly disappointing.

Well it seems you&apos;ve changed your mind at least twice:


http://tomhayden.com/home/hillary-clinton-in-2016.html

This column is even less convincing than your 2012 piece.


Marching in the streets did not stop the Iraq war... the drone wars rage on, and the USA is flouting its legal obligation to prosecute torture.

It&apos;s diffult to see how your vote is going to change any of that.

Hayden&apos;s reasons are so lame it almost makes me think someone from the Clinton campaign wrote it?

Hayden writes of prevailing against Republicans in November, "It will take a thorough process of conflict resolution to get there, not a unilateral power wielding by the usual operatives." Does he not realize that it is the Clintons and their corporate overlords who are "the usual operatives"? Also astonishing is that nowhere does he address the issue of whether Hillary can even beat any of the Republicans: as of aggregated polls this week, she only beats Trump, and by a far narrower margin than Bernie. Why are so many Democrats so eager to usher a can&apos;t-win candidate into the general?

Precisely!

The whole"work within the system" ethic is at the core of the problem. It merely props up the very thing that is wrong. I prefer a candidate who will try and fail to one who won&apos;t move the needle. At the Left-Right negotiating table, DLC Democrats ALREADY stake their positions to the right of center. What Progressives want is a candidate who will negotiate for the left FROM the left. Otherwise most of the battle is lost BEFORE it is begun.

First of all, Hayden&apos;s argument is confusing.  It&apos;s like:  here are the great things about Bernie, but I&apos;m voting for Hillary because she still wants to work within the system.  ï»¿He says, "Bernie comes from a place that is familiar to me, the New York culture of democratic socialism. From the Port Huron Statement forward, I have believed in the democratic public control of resources and protecting the rights of labor."  But then he disrespects those ideals by saying that we have to continue fracking.  Fracking is driving climate change more than any other mode of energy production.  How can we transition to a clean energy future now?  By acting now.  Subsidizing all the great research and production of solar and wind and batteries.  The "system" is what has gotten us to this point, and it sure the hell isn&apos;t going to save us!

He&apos;s just trying to manipulate Bernie supporters into voting for Hillary by posing as a former ally. It&apos;s classic concern trolling.

As one of Tom Hayden&apos;s U Michigan SDS comrades from the 1960s, I find his position weak and disappointing.  On race, Bernie was involved in the civil rights movement early on.  The current overwhelming support from blacks for Hillary is difficult for me to understand, given what the Clintons did in the 1990s to enable mass incarceration and gut the welfare system. Sure Bernie&apos;s platform may be unrealistic, but it is a hell of a lot closer to the Port Huron statement than that of Ms. Hillary.   It is about time for democratic socialism to come out of the closet in this country and Bernie is a good person to accomplish that goal.

At long last an article at the Nation that does not glosses over what Bernie Sanders can supposedly do with the "revolution" but offers real and pragmatic arguments what is at stake with the 2016 election and the democratic intra-fighting. And I am afraid already the majority of the comments to this article confirm Tom Hayden&apos;s worst fears about the state of the progressive movement and what it might do to itself in its search for ideological purity.

It just takes a bit of digging to ferret out the real agendas of those opposing Bernie. I see on your Facebook page that you recommend the article by Katha Pollitt in which she argues that Latinos vote for Latino candidates, Blacks vote for black candidates, so "why should women be any different?" I&apos;ll tell you why Anna, it&apos;s because it&apos;s sexist.

Hi Tom.  I thought the purpose of the primaries was to find out which candidate people liked best, not the one they thought had the best chance of winning.  Of course Hillary has the best chance of winning if she has the entire MSM and all the politicians and corporations in the world behind her.  That&apos;s not a strike against Bernie; it&apos;s an indication of how thoroughly corrupt and bought-off our politicians and media are.  The Establishment has been screwing us (and not only us but the rest of the world too) all our lives, and more Establishment will be no different from what we&apos;ve had all these years and decades  since FDR, but with a little tinkering around the edges, maybe, and a lot of happy talk about "empowerment" and "tearing down barriers".  Remember how enthusiastic everybody was in 2008 about Obama?  People thought that once elected, he would stand up for ordinary people, he would fight for what he said he believed in.  None of that happened.  Bernie is not like that, he will fight, he always has.  Anyway, this is not an ordinary election year, the very fate of the planet hangs in the balance, tinkering and triangulation won&apos;t save us (the people and creatures of the Earth); the USA needs a total do-over.  Sure, Bernie will have opposition in Congress and everywhere else, and so will Hillary,  but Bernie will make a lot of noise, and everybody knows he&apos;s right and millions of people will fight with him.  This is a unique opportunity in our lifetimes and very likely our last chance.  Let&apos;s vote in the primaries for the one we believe in and save the traditional nose-holding for the general election.

Your friend and one-time cellmate,

Frank da Cruz
Bronx NY

"ï»¿ Sure, Bernie will have opposition in Congress and everywhere else, and so will Hillary, but Bernie will make a lot of noise, and everybody knows he&apos;s right and millions of people will fight with him. " Exactly, which is why one of his mottos is US not ME. Unlike Obama, who challenged us to &apos;make him do the right thing,&apos; Bernie will challenge us to stay involved and help him do the right thing. I am for Bernie.

These are very week excuses.  As Bernie continues to gain momentum, his candidacy gets wider exposure and his message and policies gain traction.  This is especially true among people of color.  Hillary continues to court the special interests of fossil fuels, the military-corporatist complex, big pharma, Wall Street and others whose interests are not intrinsically progressive.  Her incrementalist, comprimising attitude, combined with her neo-con militarism and neo-lib economics means she will sell out the progressive and independent minded among us  She will be a disaster in a general election because she will triangular to the right, selling out the "revolution", and should she win, her appointments will be the usual hacks of the "Deep State" (Michael Lofgren&apos;s excellent work, which should be required reading for everyone interested in the popularity of both Sanders & Trump).  Tom Hayden, you should know better!  Recent wins for $15 per hour in CA & NY mean that Bernie&apos;s ideas are catching on.  This is a revolutionary, democratic, independent movement of tremendous significance.  I am disappointed to see you opt out for a corrupt party establishment.

Sorry for the bad spellchecker!

Sorry, Tom  -- I&apos;ve been with you over the years. But I don&apos;t recognize either the version of Sanders or the version of Clinton painted here.
When you say "The populist clarity of Bernieâs proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. "
That statement appears to be describing itself rather than the complexity of Sanders&apos; position, sorry.
It&apos;s disappointing to read that, essentially, we should vote for Clinton because of an underlying inertia on the part of the entrenched party elite.
Guess I&apos;d rather keep on trying for something better even if it means not "winning" this time around. 
And I wonder if some of the members of the "elite" are as immune to political change as assumed here. 
How long can the underlying forces that propel Sanders and his ilk (Kshama Sawant, Alan Grayson, to name but a few) not register on the radar of the DC power bosses?
Finally, Clinton&apos;s foreign policy and trade records is atrocious. The sell out of Aristide in Haiti, Zelaya in Honduras, and on and on and on, just can&apos;t be ignored.
Sorry, Tom

Just careful with Grayson. He may be one just hanging on coattails. Do your research before supporting him. Look into others in the Bernie camp - Donna Edwards and Tim Canova, who are more above board.

Donna Edwards and Tim Canova are giants in key races.  They need all the support we can give them.

I&apos;m not convinced that Hillary can win in November; so many people don&apos;t trust her at all. To achieve Bernie&apos;s goal, the country needs faith that political success can be achieved with support from the people instead of corporations. Otherwise, how will we ever elect those willing to bring the change we need?

What better way to show your commitment to people of color than to vote for the family that gave us:  1) the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that hurt millions of poor children and hundreds of thousands of LEGAL immigrants; 2) the 1994 crime bill that resulted in massive incarceration, decimated minority communities and put many young NONVIOLENT offenders in jail for lengthy sentences, stigmatizing them permanently. Your "one reason" for voting for Clinton is because OTHERS are supporting her. It is remarkable that you identify nothing in her RECORD as a reason to vote for her and, indeed, that record has proven to be destructive to the very communities you want to help. It is only that OTHERS are voting for that causes you to vote for her. Man, THAT is not the Tom Hayden that I remember. And the Tom Hayden that I remember would NEVER in a million years vote for a candidate who embraced the war criminal Kissinger as a friend and adviser when she was Sec&apos;y of State.
I wish you a speedy and total recovery from your stroke, Mr. Hayden. Thank you and G-d bless you.

He obviously has financial ties to the Clinton campaign. Money talks.

As a woman of (just barely) over 50, I&apos;m continually incensed at the message that I should vote for Hillary simply because she&apos;s a woman. To do that flies in the face of the entire point of gender equality, in my opinion. Strange to hear Tom Hayden repeating the party line of so many over-50 Democratic women: he&apos;s voting for her because he wants to have a woman president. Well, so do I, but not THAT woman. Give me Elizabeth Warren and you&apos;ll have my vote, but in this race? It&apos;s #BernieOrBust.

race??????  Look, many of those who are black supporters of Hillary are so because they are relatively recent entrants into the old boy democratic party politicking....they do not want to lose their connections to the establishment that are in historical terms very recent. But, Sanders is sensitive and aware and astute and would pay attention to concern of exclusion while transforming the nature of the democratic party process which for too long has been equivalent to that of the Republicans in that they are both supporters of Corporate growth and privileges....AND, on an ethical level...I feel embarrassed about your position that you would despite your favoring of Sander&apos;s positions and saying that you are a supporter of the Occupy movement, that you would follow support Clinton because she has the support of SOME people of color in the Democratic Party Process...That simply feels like a moral cop out.

Do you really think anything short of a political revolution is going to significantly change things?  Are you really voting for Hillary because she is a woman and appears more committed to the groups you identify with without regard to the underlying problem of wealth and income inequity?  Do you really think that Hillary is going to turn her backs on her wealthy supporters to change the role of money in politics?  I am sorry to see you abandon the future of our children by supporting a candidate who will not challenge corporate interests to work for real action on climate change.

Hayden supports Clinton as the safe choice - more likely to survive a Republican onslaught, more practiced at negotiating incremental change. But that requires a belief that Republicans will compromise and act in the best interest of America - something that didn&apos;t happen despite Obama winning the presidency with impressive margins.   Why does Sanders poll better against Trump and Cruz than Clinton? Because he taps into the same anger and frustration with the political establishment. The Democrats&apos; challenge is to convince those angry voters that a "socialist" government that prioritizes their needs, instead of genuflecting to global corporations and the business elite, is worth fighting for - not just at election time, but every day. A democracy requires constant citizen involvement. Even if Clinton wins, she will need a loud public to support her efforts. I think that Sanders has been better at motivating that passion for meaningful change.

Hillary is "ï»¿more practiced at negotiating incremental change"  Really?  What incremental change has Hillary successfully negotiated?  Bernie has plenty.

Exactly right! Faced with a Republican majority, Hillary will "get things done" by aligning with those Republicans - like Bill did in the 90s.

" I have been so tied to the womenâs movement that I cannot imagine scoffing at the chance to vote for a woman president."  How about you imagine voting for a woman who DESERVES to be president, not simply the first woman with a real shot at it? If Fiorina would have somehow been the GOP frontrunner and Hillary was not in the race, does that mean you&apos;d vote for the female uber alles?  not a very egalitarian position, if the only thing that matters to you is what your peers are doing and what chromosome composition the candidate has.

I would think that a long-time peace activist would be more troubled than he indicates in this piece about the fact that HC&apos;s foreign policy tendencies (war, intervention, regime change) have been hawkish enough to  draw the praise of the likes of Dick Cheney, Henry Kissinger, and Robert Kagan

I was hopeful that Hayden might provide a surer rationale for supporting Clinton. I am profoundly ambivalent, having my Sanders support deeply eroded by his NY Post editorial board interview.  Instead, we get the typical Hayden -- self-involved and self-justifying.

Please take a minute to watch The Young Turks&apos; examination of the NYDN piece. I&apos;ve watched/read differing viewpoints, as well as reading the transcript in its entirety, and I have come to conclusion that their single goal was to swift boat and disqualify him: strangely, exactly what was leaked that the Clinton campaign would do just days before.

Erin, I implore you to read the transcript of the ENTIRE interview. It&apos;s clear that Bernie Sanders knows exactly what he&apos;s talking about, while the people interviewing him are the ones who are confused about the facts of how banking regulatory processes work. Please don&apos;t keep repeating the corporate media line without doing the research yourself! The words "I don&apos;t know" did pass Sanders&apos; lips, but more in the sense of how you reply to someone who says something completely wrong, yet you don&apos;t want to insult them by saying so. Like "I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d agree that Justin Bieber has musical talent...but he sure does sell a lot of records!"

I have read the interview transcript and it highlights the very differences between Clinton & Sanders that give me pause -- Clinton&apos;s wonky, too-practiced responses vs. Sanders&apos; from the gut, philosophical ones. For someone making banks the major -- legitimate -- target of his reform plan, he should know more about his vision for post-break up banks&apos; profile. His discussion of the settlements in Israel are most welcome, but if he is taking that particular case on, he should be able to cite why they are illegal.

Sorry, I have to question your claim to have read the transcript, since you couldn&apos;t even correctly identify which newspaper it appeared in.

Sorry, since the Post stopped afternoon publication decades ago, I often conflate the two NYC tabloids. Interestingly, when I googled the transcript, I used NY "Post" & it took two pages before I got the transcript, but I did, indeed get & read it. My comments reflect that.

Not even plausible.  If you read the transcript, you will see that each question is headlined with "Daily News" in bold type, followed by the response, headed "Sanders," in bold type. 

You can&apos;t have read it very carefully.

I simply don&apos;t understand why people keep hammering this issue even when pointed to the transcript. And even after claiming to have read it! Either they&apos;re lying about having read it, or they have serious reading comprehension issues. It&apos;s right there!

This is disappointing.  Your arguments donÂ´t hold water.

I respect this as a statement of resignation.  But, as ever, it is hope for the future that is in order.

I sense an asymmetry between supporters of Bernie and Hillary.  Supporters of Hillary, like myself, are pretty united in saying "of course we&apos;ll support Bernie if he is nominated!"  I don&apos;t sense as much from Bernie supporters.  In fact, their negativism is beginning to bother and worry me.

David, do you really believe Bernie&apos;s supporters will not get out and vote for Hillary over Trump or Cruz if it comes to that?

You are right and you should be worried. Hillary supporters don&apos;t have a blind spot for the fact that a lot of people outside of her supporters see her as a fundamentally flawed candidate, and a clear representation of what they believe is wrong with American politics. It isn&apos;t merely a disagreement about a couple of policies, but rather a distrust and genuine dislike for her style of governance and the system that she represents. Bernie supporters might agree that Hillary may be "able to get things done," but they aren&apos;t interested in "Hillary things," and are apprehensive about paying the "Hillary price" to get them. To a lot of Bernie supporters the choice between Hillary and the republican nominee is barely a choice, and possibly not one worth even making.

This is what happens when you get all your news from the New York Times. "One simple reason"? I didn&apos;t hear it, and I&apos;m a close reader. I am not swayed, I am not convinced. Bernie or bust!

His simple reason was - -  race?

Yeah, even though this Latina was a Bernie supporter before he even announced his run. Even though, here in reds-state Arizona, his rallies were packed to the brim with black, white, Asian, First Nation, Latino, old, young, very old, very young, middle-aged, gay, straight, cisgender, transgender, ALL KINDS. 

Bernie doesn&apos;t have a "diversity" problem. He has a "media" problem. They will repeat and regurgitate the most tired of narratives in order to aid the Clinton campaign. She&apos;s losing support from nearly all demographics cataclysmically. I&apos;d love to have a system where folks have to preface every article or news show with how much they&apos;ve received as a "donation" and from who, it would be interesting whether the Clinton campaign used a carrot or a stick to make sure that Tom fell in line.

"ï»¿ For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that âpolitical revolutionâ will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic. "

As is this one observation, among others. Bernie said he would build on, not destroy the ACA.

I read with avid interest Mr. Hayden&apos;s tribute to the socialist democratic movement. But, I think the consensus is that, if Bernie loses, the movement will still live on. In the person of Elizabeth Warren. Who says that change can&apos;t come from the Foggy Bottom inside?
aures lupi

Establishment: 1, The Nation: 0

Mr. Hayden has not explained why a vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary would somehow constitute a "betrayal" of non-white constituents. Is he not aware of Bernie&apos;s recent rallies in the Bronx, Washington Heights, Brooklyn, Queens and Harlem? I have seen overwhelming numbers of people of color at these events. Furthermore, is he aware that Bernie Sanders secured significant proportions of the Native American vote in States like Alaska and Wisconsin, and that he cleaned up in Hawaii, perhaps the nation&apos;s single most racially diverse state? I find this to be a singularly unconvincing reason not to vote for him, especially given Mr. Hayden&apos;s extensive praise of Bernie&apos;s record on issues of environmental concern and economic and social justice. I suspect that a more likely reason for Hayden&apos;s switch to Hillary is good old-fashioned fear of being on the Clinton Hit List, as the Clinton&apos;s are well known to hold grudges and take future reprisals against those who don&apos;t support them electorally. This would also help explain her "overwhelming" number of mainstream political endorsements. Fortunately though, the American people need not fear personal vengeance from the Clintons in return for voting their true conscience. Be true to your wishes, America! Vote for the candidate that you really want!

Hayden&apos;s argument about his loyalty to "Peoples of Color" has nothing to do with real people of color.

I didn&apos;t bother to read this, to save unnecessary waste of time, but could Tom Hayden&apos;s reason possibly be Bernie&apos;s opposition to capital punishment?

How far have gone over to the Dark Side, Tom. Is Darth Vader your daddy?
