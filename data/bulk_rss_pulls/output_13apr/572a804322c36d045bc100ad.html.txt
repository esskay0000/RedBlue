Itâs not his focus on the economyâitâs that he doesnât seem to understand that the economy is structured by gender and race.

I almost voted for Bernie Sanders. After all, in important ways his politics are closer to mine than Hillary Clintonâs are, and his campaign for the White House is inspiring. So why not put my tiny grain of sand on his side of the scale in the primary? Unfortunately for electoral democracy, I neglected to read the instructions on my absentee ballot, which clearly stated that it had to be postmarked the day before the actual primary, and thus missed my chance to vote. In the end, I marked my ballot for Hillary and mailed it anyway, figuring New York Cityâs Board of Elections is so dysfunctional that maybe they would count it by mistake.

							Bernie is a traditional leftist for whom feminism is a distraction.
						
 
Why didnât Bernie get me? Well, thereâs electability: I just donât believe Americans are ready for a 74-year-old self-described socialist with a long far-left CV who would raise their taxes by quite a lot. By the time the Republicans got finished with him, heâd be the love child of Rosa Luxemburg and the Ayatollah Khomeini, and then itâs hello, President Trump. Thereâs the question, too, of how much Bernie could actually accomplish. Would he make an effective president, as I think Hillary willâall the more so now that sheâs been forced to see that a significant part of the Democratic electorate is to her left?				
					
					
Part of the answer is simpler, though: Bernie didnât ask for my vote. Oh, you can go to his website and find a page of boilerplate setting out his general commitments to womenâs rights: Heâs in favor of equal pay, reproductive rights, the ERA, the Violence Against Women Act, childcare for all, and so onâa laundry list, indeed, of the causes dear to the heart of those often derided by his supporters as bourgeois feminists content with incremental change. I am aware, too, that Bernie has a good voting record on those issues in Congress. But thereâs a difference between someone who votes the right way, and someone who introduces legislation and champions the issue. He never convinced me that gender issues, specifically the persistent subordination of women in every area of life, were of much concern to him. There were all those little tells. Pooh-poohing Planned Parenthood and NARAL as âestablishmentâ when he didnât get their endorsement. Arguing for parental leave because it allows a new mother âto stay home and bond with her babyâ instead of as something that benefits fathers as well, and something that women need in order to work and advance on the job. Doubling down on the idiotic quip by his surrogate, Killer Mike (âA uterus doesnât qualify you to be president of the United Statesâ), with the pseudo-lofty pledge âNo one has ever heard me say, âHey guys, letâs stand together, vote for a man.â I would never do that, never have.â Is there a word for someone whose entitlement is so vast, so deep, so historically embedded, and so unconscious it includes the belief that they got where they are by a resolute devotion to fair play? Itâs not reassuring that his senior campaign staff, like his long-time political inner circle, is almost entirely white and male.

In a long campaign, everyone says unfortunate things. But these and other remarks suggest that when it comes to gender, he just doesnât feel the burn. The problem is less that Bernie focuses on class and economic inequality than that he doesnât seem to understand that the economy, like society generally, is structured by gender and race. Equal pay is great, but if women and men are funneled into different kinds of work by race and gender, with menâs jobs valued more because men are valued more, and if women are hobbled economically by doing most of the domestic labor and having to contend with prejudice against working mothers to boot, equal pay alone doesnât solve the problem. It would have been great if Bernie had given a major speech about his plans to make womenâs lives betterâsafer, fairer, less dominated by men. Instead, he gives every sign of believing that his basic programâa $15 minimum wage, free public college, breaking up the big banks, single-payer health insuranceâis quite enough. Those are all great and important goalsâin fact, the $15 minimum wage will benefit more women than men. But they do not speak directly to the rage and fed-upness that so many women, in every class, justly feel. Bernie showed a similar blindness to the specific harms of racism, but, thanks largely to Black Lives Matter, has moved a little further toward integrating race into his analysis.

At 74, you are who you are. Bernie is a traditional class-based leftist for whom feminism is a distraction. Abortion, as he told Rolling Stone, is a âsocial issue.â Womenâs mental and physical health, their economic survival, their ability to determine the shape of their own lives as men do, is a social issue? The clear implication is that reproductive rights (like guns and LGBT rights, which he mentions in the same breath) are secondary considerations, impediments to winning broad support for his populist economic proposals. I can go to the comment sections of AlterNetâor The Nationâand get that view any day from the bros, but I really thought weâd be further along with a white man who wants to lead a movement in a party that is majority female and over a third people of color.				
					
					
After Indiana, the GOP looks more likely than ever to nominate a racist, xenophobic misogynist of staggering crudeness and mendacity. If elected, Trump would consult with the conservative Heritage Foundation on Supreme Court nominations. We could well lose what remains of a century of progress for women, workers, LGBT people, and people of color, including the right to vote itself.				
					
					
Trump understands very well that racism and sexism are crucial components of the nationalistic insurgence he wants to lead; he appeals openly to some of the darkest impulses in our political id. It is more than disturbing that Bernie pays so little attention to these dangers. Heâs changed the debate within the Democratic Party by showing that millions of voters want more than incremental, technocratic tinkering with growing inequality. For that, Iâm grateful. But when it comes to dealing with the Republicans in November, I donât think Bernie gets the awful reality weâre facing. Hillary does.

So it matters more to Pollitt that Sanders understand the economy in precisely the same way she does (even though she can&apos;t possibly know the depth of his understanding from a campaign), than what he will do with the understanding he does have...which is continue his forty year fight for economic justice FOR ALL.  And Hillary got Pollitt&apos;s vote because she has the proper understanding of the economy, even though she always has and will continue to ignore it to justify acting on behalf of the economic elites who fund her campaigns and her husband&apos;s "charity".  That&apos;s perverse, and a huge disservice to 99% of the country.

I&apos;m a 67 year old white, male who has backed Bernie and supports his taking this to the convention.  Katha raises fair points  on gender and race as central concerns.  It&apos;s a debate the left needs to continue. And, Bernie did us a real service by running.
Prior to this primary, Hillary was on track to bring back the 90s, complete with Bob Rubin and company setting economic policy and vetoing heterodox economic advisers.  It will be tougher to do that now.
With that said, Bernie isn&apos;t going to be the nominee.  We need to be clear that we&apos;re uniting to defeat Trump.  People have been searching for electoral parallels.  Bob Ross, writing in the American Prospect, suggests that 1932 Germany is a close enough comparison.  We can&apos;t have progressives saying "after Trump, us."

Thank you, Katha Pollitt for one of the best observational assessments of this Democratic primary race. I respect the devotion of Bernie&apos;s following. He&apos;s my kind of hippie. He just can&apos;t win. And, even if he did, he&apos;s big on vision but governing - not so much. It&apos;s all about revolution. As one who lived the Sixties Revolution (a movement far larger and more diverse), even if you won (which you won&apos;t) the forces of opposition would devour you before August. I&apos;ll go with the Warrior.

Just like Katha, you have no vision or imagination. And like Hillary, you think small. Dreamers make the world go around, and those with big ideas are the ones who truly make things happen.

I notice that Ms. Pollitt never discusses foreign policy differences when touting her favored candidate. Will Ms. Clinton be an "effective president" when she engages in another failed attempt at regime change? Even the NYT, which endorsed Clinton, called her the most hawkish candidate remaining in the race. During her tenure as Secretary of State, she positioned herself to the right of Obama on numerous issues--issues that I used to think Katha Pollitt cared about. Do these foreign-policy misadventures matter only when a Republican administration is calling the shots? 

These ethical blind spots are disappointingly prevalent among Clinton supporters, who want to pretend that they&apos;re leftists while supporting a candidate who surrounds herself with neoconservative foreign policy advisors (many of whom also advise Republicans) and neoliberal economic advisors. 

These same Clinton champions indulge in the rankest of red-baiting (Pollitt, Goldberg), all the while saying that they&apos;re merely predicting what the Republicans will say in the unlikely event that Sanders becomes the Democratic candidate. This disgraceful rhetoric reminds me of all the HRC dog-whistling in 2008 about Obama&apos;s religion and birthplace, not to mention all the nasty implications about his pastor and other associates. 

Rather than crank out another article bashing Bernie for being too old and set in his ways (those six years he has on Clinton make all the difference, I guess), I&apos;d like Ms. Pollitt to address why she thinks it&apos;s more important for U.S. women to see a female hawk in power than for women in other countries to live in peace and safety. If you ask me, eliding that question, as Clinton&apos;s leftish apologists always seem to do, is the very definition of white privilege.

For what it&apos;s worth, I am a woman, too. I&apos;m also a feminist. For me, feminism means supporting the candidate who is better for *all* women, not just privileged American women.

Katha - your argument is not supported by the best polling data available.  If your most basic desire is the prevention of a Trump presidency, the data makes it clear that Senator Sanders is the way to go.  Please see: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html

yeah, hillary does get "the awful reality weâre facing". ask women killed in honduras by the people hillary put in power. or the victims of her strategies in libya. yeah, she does awrigth. give me a break! she is no better than trump.

Though I disagree with your characterization of Bernie Sanders, I can respect the points which you stressed in your column. There&apos;s an old rock &apos;n rock song from the sixties by Joe South entitled "Walk A Mile In My Shoes." I am sure you are sincere in your objections to Bernie Sanders. And like you, I have specific reservations with Hillary also based upon my gender issues. I had the draft breathing down my neck like a predator solely based upon the fact I was male. But I lucked out, and Uncle Sam made me a medical corpsman after basic training. I was "in the rear with the gear." It&apos;s probably the main reason I&apos;m sitting right here right now writing this comment to you. That&apos;s what&apos;s bothers me so much about Hillary. She&apos;s so hawkish. Our country simply can&apos;t afford another disastrous land war in the Greater Middle East after the debacles in Afghanistan and Iraq. These unnecessary wars are destroying the fabric of our fragile democracy back home. I voted for Bill in his run for the White House because I rejected that GOP smear campaign that he was a "draft dodger" during the sixties. I thought it wa a rhetorical red herring. So I hope you realize even men have gender issues which color their perceptions of candidates. But I must say I enjoyed this column because you were sincere and honest about your quandary. I doubt I will vote for Hillary. I&apos;ll probably sit out this election.

I can&apos;t decide whether I just read a feminist pitching HRC, or a Hillary supporter pitching feminism. Both angles seem bound-at-the-hip. Either way... there&apos;s nothing hidden about her agenda.

This article is terribly disappointing. You finally have a chance to vote for a real progressive and you choose a neoliberal who has initially been on the wrong side of almost every issue I care about. Then, when she finds herself at odds with her constituents, she changes and attacks her opponent with manufactured ire. Yuk.

If they count your vote, you can thank yourself for President Trump.

To suggest that Bernie doesn&apos;t get it is, at best, disingenuous.  He not only gets it -- about poverty, racism, women&apos;s rights, the struggles of the LGBT community, the need for a sane foreign policy, and all the rest -- he gets it enough to know that, against all odds, it mattered that he toss his hat in the ring and take on the most powerful person and family in modern Democratic politics, the one person who was to be crowned uncontested.  Why would he do this?  A lark?  A narcissistic need for attention?  Not quite.  he did it because he knew the person he would be opposing is one who has definitively shown over the years that she doesn&apos;t get it.  You can forgive her Iraq War vote, sure.  You can even forgive the tinkering in Honduras that helped to bring about the death of that country&apos;s foremost proponent of political change, who also happened to be a woman.  You can also forgive her original stand on DOMA, or her support for her husband&apos;s crime bill that effectively eviscerated a generation of mostly young black men, or forgive her support for welfare reform that seemed just fine, until the Great Recession hit and the gaping holes in the social safety net it helped to tear asunder became evident.  You can forgive all this, and more.  But Secretary Clinton has shown little more than her ability to politic like Zelig, appealing to white voters in &apos;08 with race-baiting, but this time, courting the black vote â¦ urging Bernie to step aside almost from the beginning, while in &apos;08 she raised the specter of the RFK&apos;s assassination as her reason for not stepping aside gracefully.  If Ms. Pollitt sees in Secretary Clinton someone she prefers, that, of course, is her prerogative.  but to suggest that she might&apos;ve voted for Bernie if only Bernie &apos;got it&apos;?  â¦  Please.

Are you a mind reader Kathy? Did you ask Bernie if feminsim is a distraction? He is humanist, not focused on identity but the sum of all of us.  Sounds like you are grasping for straws. If that is the reason you did not vote for him, you sound quite shallow.

Much of the debate does revolve around the priorities that any candidate places upon their most important issues. Contrary to Ms. Pollit, Sandersâ analysis is much more in harmony with me. For me, Peace is first, followed by wresting political hegemony in the USA out of the vicegrip of the homegrown plutocracy. But it is not only that Pollit apparently ranks her issues differently than I do. Myopically, paying FAR too much attention to the relatively marginal gender differences between the Democrat candidates, Pollit absolutely fails to comprehend that she grants FAR too much credit to Hillary for pushing her pet complaints. Clintonâs individual legislative accomplishments are microscopic and rhetoric is cheap. While Pollit may nitpick about what Birdie has not been âgung-hoâ enough about for her discriminating tastes, at least he has not stood guard and repeatedly functioned as a political sword and shield for precisely much of âthe awful reality weâre facingâ. Pollit wants to vote for the woman, and she has wasted a column trying to convince me, and herself, that she has made the smart and ethical choice. Go on and vote for the Kissinger clone and fawning plutocratic servant. She is female and thatâs her main attribute for so many feminists. Make your lame rationalization, but donât think that it is well defended or persuasive.

"I almost voted for Bernie Sanders." Seriously? Even though, in past pieces written for The Nation, youâve indicated your intention to vote for HRC (as in "Why Have I (Almost) Always Voted for the Male Candidate?") and have more or less endorsed her candidacy from the onset (as in "Why Iâm Read--and Excited--for Hillary," which was written in early June 2015). Vote for whomever you want, but please spare people the I-used-to-support-Bernie-but... story. Itâs dishonest. Itâs contrived. Itâs transparent. It reeks of pandering. And--on account of all these things--it does nothing to help your cause. Iâm not sure why Clinton surrogates keep pushing this line of reasoning. Make your case for your preferred candidate, fine. But to misrepresent yourself as someone who was seriously contemplating voting for Sanders but thought better of it because of whatever reasonsâ¦? Well, itâs not only a lie, itâs also manipulative and blatantly condescending. And itâs telling that HRC supporters feel the need to resort to this tactic.

It is not what people say but what people actually do. Nothing has done more damage to people of color than the war on drugs begun under Nixon, expanded by Reagan and then made exponentially worse by Bill Clinton with mandatory sentencing that gave black men prison sentences for drug possession that were more severe than that for a white male drunk who kills one or more people. More black men are providing slave labor in today&apos;s prisons than were working as slaves before the Civil War. Black women are harmed when the black men are in prison and later when these men are labeled for life as felons and unable to receive any public assistance or vote or get employment.

Thanks for schoolin&apos; us women folk, Bernie Bro.  Tearing down Bill Clinton&apos;s admin of 20 years ago doesn&apos;t make the case for BS or against HRC.  Donald Trump is a real threat to all that Progressives (including Bernie Bros.) believe and want.  Since HRC is the likely nominee, get over over the 90s and help defeat Trump.

What a wonderful way to persuade people to support your candidate: insult them! 

Do you not realize that many of the people you&apos;re dismissing as "Bernie Bros" are women--women who have given a great deal of thought to the differences between the candidates?

As a Vietnam combat vet who volunteered for service as a Hospital Corpsman with the USMC, as someone who is 67, as someone who has been teaching at the post-secondary level for nearly 40 years, I cannot tell you how ridiculous this notion of Bernie Bros. is, as well as insulting.  Some of prefer substantive examination of the issues to pejorative name-calling.  And if you want to cast your vote based on gender, that is certainly your prerogative.  But if you ever took the time to examine things a bit more closely, you&apos;d notice that, in poll after poll conducted by the more reputable practitioners of that bit of stats, Bernie does better against all Republican comers than HRC does.  In fact, Bernie beats them all, while Hillary loses to Kasich.  It&apos;s precisely because we need our best shot against Trump that makes the case for Bernie, as well as down-ticket candidates who will benefit from the independents and larger voter turnout that Bernie can muster.  ...  As for HRC not having anything to do with Bill&apos;s disastrous policies, perhaps you&apos;re too young to remember how fervently she supported him AND those policies.

Trump is the not the enemy, the Clintons are.

On the other hand, just saying "Donald Trump" doesn&apos;t make a case for HRC.
