If you were a kid growing up in the â80sâmaybe letâs say youâre gay tooâthis is what you first learned about sex: It will kill you. You donât have sex yet; you donât even really know what it is, but you know that it is lethal. That somehow it leads to the men with the skeletal bodies and the blotchy marks on their skin that you see on the television, the men who donât look at the camera and are alone. 
From this certainty, a whole way of being unfolds. The body, especially the naked body, is gross. Penises are gross; tits are gross; lips are kinda gross too. Ewwwww. Clothing becomes a kind of hallowed armor (except lingerie, which is also gross) and should never be removed, especially in the locker room. Whatever curiosity you have about what adults do behind closed doors, or on the cable stations your parents donât subscribe to, is squashed by the notion that sex=death. You stop asking questions. You leave doors closed.
But then, one day on the radio, a song blows those doors open. You donât know who sings it. Or even how many people are singing it, or whether they are boys or girls, or white or black. But the guitar hooks and squeals and pops like nothing else, and a lyric worms its way into your brain and stays there for the next 30 years: 
Yeah, everybodyâs got a bomb
We could all die any day
But before Iâll let that happen,
Iâll dance my life away 
Later, youâll learn that the singer is a wholly improbable creatureâmade of sinew and lace and leather and hairâand that he has a lot of friends, including his band, The Revolution. Youâll learn more explicit lyrics to songs like âDarling Nikkiâ and âHead.â But â1999â will always be what turns you inside out, even when it is played ad nauseam at bars in the year 1999. On one side of your childhood, there is Reagan and AIDS and nuclear war and the yelling Christians. And on the other side, there is Prince.

I will be 70 this year. I have fond memories of buying The Purple Rain Album for my daughter. She was born in 72. We both had so much fun dancing and singing to the songs on that album. RIP Prince.

Thank you, Richard.

Beautiful. I know what you mean. And then again, I can not stop myself from dancing when "Kiss" comes on.

I remember another Prince lyric:
In France, a skinny man died of a big 
disease with a little name.
By chance, his girlfriend
 came across a needle and soon 
she did the same. 
Time. Time.

Pretty well covers some of the bases of the shadow period we in the gay community had to go through.  After not too long, it sure did feel like it was planned, to make us feel negative about sex and who we were.  I&apos;m not "forgiving" the Reagans for anything.  They had every intention of leaving millions in the dark to die.  It was great that Prince was around, as were others who kept the notion of sex as something positive alive.

and then there&apos;s the great promotion of the drug war and shameful interference in Central and South America... oh, yes, and Iran.  What an amazing counterpoint "Saint Reagan" is to the current fact-free zone of the Republican party... his true legacy.
