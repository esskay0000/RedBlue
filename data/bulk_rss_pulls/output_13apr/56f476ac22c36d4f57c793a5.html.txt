Re âDonald Trump Is Dangerousâ [March 14]: Iâve been phone-banking around the country for Bernie SandersâÂ­Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Floridaâand I can tell you that there are Democrats who voted twice for Barack Obama and support Bernie, but who cannot or will not vote for Hillary Clinton. And Iâve also talked to GOP voters who are Trump supporters, some of whom told me that if Trump doesnât get the nomination, they will vote for Sanders. Trumpâs racism may get some votes, as the polls suggest, but his ecoÂ­nomic nationalism is what I think binds his voters to him: They feel screwed, and heâs listening to them.		
Trumpâs campaign reminds me of a famous incident involving Slobodan Milosevic. Early in his drive for power, he went to a coal mine and told the miners that no one was going to beat them up; he wouldnât allow it. The rest is history.

Donald Trump won the election! I swore I saw it on the news. There he was in the Oval Office, sitting at the presidential deskâbut wait, the desk was gold! The rug was gold! In fact, the whole room was gold!		
He was talking to reporters, telling them about all the actions heâs taken to âMake America Great Again.â		
He redecorated the White House: all gold! Congress and the Supreme Court, too. There was also a gold path leading to and connecting all three, and a fence so high around everythingâand yes, it was gold, too.		
He had thrown out the Muslims for being terrorists, the Mexicans for taking jobs, African Americans because they kept on asking for rights, ugly women for being ugly (although Trump boasted that he had started a clinic to help improve their looks), all non-evangelical Christians for attacking Christmas, the Jews for crucifying Christ, and all remaining Democrats for aiding and abetting these groups.		
I looked around: There was The Donald in a glittering white suit, flashing his smile and shaking his head, saying: âSee, I made America great again!â And the reporters, all gold-gun-carrying supporters, took selfies with him.

Recently, thereâs been a spike in Americans Googling âmoving abroad.â Look, I donât blame you. With Trumpâs campaign inspiring racist, hate-filled, and violent chants, America feels like itâs caught in a Twilight Zone episode mirroring Orwellâs 1984. I myself am filled with anxiety about the state of our beloved red, white, and blue, and continue to lose sleep over current happenings. As Americans threaten to abandon our nation, I wonder if Iâm alone in my attempts to return from abroad? Watching American politics unravel before me on British television, Iâve realized this isnât a time to flee; itâs a time to come home.

This isnât some savior complex, but rather a rallying cry: How dare we, as Americans, threaten to let a tyrant and bully like Trump get this far out of hand? Iâve never been ashamed to say Iâm American while living and traveling abroad, but now I say it with guilt. Guilt because weâve allowed America to disgrace itself by letting Trump claim he knows how Americans really behave and feel.		
Iâm proud of my home state of Illinois for recently protesting Trump in Chicago and Bloomington. Witnessing those movements from across the pond filled me with pride and reaffirmed that, while thereâs a lot of labor to be done stateside, there are individuals ready for hard work. America, youâre bruised, but not yet beaten. Letâs put the bottle of hatred down and come together again.

The Real Realistâ©
Your article âBernie Sanders, the Foreign-Policy Realist of 2016â [March 14] reinforces my desire to see him elected as president of the United States of America. As Robert English says, he is actually the most sober and clear-eyed. Bernie is our best hope to avoid a nuclear disaster.

Robert English has written an insightful piece. Hopefully, Bernie Sanders will bring Hillary Clinton further into the ârealistâ camp prior to the November election, following which she will most likely be the next presidentâa beneficiary of near-zero interest rates, better employment numbers, and low inflation.		
At any rate, regarding foreign policy, campaign promises are one matter; how policy plays out once a politician is in office is another matter entirely. If the country is lucky, Sanders might influence the Republicans as well. It is a shame that during the recent [March 10] GOP debate there was almost no critical discussion whatsoever regarding the issue of military expenditures and the present administrationâs âidealistâ foreign- policy approach. Why? Each of the candidates whistled the idealist campâs tune throughout the night. In a sense, this may be the true paradox of modern-day conservatism, as it used to mean avoiding unnecessary foreign entanglements. Itâs a shame that George Kennan had the proper take on what should have been our approach in the postâCold War era, but the beneficiaries of excessive interventionism prevailed and the âpeace dividendââ was lost. Nice article.

A right-on piece! [âPBS Follows the Pack,â March 14]. I quit watching PBS ânewsâ years ago. Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill were clearly drifting off-center and becoming shills for right-wing dogma. Now they are both solidly there, as Eric Alterman clearly demonstrates in his essay.		
Itâs a pathetic situation for our so-called âliberalâ media, but it was gratifying to see a journalist of Altermanâs clout calling these shills out, at last.

I wish that Nan Aron, Kyle C. Barry, and The Nation would substitute the term âselective originalismâ for âoriginalismâ when describing Scaliaâs âphilosophyâ [âSupreme Court Showdown,â March 7]. One need only look to his Second Amendment or war-powers decisions to see that he was perfectly ready to abandon the Constitutionâs âoriginalâ meaning (if, indeed, that term has any purchase at all) to further his political beliefs.

I wish that Nan Aron, Kyle C. Barry, and The Nation would substitute the term âselective originalismâ for âoriginalismâ when describing Scaliaâs âphilosophyâ [âSupreme Court Showdown,â March 7]. One need only look to his Second Amendment or war-powers decisions to see that he was perfectly ready to abandon the Constitutionâs âoriginalâ meaning (if, indeed, that term has any purchase at all) to further his political beliefs.

Donald Trump won the election! I swore I saw it on the news. There he was in the Oval Office, sitting at the presidential deskâbut wait, the desk was gold! The rug was gold! In fact, the whole room was gold!		
He was talking to reporters, telling them about all the actions heâs taken to âMake America Great Again.â		
He redecorated the White House: all gold! Congress and the Supreme Court, too. There was also a gold path leading to and connecting all three, and a fence so high around everythingâand yes, it was gold, too.		
He had thrown out the Muslims for being terrorists, the Mexicans for taking jobs, African Americans because they kept on asking for rights, ugly women for being ugly (although Trump boasted that he had started a clinic to help improve their looks), all non-evangelical Christians for attacking Christmas, the Jews for crucifying Christ, and all remaining Democrats for aiding and abetting these groups.		
I looked around: There was The Donald in a glittering white suit, flashing his smile and shaking his head, saying: âSee, I made America great again!â And the reporters, all gold-gun-carrying supporters, took selfies with him.

Recently, thereâs been a spike in Americans Googling âmoving abroad.â Look, I donât blame you. With Trumpâs campaign inspiring racist, hate-filled, and violent chants, America feels like itâs caught in a Twilight Zone episode mirroring Orwellâs 1984. I myself am filled with anxiety about the state of our beloved red, white, and blue, and continue to lose sleep over current happenings. As Americans threaten to abandon our nation, I wonder if Iâm alone in my attempts to return from abroad? Watching American politics unravel before me on British television, Iâve realized this isnât a time to flee; itâs a time to come home.

This isnât some savior complex, but rather a rallying cry: How dare we, as Americans, threaten to let a tyrant and bully like Trump get this far out of hand? Iâve never been ashamed to say Iâm American while living and traveling abroad, but now I say it with guilt. Guilt because weâve allowed America to disgrace itself by letting Trump claim he knows how Americans really behave and feel.		
Iâm proud of my home state of Illinois for recently protesting Trump in Chicago and Bloomington. Witnessing those movements from across the pond filled me with pride and reaffirmed that, while thereâs a lot of labor to be done stateside, there are individuals ready for hard work. America, youâre bruised, but not yet beaten. Letâs put the bottle of hatred down and come together again.

The Real Realistâ©
Your article âBernie Sanders, the Foreign-Policy Realist of 2016â [March 14] reinforces my desire to see him elected as president of the United States of America. As Robert English says, he is actually the most sober and clear-eyed. Bernie is our best hope to avoid a nuclear disaster.

Robert English has written an insightful piece. Hopefully, Bernie Sanders will bring Hillary Clinton further into the ârealistâ camp prior to the November election, following which she will most likely be the next presidentâa beneficiary of near-zero interest rates, better employment numbers, and low inflation.		
At any rate, regarding foreign policy, campaign promises are one matter; how policy plays out once a politician is in office is another matter entirely. If the country is lucky, Sanders might influence the Republicans as well. It is a shame that during the recent [March 10] GOP debate there was almost no critical discussion whatsoever regarding the issue of military expenditures and the present administrationâs âidealistâ foreign- policy approach. Why? Each of the candidates whistled the idealist campâs tune throughout the night. In a sense, this may be the true paradox of modern-day conservatism, as it used to mean avoiding unnecessary foreign entanglements. Itâs a shame that George Kennan had the proper take on what should have been our approach in the postâCold War era, but the beneficiaries of excessive interventionism prevailed and the âpeace dividendââ was lost. Nice article.

A right-on piece! [âPBS Follows the Pack,â March 14]. I quit watching PBS ânewsâ years ago. Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill were clearly drifting off-center and becoming shills for right-wing dogma. Now they are both solidly there, as Eric Alterman clearly demonstrates in his essay.		
Itâs a pathetic situation for our so-called âliberalâ media, but it was gratifying to see a journalist of Altermanâs clout calling these shills out, at last.

Recently, thereâs been a spike in Americans Googling âmoving abroad.â Look, I donât blame you. With Trumpâs campaign inspiring racist, hate-filled, and violent chants, America feels like itâs caught in a Twilight Zone episode mirroring Orwellâs 1984. I myself am filled with anxiety about the state of our beloved red, white, and blue, and continue to lose sleep over current happenings. As Americans threaten to abandon our nation, I wonder if Iâm alone in my attempts to return from abroad? Watching American politics unravel before me on British television, Iâve realized this isnât a time to flee; itâs a time to come home.

This isnât some savior complex, but rather a rallying cry: How dare we, as Americans, threaten to let a tyrant and bully like Trump get this far out of hand? Iâve never been ashamed to say Iâm American while living and traveling abroad, but now I say it with guilt. Guilt because weâve allowed America to disgrace itself by letting Trump claim he knows how Americans really behave and feel.		
Iâm proud of my home state of Illinois for recently protesting Trump in Chicago and Bloomington. Witnessing those movements from across the pond filled me with pride and reaffirmed that, while thereâs a lot of labor to be done stateside, there are individuals ready for hard work. America, youâre bruised, but not yet beaten. Letâs put the bottle of hatred down and come together again.

Your article âBernie Sanders, the Foreign-Policy Realist of 2016â [March 14] reinforces my desire to see him elected as president of the United States of America. As Robert English says, he is actually the most sober and clear-eyed. Bernie is our best hope to avoid a nuclear disaster.

Robert English has written an insightful piece. Hopefully, Bernie Sanders will bring Hillary Clinton further into the ârealistâ camp prior to the November election, following which she will most likely be the next presidentâa beneficiary of near-zero interest rates, better employment numbers, and low inflation.		
At any rate, regarding foreign policy, campaign promises are one matter; how policy plays out once a politician is in office is another matter entirely. If the country is lucky, Sanders might influence the Republicans as well. It is a shame that during the recent [March 10] GOP debate there was almost no critical discussion whatsoever regarding the issue of military expenditures and the present administrationâs âidealistâ foreign- policy approach. Why? Each of the candidates whistled the idealist campâs tune throughout the night. In a sense, this may be the true paradox of modern-day conservatism, as it used to mean avoiding unnecessary foreign entanglements. Itâs a shame that George Kennan had the proper take on what should have been our approach in the postâCold War era, but the beneficiaries of excessive interventionism prevailed and the âpeace dividendââ was lost. Nice article.

The âPâ Is for Propagandaâ©
A right-on piece! [âPBS Follows the Pack,â March 14]. I quit watching PBS ânewsâ years ago. Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill were clearly drifting off-center and becoming shills for right-wing dogma. Now they are both solidly there, as Eric Alterman clearly demonstrates in his essay.		
Itâs a pathetic situation for our so-called âliberalâ media, but it was gratifying to see a journalist of Altermanâs clout calling these shills out, at last.

I wish that Nan Aron, Kyle C. Barry, and The Nation would substitute the term âselective originalismâ for âoriginalismâ when describing Scaliaâs âphilosophyâ [âSupreme Court Showdown,â March 7]. One need only look to his Second Amendment or war-powers decisions to see that he was perfectly ready to abandon the Constitutionâs âoriginalâ meaning (if, indeed, that term has any purchase at all) to further his political beliefs.
