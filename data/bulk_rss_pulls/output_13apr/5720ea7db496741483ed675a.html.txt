A riot control robot that can zap people with an electrical charge has been unveiled in China.

Hailed as the country's first "intelligent security robot", it has an "electrically charged riot control tool" and an SOS button for people to notify police.

It can navigate autonomously, and uses on-board cameras to analyse situations.

A photo posted to Twitter by The People's Daily Online news site was retweeted by US intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden with the sarcastic caption: "Surely this will end well."

The robot was unveiled at the Congqing Hi-Tech Fair

The robot - which is 1.5m tall and weighs 78kg - was shown off at the Congqing Hi-Tech Fair.

It has a top speed of 11mph and can work for up to eight hours on a single charge.

It was built by the National Defence University in China and has "sensors that mimic the human brain, eyes and ears".

It has autonomous navigation and the ability to zap people

Some Twitter users compared the machine to a range of dangerous robots from science fiction movies and television series.

One said it was like ED-209 from the 1987 movie Robocop, which fired twin machine guns into one of its manufacturer's board members, but was still put into police service.

The most common comparison was to the Daleks from British television series Dr Who.

The Knightscope K5 security robot has been used in Silicon Valley since 2014 but has no offensive capabilities.
