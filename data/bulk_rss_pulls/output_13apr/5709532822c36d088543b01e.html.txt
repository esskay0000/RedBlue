A New Jersey homeownerâs Donald Trump flags have run afoul of a town ordinance that could cost him a $2,000 fine or a 90-day sentence behind bars.

Joseph Hornick displays two âTrump Make America Great Againâ campaign flags in front of his West Long Branch home and says he has a First Amendment right to express his support for the GOP presidential front-runnerâdespite whatâs on the books.

âIâm not taking the flag down, and if I do 90 days in jail, Iâll do 90 days in jail,â Hornick said.

First Amendment Rights..........................Shall Not Be Denied In America. DONALD J. TRUMP - PRESIDENT 2017

The town prohibits the public display of political lawn signs more than 30 days before an election, according to NJ.com.

New Jersey doesnât hold itâs primary until June 7.

He was ticketed March 25 after a resident who is a former Democratic councilman called police and questioned why his complaints about the flags to the municipal code enforcement officer had not resulted in a citation, NJ.com reported, citing a police report.

Hornick contends he is not displaying a lawn signâheâs flying a flag thatâs akin to one a New York Giants fan might display.

"I'm not a football fan. I'm not a sports fan. One thing I have become is a Donald Trump fan," he told NJ.com.

But West Long Branch considers the Hornick's flags the same as political lawn signs.

Violators face fines of up to $2,000, 90 days in jail or both.

Hornick said when the cops showed up March 25 he thought they were to take a report on another incident of vandalism involving the flags.

He appears before a judge April 20.
