Senate Select Intelligence Committee ChairÂ Richard Burr and ranking member Dianne Feinstein released a draft bill on Wednesday that would compel AmericanÂ companies to turn over data to the government under court order, staking out a controversial position in Congressâs ongoing fight over encrypted communications.

That debateÂ accelerated in the aftermath of last yearâs terror attacks in ParisÂ and San Bernardino, Calif., and peaked during the last several weeks as the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Apple bickered in courts and committee hearings overÂ whether the tech giant could be forced to unlock the contents of an iPhone for theÂ government.

Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Burrâs (R-N.C.) draft, which starts by stating that âno person or entity is above the law,â requires tech and communications companies to comply with court orders demanding the release of userÂ data, encrypted or otherwise, in a readable format. The government would not beginÂ storing such data on a regular basis, and the proposal would compensate tech companies that are asked toÂ unlock encrypted data that the government wants.

The government and Apple had been headed to a likely protracted and costly court showdown over the encrypted data on the iPhone used by aÂ San Bernardino terrorist. The mainÂ conflict was averted after the FBI paid professional hackers to crack the four-digit PIN on that iPhone â though itâs unclear if the FBI will share its hacking technique with Apple. But the FBI still wants to force the tech giant to unlock the device because the amount of data it can currently accessÂ limited.

Encryption has become an increasingly central issue in the national security debate, with lawmakers concerned that the codingÂ built into many tech companiesâ products jeopardizes law enforcementâs ability to learn crucial information. But tech companies and privacy advocates worry that their encryption features will start to be seen as worthless if the government can demand access to any of their products.

The bill from Feinstein and Burr seeks to strike a balance between those concerns â though not everyone agrees it is the right one.

âToday, terrorists and criminals areÂ increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,â Feinstein said in a statement. âWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.â

Burr added that he hoped the draft bill âwill start a meaningful and inclusive debate on the role of encryption and its place within the rule of law.â

By any measure, that debate is already underway: privacy advocates who were long wary of CongressÂ began to express open outrage late last week, whenÂ a draft of the Senate Intelligence Committee leadersâ initial legislation was leaked. Now that the draftÂ has been released, they are no happier with what they see.

âThis legislation would effectively prohibit Americans from protecting themselves as much as possible,â Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Wednesday.

Not only would the legislation leave people âvulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals,â Wyden argued, it would also provide an incentive to would-be terrorists to use non-American encrypted products and apps to continue their conversations. That would put terrorists further out of the reach of American authorities, Wyden argued,Â and hurt U.S. companies in the process.

Burrâs and Feinsteinâs bill isnât the only encryption proposal out there: Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) also have legislation to set up a commission to study the issue for a year and recommend the best policies.

Burr said in his statement Wednesday that he and Feinstein hope to engage everyone who is âwilling to engage constructively on this critically important and challenging issueâ as the debate continues.
