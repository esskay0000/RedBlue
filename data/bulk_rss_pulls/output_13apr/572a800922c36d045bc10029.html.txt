ROSEBUD -- An improvised explosive device (IED) was found and disabled Tuesday night under a bridge near Rosebud. 

According to Falls County Constable Richard Aleman, two juvenile boys were hunting for rabbits late Tuesday evening when they noticed suspicious items under a bridge near Farm to Market 1963. The boys notified one of their parents, who is former military personnel, and he contacted the fire department.

The fire department arrived and determined that the packages were possibly IEDs. The McLennan County Bomb Squad was called in and arrived at the scene at approximately 10:00 p.m.  An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived at approximately 11:30 p.m.

The MCSO bomb squad was able to x-ray three "suspicious devices" which included a plastic bottle wrapped in duct tape, a fuse-type detonator device, and a cooler. X-rays revealed there were shotgun shells and an unidentified liquid inside the bottle.

The bomb squad and ATF agent on scene determined the device was an IED designed to blow shrapnel. Officials breached the IED by spraying it with a "water cannon" to disable the device and determine the liquid inside.

The liquid inside of the bottle was determined to be flammable and was sent to a laboratory for further testing.

Sheriff Parnell McNamara said that the packages were capable of exploding and could have been extremely dangerous.

"Someone had made this to create lots of damage and harm," said McNamara.

The two boys who found the packages are not suspects at this time.

No injuries were reported.
