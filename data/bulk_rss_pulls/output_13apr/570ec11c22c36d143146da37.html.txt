PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – Chelsea Clinton was in Pittsburgh today to make a stop at her motherâs campaign headquarters.

However, at least one protester got inside and briefly disrupted the event.

A woman screamed in a panicked voice, “She’s killing us! She’s killing us!” repeatedly until supporters drowned her out by chanting Clinton’s name.

The protester was removed and the event continued as planned. 

Organizers say the woman protesting is known and regularly shows up at events to protest.

âTo be in this great American city, a city that has not only built bridges, but moved into the future,â said Clinton. âDemonstrating, absolutely, that you can have resilience if you are resourceful, if you donât give up, you keep working together, we can make it here in Pittsburgh and America.â

Hillary Clinton was in town last week for a rally at Carnegie Mellon University. A crowd of about 1,500 packed the gymnasium where she spoke.

The Pennsylvania primary will be held on April 26.
