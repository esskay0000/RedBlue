As someone who has been waiting patiently for Season 6 of "Game of Thrones" to start -- IS JON SNOW DEAD OR NOT? -- on April 24, I was stunned to read this bit of news courtesy of Entertainment Weekly:

DuringÂ HBOâs Facebook Live streamÂ from the eventâs red carpet, interviewer Veronica Belmont asked the Emmy-winning teamÂ ifÂ they had any âah-ha â¦Â weâve totally made itâ momentsÂ coming into season 6.

âI think, for both of us, finding out the President wanted advanced copies of the episodes was an âah-haâ moment,â [Dan]Â Weiss said. âThat was a very strange moment.â

And did they say yes?

âYes,â Weiss replied. âHeâs the leader of the free world.â

[David] Benioff added: âWhen the commander-in-chief says, âI want to see advanced episodes,â what are you gonna do?â

I didn't complain -- okay, I did -- when Obama played pickup hoops at the White House and didn't invite me. And, okay, fine that he got to sit front row for Trombone Shorty at the White House.

But, this? Â Advance episodes? This aggression will not stand, man.

As the EW story notes, the Season 6 episodes are being held incredibly tightly by HBO -- they have even refused to send out the usual screeners to critics in advance of the premiere. Â The reason it's all so closely guarded is because, for the first time in the history of the series, the TV show is running ahead of the books by George R.R. Martin on which it is based. We are all -- ALL OF US -- preparing to walk out on the tightrope with no safety net. All of us, that is, except President Obama.

This is me, right now.



For all I know, Obama is sitting in his White House movie room finding out ALL THE SECRETS of Season 6 right now. (The White House offered no comment when I asked if I could have all of the screeners. Oh, and also for a comment.)

If Obama is watching, these are the questions I need answered ASAP.

1. Is Jon Snow actually dead?

2. Is Jon Snow actually dead?

3. Is Jon Snow actually dead?

4. Who are Jon Snow's real parents?

5. Is Jon Snow actually dead?

Mr. President, feel free to email me with the answers. I'm at chris.cillizza@washpost.com.

Thanks!
