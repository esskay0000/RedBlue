WASHINGTON –  House Republicans have unveiled a $622 million measure to battle the Zika virus, offering President Barack Obama just one-third of the money he requested almost three months ago.

The measure by Kentucky Republican Harold Rogers is scheduled for a vote later this week.

The legislation provides funding for developing a vaccine, controlling the mosquitoes that spread Zika, tests to detect the virus, and international mosquito control. Zika can cause severe birth defects.

The bill is financed by cuts to unspent funding passed in 2014 to battle Ebola as well as leftover funding at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Senate is scheduled to vote on several competing Zika proposals on Tuesday, with a $1.1 billion bipartisan plan likely to get a green light in a procedural vote.
