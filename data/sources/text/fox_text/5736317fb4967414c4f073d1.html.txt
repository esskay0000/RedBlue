However you feel about public accommodations for those who experience gender dysphoria or at what point you believe a child reaches an age of decision about a matter so fraught, the practical issues here are potentially overwhelming.  Imagine yourself a teacher or principal at an overcrowded, understaffed school already groaning under federally mandated tests and the ever-lengthening demands of local and state officials.  As schools have struggled and failed to meet basic educational goals, they have been freighted with even more duties: to teach âlife skills,â nutrition and a school-board approved simulacrum of morality while simultaneously functioning as essentially medium-security prisons for fear of threats both internal and external.  The news Thursday was that you must overhaul not just your potty policies but also those for your sports teams for fear of a federal civil rights lawsuit. Worse, you had to brace for a inundation of alarmed parents. Gender dysphoria may afflict only an estimated three-tenths of a percent of Americans, but 100 percent of your studentsâ parents will have questions or concerns.  Now, if you believe strongly in biologically determined transgenderism, you may say that the government has no choice but to protect those in that struggle. If you are skeptical about the degree or prevalence of biological determinism in gender dysphoria, you might just think the world continues to go crazy.  But whatever you think, if youâre an educator, even at a private or religious school, youâd better set your sails for the storms to come.  Which brings us all, educators and non-educators alike, to the following question: why now?  Clearly the state-level move to regulate bathroom usage has been part of the reason for the federal intervention. This is a continuation of the battle between states and the Obama administration over subjects that include, yes, gay marriage, but also health insurance, power plant emissions, voter identification and on and on.  Activists push for transgender bathroom access, states push back and then the Justice Department retaliates. Itâs all part of the circle of life in the twilight of federalism.  But we suspect there is something else at work here, too.  The closing argument from the last Republican to be subsumed by de facto nominee Donald Trump was to attack Trump for opposing North Carolinaâs bathroom regulation. Well, that and venereal disease, but, hey, itâs been a weird year.  And now the Obama administration has dumped a Costco-sized jug of accelerant on the fire. And itâs at precisely the moment that Trump and his restive party are trying to come to terms. And itâs on an issue that looks like a loser for conservatives with swing-state voters.  Trump may be the undisputed king of Twitter trolling, but give Obama his due. When it comes to real-life trolling his enemies, heâs still number one.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEEâ¦ In a year when political forecasting has done some spectacular belly flops, Ben Dolnick offers a brief history of wrongness and a meditation on its effects: âFairly quickly, you move on from anonymous British scientists insisting that flying machines are not possible and long-forgotten modeling directors telling Marilyn Monroe that sheâd better look for secretarial work and into more troubling territory. Hereâs Thomas Edison predicting that radio will be not much more than a novelty. Hereâs [Albert Einstein] declaring nuclear energy unobtainable. Historyâs roster of morons, you begin to realize, bears a worrisome resemblance to its roster of geniuses. Whomever you happen to rely on for your present stable perchâJohn Oliver, Elizabeth Kolbert, the Freakonomics guys â you canât help but begin to feel the chair-legs wobble. Wrongness, now and forever, is an equal-opportunity affliction.â  Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Not listed on Cruzâs culpability roster: Himself.  Cruz himself had only positive words for the New York mogul saying just before the first GOP debate in August, âI have been glad to praise Donald Trump for speaking out boldly and brashly and for focusing on illegal immigration.â  Boehner basking in the Trump glow - Former House Speaker John Boehner is pleased with the Republican primaryâs results saying at a hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, âDonald Trump is the nominee, whether people like it or notâ¦Thank God the guy from Texas didnât win.â  The butler did it - NYT: âThe Secret Service said it would investigate Donald J. Trumpâs longtime butler over Facebook posts laced with vulgarities and epithets calling for President Obama to be killed. The racially tinged posts by the butler, Anthony Senecal, were unearthed by Mother Jones on Thursday, and referred to Mr. Obama as a âKenyan fraudâ who should be hanged for treason. âWith the last breath I draw I will help rid this America of the scum infested in its government,â Mr. Senecal wrote last May, saying that the president should be dragged from the âwhite mosqueâ and hanged âfrom the portico â count me in !!!!!â â¦Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said in an email about the posts by Mr. Senecal, âWe totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him.ââ  WaPo goes deep on Trump - WashEx: âThe Washington Post has built a sizable army of reporters to dig into every facet of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumpâs life, urged on by new owner Jeff Bezos to reveal everything about the potential nominees. Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward revealed Wednesday that the Post has assigned 20 staffers to Trump.â  [To wit - WaPo: âA recording obtained by The Washington Post captures what New York reporters and editors who covered Trumpâs early career experienced in the 1970s, â80s and â90s: calls from Trumpâs Manhattan office that resulted in conversations with âJohn Millerâ or âJohn Barronâ â public-relations men who sound precisely like Trump himself â who indeed are Trumpâ¦â]  #mediabuzz: The Megyn and The Donald - Host Howard Kurtz talks to Megyn Kelly ahead of her interview with Donald Trump, which airs on FOX broadcast stations on Tuesday.

KOCH GROUP CHALLENGES FIRST GOP INCUMBENT Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity is spending in North Carolinaâs congressional race, challenging a GOP member of Congress for the first time in the groupâs history. Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers faces two primary opponents, but the groupâs six-figure ad buy is focused more on Ellmersâ record in Washington than supporting one of her opponents. The districtâs primary will be held June 7.  Since weâre on Kochâ¦ - Charles Koch and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote a joint op-ed on the importance of free speech on college campuses, arguing that free speech challenges our assumptions for the better.  WAIT âTILL THEY FIND OUT WHERE BACON COMES FROM KPRC: âA Pearland [Texas] business owner is trying to save his restaurantâs reputation after a photo of him butchering a wild hog went viral. Jimmy Chi owns Tose Steak & Sushi at 1853 Pearland Pkwy. The photo, which was taken by a passerby at the end of April, shows Chi butchering the hog outside the back of his business. â¦  He says the hog was given to him as a gift by a few friends who went hunting. âThey went on a hunting trip that I was supposed to go on, but couldnât, so they shot a couple hogs and gave me one,â Chi said. â¦ He said the hog never set foot inside the restaurant and he never intended to serve it to customers, rather to himself. â¦ A few days after the photo was taken the Pearland Health Department inspected the restaurant and found no signs that the hog was brought in or served.â  AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLESâ¦ ââ¦The meeting [between Trump and Ryan] was supposed to do something that would unify the party. To declare that an opportunity exists is what we already knew. This is a sham marriage and the reason is simple: good will on both sides.â â Charles Krauthammer on âSpecial Report with Bret Baierâ Watch here.
