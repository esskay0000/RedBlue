Hillary Clinton is really boring. A terrible campaigner. An awful politician who will have a tough time against Donald Trump.

And thatâs the assessment coming from her allies.

Itâs a bit of political jujitsu, taking your candidateâs weaknesses and trying to spin them into strengths. It is also a classic case of lowering expectations.

Above all, it looks like a coordinated effort by Hillaryland to blunt criticism of the presumptive Democratic nominee whoâs still having trouble beating a 74-year-old socialist in many of the primaries.

My own reporting indicates that Clinton has decided sheâs never going to out-Trump Trump, sheâs never going to be flashier, so she would rather run as the candidate of stability. The campaign believes that if sheâs seen as a nerdy wonk with lengthy position papers, thatâs not a bad contrast with a Republican accused by some in his own party of being thin on policy specifics.

I was thinking about Hillary and the media even before this latest spate of stories. On my show, I often look for good sound bites after she has done an interviewâshe doesnât do that many--or given a speech, and thereâs very little to work with. The same thing applies to finding a juicy quote or two for a column. (This is not exactly a problem with Trump.)

Iâm not referring here to Clintonâs disciplined refusal to respond to Trumpâs attacks. That may make sense from her point of view. Itâs her plodding, cautious, bureaucratic style that often fails to break through. Her answers may be substantive, but to use a television term, she doesnât pop.

Does this matter? Well, Trump has driven the news coverage surrounding this campaign from the day he got in the race. Clinton just doesnât make that much news.

The Clinton campâs view is that she gets plenty of good local press when she campaigns in such states as Kentucky, which votes today, and thereâs little desire to compete with Trump in racking up segments on the cable networksâespecially if those are about his relationships with women or not releasing his tax returns.

For many months, the imbalance in the national media could be explained away by the fact the Republican contest was a wild roller-coaster ride while Clinton was easily cruising to the Democratic nomination. But now that itâs essentially a general electionâeven though Bernie is still hanging aroundâTrump is still dominating the news.

Some of the Trump stories are obviously negative, as with the lengthy New York Times report saying he âcrossed the lineâ with some women. (That story took a hit when the woman in the lead anecdote, Rowanne Brewer Lane, who dated Trump after he asked her to change to a swimsuit at a pool party, told âFox & Friendsâ and others that her experience was positive and the paper unfairly spun her words.)  

But even the critical stories give Trump a chance to counterpunch against the media (such as calling the Times report a âlame hit pieceâ), grabbing the available oxygen and denying it to his Democratic opponent. Clinton tends to make news more through her aides and surrogates than with her own words.

Thatâs why a Time magazine headline declares: âHillaryâs new plan to trump Trumpâby being boring.â

She doesnât want a âmud fightâ with Trump, the piece says. âSheâs a lousy politician, by her own admissionâ¦Americans like Hillary Clinton the nerdy technocrat. They do not like Hillary Clinton the candidate.â The magazine casts the race as âthe great boor vs. the great bore.â

The Washington Post weighed in yesterday by quoting âmore than a dozen Clinton alliesâ who identified her âweaknessesâ against Trump, âincluding poor showings with young women, untrustworthiness, unlikability and a lackluster style on the stump.â

Advisers, the Post says, are trying âto soften her stiff public image by highlighting her compassionâ¦She is scripted and thin-skinned, they say. And with a sigh, they acknowledge the persistent feeling among a lot of Americans that they just donât like her.â

They just donât like her. Well, the polls show that many voters donât like Trump either. But those who do are passionate about the billionaire, just as Sanders supporters are passionate about their man. Clinton, despite her long experience, doesnât come across as an inspirational figure.

Stories like these donât appear in the press by accident. Those in Clintonâs orbit are trying to justify a soft-spoken strategy that, at the moment, is being drowned out by the high-decibel Trump. They want Hillary to be viewed as a reliable grandmother, not the calculating politician who is under investigation for using a private email server, and not as risky as the bombastic Trump.

But she still has to find a way to make news, on her own. The danger is that sheâll come to be viewed as a dull and conventional candidate in a year in which voters are rejecting politics as usual.
