A Donald Trump "spokesman" who briefed reporters about the billionaire's exploits in the '80s and '90s -- when his love life was splashed all over the tabloids -- was actually Trump himself, according to a new report. 

The Washington Post unearthed a 1991 recording between a People magazine reporter and Trump spokesman âJohn Millerâ -- whom the newspaper reports was none other than Trump, posing as his own PR guy. 

On NBC's "Today" show Friday, Trump denied being the voice on the phone. He said: "I don't know anything about it." 

But he apparently owned up to it at the time, describing the Miller call as a "joke gone awry," said the Post. 

In the recording, reporter Sue Carswell asks âMillerâ about Trumpâs 12-year marriage to Ivana Trump, his relationship with model Marla Maples and his rumored affairs with a number of high-profile celebrities.

Miller talked casually, at length and in surprising detail about Trump's relationships, his attachments with various celebrities, and his reasons for ending his relationship with Maples.

âHe really didnât want to make a commitment,â Miller said in the tape. âHeâs coming out of a marriage, and heâs starting to do tremendously well financially.â

In the tape, Miller also tells Carswell about a meeting between Trump and singer Madonna, and tells her that while Madonna wanted to go out with him, âheâs got zero interest that night.â

The Post claims that John Miller was one of several alter-egos used by Trump, who had previously used the name âJohn Barronâ as early as 1980 to talk to The New York Times. The Post reports that calls from Barron were so common it became a recurring joke at the New York tabloids.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.
