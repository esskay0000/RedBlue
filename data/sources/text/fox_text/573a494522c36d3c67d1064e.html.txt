Hillary Clinton says sheâs got big plans for her husband if sheâs elected president â but that apparently does not include installing Bill Clinton in her Cabinet.

The Democratic presidential front-runner ruled out that scenario during a campaign stop Monday in Paducah, Ky.

On the stump, she repeated her vow to bring her ex-president husband âout of retirementâ and put him to work in her administration. But later asked if heâd be a part of her Cabinet, Clinton shook her head and mouthed the word, âNo.â

Hillary Clinton previously has indicated she wants to put her husband in charge of bringing back manufacturing jobs; in what capacity, she has not specified.

Clinton is campaigning in Kentucky ahead of the stateâs Democratic primary on Tuesday. Oregon also holds its primary on Tuesday.

Though she continues to face a primary challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clintonâs allied super PAC already is turning its attention toward an expected November fight against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.
