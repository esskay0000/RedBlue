THE BROOKINGS Institution and the Wilson Centre, two Washington think-tanks, are putting the “fun” in “funding the federal government”. They have launched an online minigame which challenges all comers to balance the budget (or at least, keep the debt-to-GDP ratio from rising) over 25 years, without throwing their favourite policies overboard. Choose imprudently and the “fiscal ship”—also the title of the game—will sink. The wonks hope to reach perhaps half a million voters and schoolchildren who might otherwise never realise that tweaking the corporate tax code can be fun. The Wilson’s Centre’s previous effort, “Budget Hero”, was played over 2m times. Hopefully, players will find it easier to control spending than the think-tanks did: the new game set them back about $1m.
