Ohio Gov. John Kasich dismissed any possibility that he would run as an independent or on a third party ticket against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

âI just don’t think it would be the right thing to do,â he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday. âA third party candidacy would be viewed as kind of a silly thing.â

Kasich dropped out of the Republican primary contest on May 4, the day after the Indiana primary, which Trump beat expectations and won.

âI’m not gonna do that,â Kasich told Cooper in the interview to air Monday night. âI gave it my best where I am. I just think running a third party doesn’t feel right. I think it’s not constructive.â

Kasich won only his home state of Ohio in primary contest, but he said he has been contacted for a potential third party run by Republicans opposed to Trump.Â
