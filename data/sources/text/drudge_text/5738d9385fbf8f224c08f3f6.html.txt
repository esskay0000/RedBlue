UPDATE——– #NEVERTRUMPER GOT THUMPED—
NEBRASKA REPUBLICANS PASS RESOLUTION TO REPRIMAND #NEVERTRUMPER BEN SASSE
(More below)

The Nebraska Republican State Convention is underway today in Omaha, Nebraska.

Republican Sam Fischer introduced a resolution to reprimand Senator Ben Sasse for his outspoken attacks on Republican nominee Donald Trump and for leading the anti-Trump movement.

Sasse, a Republican, is the top Republican office holder pushing for a third party run this fall against Donald Trump.

In effect, Ben Sasse is supporting Hillary Clinton.

Today a motion was introduced to reprimand Senator Sasse.
Here is the latest.

The person who introduced the Sasse-slapdown resolution at State GOP is the nephew of U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer – Sam Fischer

Sasse spoke earlier today at the convention.
The Delegates are VERY UPSET with Sasse.


Delegate after delegate at State GOP Convention say they’re “disappointed” with Sasse for heading national anti-Trump movement

UPDATE——–
NEBRASKA REPUBLICANS PASS RESOLUTION TO REPRIMAND #NEVERTRUMPER BEN SASSE
The Vote was around 400 to 8!

It was a lopsided vote. The “ayes” in the room of more than 400 had an audible win. Only about six or eight yelled “nay.”

Supporters (rightfully) say Sasse’ anti-Trump rhetoric will only help Hillary Clinton!

It was a bitter/sweet day for the Nebraska freshman senator.

It was a bitter/sweet day for Sasse. He was greetly warmly by some delegates today, who then slapped him down for anti-Trump stance
