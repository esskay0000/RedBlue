A man has died from injuries he sustained when he was attacked queuing for food at a Sacramento hip-hop festival on the weekend. 

The victim, whose name has not yet been released, was attending radio station KSFM 1025’s sold out fest Sunday at Discovery Park, which featured a lineup of Ty Dolla $ign, E-40, Kehlani, the Internet, Lil Dicky, Desiigner and others.“We are deeply saddened by the senseless tragedy that took place in line at a food stand yesterday. We want to extend our condolences to the family and friends of the victim during this difficult time. Thank you for your patience,” organizers wrote in a social media post. 

 

According to reports, the man was unresponsive after being punched and was pronounced dead at the hospital. Sacramento police have announced an investigation is underway.

In a separate incident earlier in the day, a number of concert-goers suffered “trample injuries” as a fire in the food vendor area ignited a stampede. The fire, caused by a deep-frier, lit a propane tank which fire-fighters quickly extinguished.
