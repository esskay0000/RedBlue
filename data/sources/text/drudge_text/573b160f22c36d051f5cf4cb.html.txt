AUSTIN - The man who said an employee at Whole Foods, Inc. wrote a homophobic slur on a cake has withdrawn his lawsuit and now says the company “did nothing wrong.”

Jordan Brown made the initial allegations more than three weeks ago. The openly gay pastor said at the time that he ordered a cake with the phrase “Love Wins” on it and instead got a cake with that phrase and a homophobic slur on it.

Whole Foods has now dropped their counter suit after "the truth has come to light," according to a statement from the company.

Brown said in a statement Monday morning that he was “wrong to pursue this matter and use the media to perpetuate this story.”

“I want to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning the company’s commitment to its values, and especially the baker associate who I understand was put in a terrible position because of my actions,” Brown said in his statement Monday.

Brown continued, “I apologize to the LGBT community for diverting attention from real issues. I also want to apologize to my partner, my family, my church family, and my attorney.”

Brown was represented in the initial lawsuit by Austin Kaplan. Whole Foods immediately fought back against the lawsuit when it was initially filed with a countersuit. The company released surveillance video showing Brown purchasing the cake and also said at the time that they stood behind their team member in the suit.
