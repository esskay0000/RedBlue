CHICAGO (CBS) — While the Transportation Security Administration has announced plans to hire 800 new officers, the wait for security at Chicagoâs airports could be getting worse.

Tuesday morning, the cityâs Aviation Department advised anyone flying out of OâHare or Midway airports to show up three hours before their flightâs scheduled departure time. Thatâs even longer than the two-hour cushion the TSA has suggested for domestic flights.

Over the past several days, many passengers have said they missed their flights in Chicago, even after following the TSAâs recommendations to show up two hours early for a domestic flight, because theyâve had to wait up to three hours in line for security.

At 6 a.m. Tuesday, the Chicago Department of Aviation sent out messages on its Twitter accounts for OâHare and Midway, advising travelers about unusually long lines for security.

The TSA has announced plans to hire nearly 800 new officers and pay for more part-time workers and overtime, in an effort to address worsening wait times at airport security checkpoints. The agency has said the increasingly long lines at airports are the result of a combination of increased traveler volumes and TSA staffing shortages due to federal budget cuts.

The union that represents TSA officers has said the agency needs to hire 6,000 employees to fully staff security lines.
