A senior Iranian military commander claimed that U.S. officials are quietly encouraging the Islamic Republic to keep its illicit ballistic missile tests a secret so as not to raise concerns in the region, according to Persian language comments.

Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corpsâ Aerospace and Missile Force, said in recent remarks that the Obama administration does not want Iran to publicize its ongoing missile tests, which have raised questions about the Islamic Republicâs commitment to last summerâs comprehensive nuclear agreement.

âAt this time, the Americans are telling [us]: ‘Don’t talk about missile affairs, and if you conduct a test or maneuver, don’t mention it,’â Hajizadeh was quoted as saying during a recent Persian-language speech that was translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute.

âIf we agree to this, they will advance another step, and say: ‘Don’t conduct [a missile test] at this time, and also don’t do it in the Persian Gulf region.’ After that, they will tell us: ‘Why do you need your missiles to have a range of 2,000 km [anyway?]?’ Hajizadeh reportedly said.

The military commander expressed concern that the United States will attempt to dissuade Iran from developing missile technology capable of carrying a nuclear payload.

âAfter that, they will tell [us]: ‘Next, we will check whether your missiles can really carry nuclear weapons. Bring us the details [of the missiles].’ After that, they will say: ‘We need to set up cameras.’ And, finally, they will say: ‘Either saw [the missiles up into pieces] or, like [Libyan dictator Mu’ammar] Gadhafi, load them onto a ship and hand [them] over to us.’â he said.

Hajizadeh further claimed that the United States âcannot be trusted.â

Iran, he said, âmust face them down firmly, and we must act. If we do not, we will witness daily their exaggerated and evil demands.â

âThey are clearly deluding themselves. Nothing like this will ever happen,â he added.

A State Department official declined to comment on the remarks, telling the Washington Free Beacon that it is U.S. policy to avoid responding publicly to Iran.

âWe generally donât comment on public remarks by Iranian officials, and especially IRGC officials,â the official told the Free Beacon.Â âWeâre not going to start now.â
