An investigation has detailed the 860 calls made to police – and where they were made – moaning about drones in 2015.

Calls include people claiming drones are being used to peek into their houses, to film schools and playgrounds, of being a general nuisance, and of flying into airplane flightpaths.

Other calls said a drone hit them in the eye, was filming females and that one drone resembled the size of a small car.

Chief technology officer Charles Kennelly, whose firm Esri UK Drones compiled the data for the police, said: "Drones offer many benefits but can also be perceived as a general nuisance, invading privacy or even conducting suspicious and potentially illegal behaviour.

"With drone sales increasing, we need to be more aware of both their positive and negative impacts."

The Freedom of Information (FOI) request, made by Mail Online, revealed that 90 of the 860 calls were made to Greater Manchester police.

Sussex came in at second with 76 calls, 55 were made to West Mercia, 45 to Cambridgeshire, 37 to Nottinghamshire, 34 to Avon and Somerset, 32 to Cheshire, 31 to Suffolk, 31 to Leicestershire, and 30 to South Wales Police.

The fresh revelation comes after a Daily Star Online investigation last year found drones were being used to obtain illicit videos – including intimate moments between couples

West Yorkshire missed the deadline for the request while Essex, Hampshire, Police Scotland, Surrey, Thames Valley and Wiltshire Police said it would be too expensive to do the research.

City of London Police and North Wales Police said it had no calls.

Other complaints about the hovering Peeping Toms include claims of the gadgets floating in and around prisons.

Tech-savvy lags are using drones to fly mobile phones and legal highs into prisons across the UK.

Drones can be bought online, and one model being sold on eBay is priced at £3.59.

The EsriUK report said: "The tone of the calls reveal the public is concerned about drones being used in a range of ways.

"This includes concerns about invasion of privacy with people using drone-mounted cameras to look into their houses or appearing to film over schools and playgrounds, causing a general nuisance by flying too close to their home or garden, flying into flight paths, spying on properties in order to plan burglaries, hovering over prisons, and flying too high breaching height regulations."
