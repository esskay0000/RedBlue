SIDtoday is the internal newsletter for the NSAâs most important division, the Signals Intelligence Directorate. After editorial review, The Intercept is releasing nine yearsâ worth of newsletters in batches, starting with 2003.

Major topics include the National Security Agencyâs role in interrogations, the Iraq War, the war on terror, new leadership in the Signals Intelligence Directorate, and new, popular uses of the internet and of mobile computing devices.Along with this batch, we are publishing the stories featured below, which explain how and why weâre releasing these documents, provide an overview of SIDtoday as a publication, report on one especially newsworthy set of revelations, and round up other interesting tidbits from the  files.
