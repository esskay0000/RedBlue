A huge flash lit up the sky across New England around 1 a.m. Tuesday. Hundreds of people across the region reported seeing the flash, which was likely a fireball: a bright meteor or object that enters Earth's atmosphere.

The sight was captured on police dashcam video in Portland, Maine, and also spotted by necn viewers from Killington, Vermont, to Haverhill, Massachusetts. It illuminated the night sky forÂ just a few seconds before fading away.

"The meteor (or alien spaceship) was caught on camera at approximately 0050 hours," the Portland Police Department wrote on Facebook. "Let's hope the visitors are friendly. They could just be some of Stephen King's friends on there way to visit him. Whomever they are I'm sure we could win them over with a whoopie pie."

Atop the Mount Washington Observatory, fog prevented observers from noticing anything.
