GOODYEAR, Ariz. (KSAZ) - Police arrested a man over the weekend for allegedly sacrificing his family's dog.

Goodyear police say 42-year-old Patrick Thompson was arrested at his home near Estrella Parkway and Yuma road on Sunday after police received reports of trouble at the home.

When officers arrived, they found Thompson lying on the sidewalk and he told police that the "devil" made him do it and he had to "do it for God."

After searching the home, police found the family's white dog dead inside an industrial-sized smoker.

Investigators learned that Thompson killed the dog after he became angry because of a shirt that his 17-year-old daughter was wearing.

Thompson then took his daughter's shirt and burned it inside the smoker. Thompson then went back inside the home, began acting erratically and told his wife and children that he had to "sacrifice a male."

When Thompson's family tried to leave the home, he grabbed the dog, snapped its neck and burned it inside the smoker.

While being questioned by police, Thompson admitted to smoking marijuana and said he "had a vision" after becoming upset over his daughter's shirt.

Thompson has been booked into Fourth Avenue Jail and is charged with animal cruelty, assault and disorderly conduct.
