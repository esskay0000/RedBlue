WILMETTE, Ill. -- Singer-songwriterÂ Sinead O'Connor was found safe after being reported missing in Chicago's northern suburbs earlier Monday.

Sources tell WGN she was located at a nearby hotel, and has been taken to a local hospital.

O'Connor, who is most popular for the 1990 release "Nothing Compares 2Â U" that was written by Prince,Â went out on a bicycle ride at about 6 a.m.Â in Wilmette SundayÂ and hadÂ not been seen since.

What she was doing in Wilmette is still unclear.Â TMZÂ had reportedÂ that policeÂ listed her as a "missing suicidal."

She was last seen on aÂ Raleigh motorized bicycle with a pink basket wearing a black parka, black leather pants and a sweatshirt with "Ireland" on the back. She had gotten medical treatment back in NovemberÂ after leaving an angry suicidal note for her family.

O'Connor was recently in the news for being sued by comedian Arsenio Hall for making statements after Prince's death that Hall supplied Prince with drugs.
