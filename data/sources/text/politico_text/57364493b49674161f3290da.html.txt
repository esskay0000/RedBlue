An energetic Marco Rubio told a crowd of supporters in Miami he is an underdog in "a country of underdogs," but would win the Republican nomination no matter how many states it took.

Remarking on why he is so "passionate about this election," the Florida senator told the home-state crowd, "I will campaign as long as it takes and wherever it takes to ensure that I am the next president of the United States."

“We will not allow the party of Lincoln and Reagan to fall into the hands of a con artist," Rubio said, alluding to New York mogul Donald Trump. "We will not allow the next president of the United States to be a socialist like Bernie Sanders. And we will not allow the next president of the United States to be someone under FBI investigation, like Hillary Clinton."

Looking ahead to the Florida primary on March 15, Rubio vowed to win the state, telling his supporters they would "send a message" to the political world.

Rubio then switched to Spanish, "because we're in Miami."

"We are ready to campaign in all 50 states. In Puerto Rico," he said, in Spanish. "In wherever we have to go to ensure that the party of Reagan and of Lincoln remains a conservative party of principles, of seriousness, with the promises of liberty, democracy, a free press and the constitution of the Untied States."

He then finished in English.

“Florida, I know you’re ready. The pundits say we’re underdogs, I’ll accept that. We’ve all been underdogs," Rubio said, in closing. "This is a community of underdogs. This is a state of underdogs. This is a country of underdogs, but we will win."
