For the second Tuesday in a row, Bernie Sanders has won a Democratic primary in a state that Hillary Clinton won in the partyâs 2008 nomination race. Last week he took Indiana from Clinton. This week he has taken West Virginia.

						});
					
The Sanders win in West Virginia was a big one. The senator secured 51 percent of the vote to 36 percent for the former secretary of state. He carried every county in the stateâtaking several with over 60 percent of the vote.				
					
					
Sanders has now won 20 Democratic contests and 1,430 delegates.				
					
					
The senator is still trailing Clinton, who has prevailed in 26 contests and secured more than 1,716 delegates. Even as she was losing West Virginia, Clinton picked up 11 pledged delegates. And with unelected superdelegates counted in, Clinton is over the 2,200 mark in a race where 2,384 delegate votes are needed to win the nomination.				
			

							Sanders says Democrats must build a broad anti-Trump coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality.
						
 
Yet, with another primary state counted in his column, Sanders continues to upend the argument that Democratic race is done. He is still in the running. He will continue to compete for states and delegatesâhaving declared in Oregon on Tuesday night that âwe will keep fighting for every last vote.â He will continue to look for opportunities to shape the Democratic message for a fall race against the most divisive Republican nominee in modern political history.				
					
					
âOur message to the Democratic delegates who will be assembling in Philadelphia is, while we may have many disagreements with Secretary Clinton, there is one area we agree: We must defeat Donald Trump,â Sanders told thousands of cheering supporters in Oregon on Tuesday night.				
					
					
That Trump will be the Republican nominee in 2016 was reaffirmed by the voters of West Virginia and Nebraska on Tuesday. (Nebraska Democrats caucused on March 5 and gave Sanders a 57-43 win. However, in Nebraskaâs non-binding primary vote Tuesday, Clinton was ahead.)

For Trump, Tuesdayâs primaries were essentially a victory lap. Since his Republican rivals have suspended their campaigns, the only question was whether West Virginia and Nebraska voters would register significant #NeverTrump protest votes. They didnât. With the majority of votes counted, Trump was winning 61 percent of the vote in Nebraska and 76 percent of the vote in West Virginia. (Even among Democratic primary voters in West Virginia, roughly one-third indicated that they could back Trump in November.)				
					
					
Tuesdayâs primary wins will give Trump a boost as he goes into Thursdayâs high-stakes meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan.				
					
					
No matter how that meeting goes, however, the Democrats know they will be running against Trump.				
			

							Clinton is toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. 
						
 
The question is how they will run.				
					
					
About last weekâs reports that Clinton was soliciting support from Republican donors who were unsettled by Trump, Sanders said on Friday, âThose are the kinds of things that make not only my supporters, but millions of Americans, nervous.â				
					
					
Sanders argues that Democrats must recognize that, in many states, the dynamics of a fall race against Trump will not follow classic Democrat-versus-Republican or left-versus-right calculations. Thereâs an up-versus-down dynamic, as well, and the senator says Democrats must build a broad coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality. Noting reports that Clinton âis now reaching out to Jeb Bushâs fundraisers in order to raise money from them,â Sanders says âthat really casts a doubt on the parts of millions of Americans.â				
					
					
âAre you really going to stand up for the middle and working class when youâre collecting millions from Jeb Bush supporters?â asks the insurgent contender.				
					
					
The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. âWe are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,â says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for âa $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutionsâ¦â

Thatâs a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that âSix in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nationâs economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this yearâfar above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.â Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that âweâre going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, âWeâre going to make it clear that we donât want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now weâve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I donât want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.â Thatâs not far from the stance taken by Sandersâwho says Democrats should support âa carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.â But the senatorâs win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and sheâs toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. âI have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreementâand that means before and after the election,â she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
âIâm not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,â Clinton added. âI think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.â				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential âgold standardâ agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, âIn my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.â				
					
					
Sanders has long argued that the United States must âfundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.â Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argumentâas part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for âthe American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.â				
					
					
		

The Sanders win in West Virginia was a big one. The senator secured 51 percent of the vote to 36 percent for the former secretary of state. He carried every county in the stateâtaking several with over 60 percent of the vote.

That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and sheâs toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. âI have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreementâand that means before and after the election,â she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
âIâm not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,â Clinton added. âI think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.â				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential âgold standardâ agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, âIn my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.â				
					
					
Sanders has long argued that the United States must âfundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.â Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argumentâas part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for âthe American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.â				
					
					
		


							Sanders says Democrats must build a broad anti-Trump coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality.
						


Yet, with another primary state counted in his column, Sanders continues to upend the argument that Democratic race is done. He is still in the running. He will continue to compete for states and delegatesâhaving declared in Oregon on Tuesday night that âwe will keep fighting for every last vote.â He will continue to look for opportunities to shape the Democratic message for a fall race against the most divisive Republican nominee in modern political history.				
					
					
âOur message to the Democratic delegates who will be assembling in Philadelphia is, while we may have many disagreements with Secretary Clinton, there is one area we agree: We must defeat Donald Trump,â Sanders told thousands of cheering supporters in Oregon on Tuesday night.				
					
					
That Trump will be the Republican nominee in 2016 was reaffirmed by the voters of West Virginia and Nebraska on Tuesday. (Nebraska Democrats caucused on March 5 and gave Sanders a 57-43 win. However, in Nebraskaâs non-binding primary vote Tuesday, Clinton was ahead.)

For Trump, Tuesdayâs primaries were essentially a victory lap. Since his Republican rivals have suspended their campaigns, the only question was whether West Virginia and Nebraska voters would register significant #NeverTrump protest votes. They didnât. With the majority of votes counted, Trump was winning 61 percent of the vote in Nebraska and 76 percent of the vote in West Virginia. (Even among Democratic primary voters in West Virginia, roughly one-third indicated that they could back Trump in November.)				
					
					
Tuesdayâs primary wins will give Trump a boost as he goes into Thursdayâs high-stakes meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan.				
					
					
No matter how that meeting goes, however, the Democrats know they will be running against Trump.				
			

							Clinton is toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. 
						
 
The question is how they will run.				
					
					
About last weekâs reports that Clinton was soliciting support from Republican donors who were unsettled by Trump, Sanders said on Friday, âThose are the kinds of things that make not only my supporters, but millions of Americans, nervous.â				
					
					
Sanders argues that Democrats must recognize that, in many states, the dynamics of a fall race against Trump will not follow classic Democrat-versus-Republican or left-versus-right calculations. Thereâs an up-versus-down dynamic, as well, and the senator says Democrats must build a broad coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality. Noting reports that Clinton âis now reaching out to Jeb Bushâs fundraisers in order to raise money from them,â Sanders says âthat really casts a doubt on the parts of millions of Americans.â				
					
					
âAre you really going to stand up for the middle and working class when youâre collecting millions from Jeb Bush supporters?â asks the insurgent contender.				
					
					
The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. âWe are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,â says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for âa $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutionsâ¦â

Thatâs a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that âSix in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nationâs economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this yearâfar above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.â Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that âweâre going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, âWeâre going to make it clear that we donât want to forget those people.

Thereâs an up-versus-down dynamic, as well, and the senator says Democrats must build a broad coalition of Americans who are angered by economic inequality. Noting reports that Clinton âis now reaching out to Jeb Bushâs fundraisers in order to raise money from them,â Sanders says âthat really casts a doubt on the parts of millions of Americans.â				
					
					
âAre you really going to stand up for the middle and working class when youâre collecting millions from Jeb Bush supporters?â asks the insurgent contender.				
					
					
The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. âWe are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,â says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for âa $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutionsâ¦â

Thatâs a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that âSix in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nationâs economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this yearâfar above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.â Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that âweâre going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, âWeâre going to make it clear that we donât want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now weâve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I donât want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.â Thatâs not far from the stance taken by Sandersâwho says Democrats should support âa carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.â But the senatorâs win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and sheâs toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. âI have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreementâand that means before and after the election,â she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.				
					
					
âIâm not interested in tinkering around the margins of our trade policy,â Clinton added. âI think we need a fundamental rethink of how we approach trade deals going forward.â				
					
					
That stance moves Clinton (who as secretary of state talked up the TPP as a potential âgold standardâ agreement but has since expressed her opposition) closer to the position taken by Sanders, a fierce critic of the deal who told the Oregon coalition, âIn my view, the TPP is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.â				
					
					
Sanders has long argued that the United States must âfundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.â Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argumentâas part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for âthe American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.â				
					
					
		

No matter how that meeting goes, however, the Democrats know they will be running against Trump.

Sanders has long argued that the United States must âfundamentally rewrite our trade agreements to protect the environment and raise living standards in the U.S. and throughout the world.â Now he is arguing that the Democratic platform must make the same argumentâas part of a campaign that counters the crude populism of Donald Trump with an jobs-and-justice message that speaks absolutely and unequivocally to the great mass of voters who are worried about the economy.				
					
					
That, Sanders said in Salem, is a unifying message for âthe American people who understand that bringing us together always trumps dividing us up.â				
					
					
		

The argument that Sanders makes is that Democrats must mount a fall campaign that addresses the concerns of the great mass of Americans who are on the downside of the economic-inequality divide. âWe are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,â says Sanders, who wants to see that agenda spelled out in a platform that calls for âa $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutionsâ¦â

Thatâs a message that played well Tuesday in West Virginia, where the ABC News analysis of exit polling found that âSix in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the nationâs economy in the next few years, by far the highest level of economy worry in a Democratic primary this yearâfar above the average, 40 percent, and rivaling the customary level seen in Republican primaries.â Sanders ran especially well among voters who said they were very very worried about the economy, who said they thought trade policies harm US workers and who came from coal-mining families.				
					
					
Clinton took heat for saying in March that âweâre going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â In fairness, she promised in the same appearance, âWeâre going to make it clear that we donât want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now weâve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I donât want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.â Thatâs not far from the stance taken by Sandersâwho says Democrats should support âa carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.â But the senatorâs win in West Virginia (a state Clinton won in 2008 by a 67-26 margin) suggests the appeal of his economic focus.				
					
					
That focus could also prove to be appealing in the fall in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states where some recent polls have suggested Trump is more competitive than had been anticipated.				
					
					
This is the point Sanders will make in the primary battles that are yet to come.				
					
					
The insurgent seems to be making an impression on the front-runner. Clinton has stepped up her campaigning in one of the next primary states, Kentucky, and sheâs toughening her talk on the key issue of trade. âI have said I oppose the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] agreementâand that means before and after the election,â she replied to a question from the Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, a coalition of more than two dozen labor, environmental, and human-rights organizations that is sharply critical of the TPP deal.

I have participated in elections since 1968 and the sad truth of the matter is that I feel That Bill Clinton was one of the worst presidents of our time--reference his choices for  our economy -- the trade deals,helping the Rs get rid of Glass-Seagal-ending welfare as we knew it-his law and order initiatives -I could go on. 
That Hillary Clinton has supported all of these things and has been one of the worst hawks in the Democratic party--has recently proposed sending children back to the country where she supported a coup and that  has since become a death squads&apos; haven against environmental and !st nation activists does not make me think she is much much of a choice. And that the party has been missing in action protecting the voting rights of citizens it is becoming clear that the leadership is as bought off as the Rs
If Hillary picks a good progressive-stops the  corporate hack take over of the convention(see sponsors to convention and chairs for platform ) -and starts to actively support the policies that can return our democracy and economy to the benefit of the majority of us---if she can manage that she might win against  Trump-if not -to misquote Harry Truman-they,ll pick the republican every time.

Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought Nation readers could hate Clinton so much that they would support Trump. Meaning they are fellow travelers with David Duke, Sarah Palin, KKK.

Sorry you see it that way, Walsh, but Clinton&apos;s track record of causing wars, horrible misery, morbidity and human migration (causing drowning deaths) is what we see, and then much of this is done at the whim of industrial corporation.  Donald Trump is becoming famous for refusing to be a lapdog for the right and left establishment politics.  Your guilt-by-indirect-association-with-Republicans is a weak  insinuation in the real world, and comes off like a tabloid sensation (i.e.: headline: "Hillary Clinton says &apos;Sanders owes Sandy Hook Moms an Apology&apos; ".)

So you would support Trump who has told the electorate that the minimum wage, $7.50 per hr I believe is too much. Trump has promised to defund Planned parenthood which delivers health care to both men and women. He has promised to punish women, only I might add not their partners, for getting and abortion. Supreme Court appointees who will end Roe v Wade, deny Muslims entry. He has some crazy plan for the Middle East which with his lousy communication skills can&apos;t be good. This is your candidate? This is what socialists do when they don&apos;t get their way? Step aside for a racist, sexist candidate?

That kind of insult is unacceptable. People here have an aversion to Hillary for very legitimate reasons. To this particular subscriber, the most important issue ever facing this country is the one of war and peace/life and death. On that one issue, that most important trait of judgment, Bernie Sanders has a stellar record of being on the right side of those decisions. Hillary Clinton is a hawk. That fact is well known. How do Clinton supporters justify voting for someone with such impaired judgment on whether or not to send other people&apos;s children to die or be maimed? Please elaborate, because it&apos;s impossible for me to comprehend.

The main fact that few media outlets are mentioning is that Hillary just cannot seem to close the deal. If she is really the &apos;best, most qualified&apos; candidate, if her election is inevitable and Bernie Sanders simply does not have any chance of winning as the establishment and MSM has been arguing since the primaries began why hasn&apos;t 45% of the electorate agreed with them and backed her. She cannot win the election without the establishment a.k.a. super delegates closing the deal for her.  When will the Democratic party wake up and realize that protecting Clinton because it is her turn is not in the best interests of the country?

After the last primary vote is cast, regardless if either has an insignificant number "edge" over the other - Sanders or Clinton - super delegates will have to decide who is more qualified to stir the most voter turnout on election day for the Democratic Party Nationwide, enough to defeat the Republicans, in all three branches of government.  I am confident they will do the right thing.  If they don not do the right thing, I am confident they will lose, in all three branches of government.

Nominating "by decree" with super-delegates is a bogus form of democracy, not my favorite, but it is how they are playing the "game" nowadays, so unfortunately this "Sophie&apos;s Choice" is the monster they themselves have created.  It&apos;s their problem, no Sanders nor mine.

In the past, during routine primaries, de facto Democratic/Republican Party winning candidates were already known, and accepted by the public - at  this chronological point in the primary.  2016 is not a routine primary.  There are major issues never before discussed, besides dirty tricks, extremely unbalanced media coverage, and revolution in the air, for all  political persuasions.  Within such an environment, all possibilities and probabilities for ultimate nomination should be explored and respected.  Campaigns, pundits, and politicians, who frame any primary campaign or any primary convention in 2015-2016, as "routine" believe so at their own peril.

Well, NY Times election tracking finally has it: Sanders has 18 delegates; Clinton, 11.  I guess the "other" protest candidate had 2 delegates rooting for them, and they had to decide what to do, according to rules, etc.  What an education, and it&apos;s tuition-free!

the Democratic party is looking like they are about to throw the progressives under the bus a they did with McGovern-look where it got us-a party that has lost every branch of government but a very weak presidency and most governors and state houses. Isn&apos;t it time to take a lesson from FDR and put our efforts behind promoting the solutions that turned this nation around in a few years.We have never lost anything putting our  faith in working people and everything putting our faith in the money people.

John Nichols is wrong to go on teasing and confusing Sanders supporters with any ideas that the nomination is in any way still up for grabs, that Bernie has not already lost and lost badly, that he isn&apos;t embarrassing himself and misleading his followers by running a zombie campaign that cannot win.
Nichols is not new-be to political campaigns and delegate counts: he knows that Sanders honestly and truly lost weeks and weeks ago.  Nichols watched the 2008 race and delegate contest between Hillary and Barack as closely as any of us did then and knows from that excruciating  last couple of months of their campaigns that there is no coming back from the deficit Bernie and his campaign have created for himself.  Nichols is being cruel to people who just can&apos;t let go, people who think Bernie is the only honest politician that was ever born, that only he can press forward with a progressive agenda.
He remembers that Hillary won the last few big primaries in 2008 but that it was absolutely a done deal with barack ahead by an increasingly stubborn 100 to 120 delegates.  John Nichols knows that no more than 20 or so superdelegates switched from Hillary to Obama and that those were quite extraordinary circumstances having to do with our electing our first black president, and that no such extraordinary circumstances exist to favor anyone switching to Bernie now from Hillary&apos;s side.  Nichols knows that Hillary&apos;s super delegates are rock solid Hillary supporters who have appeared on stages across the country on her behalf through out the primary season and will never switch.  Nichols also ignores Bernie&apos;s destructive streak in this race, the real damage he is doing, the vanity of staying in the race, the foolishness of some of Bernie&apos;s objectively incorrect and dishonest claims about the math or the importance of polls.  
Why does Nichols persist?  It is hard to say.  He must know that such confections and fictions are candy to the Nation readership right now, that they are click-bait on-line, that the Nation readership is particularly fragile right now and resistant to more honest appraisals of Bernie&apos;s prospects, but he must also see that he is damaging his own reputation and the reputation of The nation with all this avoiding of reality.  Why isn&apos;t the nation starting to do the careful work of advocating for a graceful exit and crucial coming together of the losing campaign to support the winning campaign?  Why isn&apos;t Nichols asking more honest questions about  what can come next after such a huge Sanders defeat?

It&apos;s so sad, pathetic really, that Correct the Record trolls like Michael Curry, who come here to smear Bernie and insult John Nichols, believe that they are having some kind of positive effect on the readers. One million dollars is what David Brock of "Correct the Record" is spending for these kinds of damaging, insulting comments all over the internet. By the way, Michael Curry, please do not minimize the fact that it would be an extraordinary circumstance and very historic for the USA to elect our first Jewish president. Bernie&apos;s supporters are in this all the way to the convention and beyond!

Reading this [Michael Currier says:	
 May 12, 2016 at 7:58 am] now I know what "Tokyo Rose," was like during the second world war (the Japanese Imperial Army&apos;s psychological warfare radio broadcast program, targeting field soldiers.)

Fred:  having opinions about elections is suddenly akin to war-time propaganda against our loyal soldiers risking life and limb?  My, you certainly have an inflated sense of things.  Oh, how you&apos;ve suffered reading one opinion that goes against your thinking.

You are asking people to surrender to their oppressor.

OH my, the troll is back.

Leslie-  I am a reader of the nation, just like you.  I disagree with the article and so you get to reject that with name-calling.  But, still, he lost.  He lost badly.  Weeks ago.  that there still is a &apos;path&apos; or some crazy idea that he in some sense &apos;won&apos;, or that the &apos;revolution&apos; keeps going? those are all lies and fictions.  It&apos;d be so much more interesting if a magazine I love spoke of what really comes next, what really is possible instead of squeezing out more hyperbole about a battle that is lost.

Michael ! You are such a "party pooper"  don&apos;t you know: everyone love the underdog coming out from under; everybody loves an 11th hour upset;  Why are you trying to damper all the excitement and fun? 

You need to eat more organic fruits and vegetables.

He just won West Virginia by a YUUGE landslide!!

Well c&apos;mon, we are becoming overly focused on the specific personalities and their strengths and foibles (Sanders/ Clinton/ Trump/ et al). That&apos;s an understandable natural tendency, but it&apos;s clear to me that there is really a deeper issue in play; one that is independent of the particular persons. This is really a choice between ideological systems: the status quo that is working well for some (probably a minority at this point) versus something new, "revolutionary", and hopefully better for the many.

Clinton has certainly done everything right by the old playbook, and would deserve the nomination by those criteria (I almost feel sorry for her). Yet the seeming tidal wave of popularity of both Sanders and Trump (though they are opposites in most respects) suggests that perhaps a majority have lost faith in the status quo machine ever to deliver an adequate place at the table for average citizens. (At best, we&apos;re just the help.)

In my view, "incrementalism" is like teaching rapists to wear condoms. Yes, it&apos;s an improvement, butâ¦ On the other side, pulling the lever for Trump is really a vote for blowing up the System. Not sure I could do it but should Hillary be the nominee, I can understand why someone might want to.

It is easily feasible, that the Western States and New Jersey, etc. could get Sanders to a virtual tie (or beyond) with "The Clintons."  She is embarrassing herself and the Democratic Party, by reaching out to "moderate" Republicans for support against Trump, and assuming Sanders supporters for granted, too proud to explicitly, humbly, ask for help.  She is assuming coronation, which is likely to anger New Jersey and California Democratic and Independent voters (I&apos;m from Oregon, which will probably landslide for Sanders.)  Then there&apos;s N. & S. Dakota, Kentucky, and Montana.  All the kinds of States, the voters of which Sanders could easily landslide against "The Clintons" as a protest to her pandering to anti-Trump Republicans and their money. 

What also will be wearing her down in the voting public&apos;s eye is: (1) the "food fights" with Trump; (2) Clinton&apos;s "fait accompli" about she, herself, having already won the nomination; (3) Clinton&apos;s suggestions that Sanders supporters should surrender, and support "The Clintons," their super delegate machine, and the DLC "members only" party-within-the-party.

These developments and others could easily turn the political winds against her in the 11th hour.

Bernie Sanders will emerge as the only adult in the room.

I hope that the developments you describe will turn the political winds against Hillary. Bernie deserves to win. He has the best and most authentic agenda and a record so his proposals can be trusted. In fact, universal health care via single payer system is the least expensive way to deliver health care. Why does it take so much for both parties to see that this makes good business sense and embrace it? Clinton now favors a buy-in system into medicare for people around 50 to 55 years. It will make the medicare system into the same gothic quagmire that insurance company billing now is. All the more that it will be difficult to increase taxes on that age bracket but not on others to pay for it - or the proposal is just empty, the most likely outcome.

As to jobs, everybody trusts Trump more than Hillary. She is just too beholden to special interests - which is of course why she shuns a single payer health care system: she is paid by the insurance companies and has to further their profit. Though Bill Clinton created lots of jobs, she isn&apos;t Bill and circumstances are different now.

What everybody really wants is to get away from the hegemony wars abroad, austerity at home system. And Hillary is the epitome of that system. Trump agrees that the wars have to end so trade - fair trade - can revive. That is way more appealing than Hillary&apos;s Libya and more Libya destructions.

I for my part will vote for Trump if Bernie doesn&apos;t win rather than for Hillary. Or write in Bernie and accept that the vote doesn&apos;t count.

Regardless of the winner, it seems important to recognize Bernie&apos;s message has allowed him to attract non-Democratic voters.  It seems to go against a trend, noted since the early Reagan years, for white workers to vote against their own interests, supporting pro-business, anti-worker Republicans.  Globalization has displaced many of our country&apos;s manufacturing workers, who grew up in communities where unskilled laborers had, for a generation or two, nevertheless been able to make a decent living.  It isn&apos;t too hard to see how talk of white privilege would ring hollow for these people.  I can&apos;t ignore data which shows clearly women and people of color are disadvantaged.  However such facts don&apos;t alter the reality of struggling, often white, workers.

Good point but hard to verbalize, that is, to put into words.  One thing this primary taught us, is that Southern "Red-State" African-Americans are just as vulnerable to voting against their own interests, as are their conservative White-identity neighbors.  This vulnerability is driven by conservative rural-State religious and media establishments, along with neo-liberal, neo-conservative machine politics. (i.e.:  The ACA had a Medicaid opt-out "loophole" that hurt the poor - both the African-American-identity poor and the White-identity poor) who lost coverage. This working/poor health care loss occurred in neo-conservative/neo-liberal  States run by Republicans, who ideologically opposed the ACA.  The Democrats were in power, and they horse-traded-off the health care of our nation&apos;s poorest peoples, to get the ACA passed.

Without Sanders getting "equal air time" initially, at the start of the primaries, Southern delegate margins were greater for Clinton in the South, than anywhere else in the nation since.  Southerners  must have some "buyer&apos;s remorse."

I was glad Sanders entered the race. He pushed Clinton further to the left. But for the last few weeks he&apos;s shown his desperation. 
He always promised to talk about issues but, lately, he&apos;s been just short of trying to demonize Hillary. He speaks non-stop about her vote for the Iraq war--something that many Democrats did for political reasons. In her case, because she is a woman, she had to make the case that she&apos;s tough enough. Many Democrats besides Clinton have back-tracked because hindsight is perfect.
A woman called Thom Hartmann&apos;s radio show who claimed she is a Democrat voting for Trump because Hillary is a liar, a cheat and a murderer, among other things. She will not vote for Hillary because she murdered Vince Foster (It was proven that he committed suicide).
Sanders supporters show some poll numbers which show Sanders better able to beat Trump, but Sanders hasn&apos;t been demonized for 25 years like Hillary was. In fact, outside of Vermont, he was rarely heard from. He was a back-bencher who refused to compromise with Democrats whose party he switched to in order to run.
His motto was always that the good was the enemy of the perfect. If something was not perfect, he would vote no--unwilling to compromise. That&apos;s not how a two-party system can govern.
I&apos;m for Hillary because she&apos;s more likely to get things done. Bernie will be like the GOP who say NO to everything--compromise is not in his vocabulary. Trump and the rest of the GOP will tear him to shreds. They will equate socialism with communism.
He depends on a political revolution coming from the young: the young, who never vote. He can depend on them like in 2010 and 2014 when they failed to show up at the polls, thus insuring a Republican congress.
So you "Bernie or Nothing" diehards should stop backing a losing cause and stop demonizing Clinton, which may cause many Democrats and Independents to not vote. Then the election will go to Trump, who could possibly install 3 supreme court nominees. The court will then legitimize voter suppression, anti-abortion laws, gerrymandering and all the other horrific policies of the GOP.

Not a likely scenario. Hillary, while harassed by the Republicans, is also at fault for it herself to a good portion. Here political intrigues and dealings and her overkill in the destruction of Libya, Syria and her vote for Iraq make her in essence a war criminal. Yes, all recent presidents are war criminals. But that is just what people want to get out of: all these wars at the cost of $trillions while at home there are no services, infrastructure, schools. People drawing in debt to get a degree that if and maybe will secure a job. It is this system that people want to abolish. And that is precisely the system of Hillary. She is a corporate war politician, the same way that Obama is a corporate war and hegemony president. The few pieces of chocolate for the poor, now, 8 months before he leaves, are too little too late to be credible. In addition, his bestowing an award on Kissinger, the most murderous secretary of state ever - just to cover up Hillary - is disgusting. Kissinger should be in jail for war crimes and genocide. So should Obama. If it weren&apos;t for Russia who silently started to eradicate ISIS until they are now weakening, Obama would still be "containing" ISIS within Syria and Iraq to partition Iraq and fragment Syria - which is of course why Assad has to go. That stopped being possible when Putin convinced Assad to give up his CW. Giving up his deterrent meant also that Russia would defend Syria in order not to turn into a Libyan copy, where Qaddafi gave up his nuclear ambitions just to find himself being attacked by the US/NATO. The same is true for Iran. Russia and Iran signed extensive strategic and defense agreements to prevent exploitation of Iran having given up large portions of its enrichment work. Trump agrees with Russia on these issues. So does in principle Bernie. He too wants to stop the regime change wars. That is what will disadvantage Hillary in the general election against Trump. It would be way more difficult for Trump to win against Bernie, because Bernie&apos;s agenda is solidified with genuine social safety networks. Trump&apos;s isn&apos;t. Beyond that Trump and Bernie have many items in common.

EDDIE F Compromise on some issues, but never on corruption that is a Hillary trademark

This list of "I&apos;m with her" talking points was brought to you by Correct the Record. (Thank you, Eddie, you can pick up your check now.)

Sanders points out Hillary&apos;s record and policies for what they are, and if that seems to drive people away from her, then that&apos;s because people realize what a terrible record and policies she has! You are blaming Sanders for Hillary pushing fracking all around the world? Approving billions in arms sale to the Saudis who uses them to bomb civilians in Yemen? Her support of the Honduras coup that&apos;s now led the country to chaos and murder of environmental activists? Her flip flopping on TPP (which she will most likely flip again if and when she gets in power)? 

As for Sanders getting nothing done, please note he was the so called the amendment king - with a proven record of working with both Democrats and Republicans. By the way, you think the Republicans will roll over and work with Hillary? GET REAL.

"ï»¿ So you "Bernie or Nothing" diehards should stop backing a losing cause and stop demonizing Clinton, which may cause many Democrats and Independents to not vote."

A bit patronizing and without citation to authority. More likely and scary is the observation Nichols also makes that, "(e)ven among Democratic primary voters in West Virginia, roughly one-third indicated that they could back Trump in November."
So, we Bernie supporters should do... what, again?

Back Trump if Bernie loses! Once Trump is acknowledged as Republican candidate - when he has the necessary delegates, which is very soon - he will become a bit less exaggeratedly Republican and a bit more realistic as to what makes sense financially and for trade and wellbeing of Americans. That will be Hillary&apos;s downfall.

Clinton has NOT been nominated. You Hillbots are counting unhatched chickens.

Yes, it is a bit patronizing, but I don&apos;t apologize for the same reason that those who demonize Clinton do not apologize.
Citation? It&apos;s been talked about on TV and written in newspapers for a long time now. You seem like an intelligent person, so I&apos;m sure you know that without my having to cite chapter and verse.

I agree that the demonizing is over the top, but then again, I don&apos;t believe in even demonizing demons.   I spent a good number of hours in the mid 2000s doing lovingkindness meditation for George W. Bush.   So, no I don&apos;t hate Hillary, but I really have no desire to vote for her.   This is is primarily because of her militarist and corporatist  world views.  She&apos;s not bad on a slew of things, but the way she sees the world troubles me.

Clinton doesn&apos;t have to be "demonized" - she demonized herself, starting wars, installing dictators (for business interests) causing bloodshed, migration, and havoc across the globe.

"Best v. Good"... I researched this issue. I could not find Sanders&apos; ever saying that "the good was the enemy of the perfect" as a motto. The history of the quote you cite is obscure; Voltaire said, âThe best is the enemy of the goodâ, the other way around.  The meaning appears to be that striving for perfection is oftentimes a false god, when the lesser goal is the one more in consonance with human experience.  Especially in politics, where compromise, denigrated as a dirty word, is often the only way any progress towards "perfect" can obtain.

So Senator Sanders, aware of human shortcomings which we all share, has always said that the campaign is not about him. It is about attaining a goal that has, hitherto, not been reached: economic and political equality. It is on that anvil that this presidential campaign&apos;s sword must be beaten to become a plowshare for as many people as possible. Even Trump knows that. It&apos;s the rest of us (myself included) that have to re-calibrate our expectations and work to educate ourselves, then exercise the franchise right as best we can, individually, to obtain the "best result possible (good), not the best possible result  (perfect)".

aures lupi

Pardon me for not being clear. I was talking about his actions and speeches, which reflect that attitude. I didn&apos;t think I had to be so literal to an intelligent person like you.

The context that you seem to be missing is that the more Sanders hammers Clinton on the minimum wage, trade, health care,  and so on, the more she inches towards his positions.   

He would be insane at this point, with the leverage he has earned, to back off both because the more she adopts his positions the more electable she becomes, and because his positions are better for average working people and citizens of earth than hers. 

Finally, there are some issues on which compromise is not good enough, because the compromise solution is like putting a band-aid on a gaping gunshot wound. 

Accordingly,  I will vote for Clinton if she  adopts these three  Sanders stances  1) Truly universal publicly funded health care to replace the monstrosity of a system we have now.   2) keeping fossil fuels  in the ground  3) Ending the failed War on Drugs. 

Even then, it will be difficult to not assume she is shape shifting, and it will be also be difficult to overlook her hawkishness.  But, I&apos;d compromise.

Add to your list 4) Ending the hegemony/regime change wars. They have to go. Or there cannot be genuine betterment in the US: as long as the government spends trillions for wars, Americans will always be subjected to austerity. Which means no new infrastructure, no investment in better schools and teachers; no universal health care because that would leave the election sponsor insurance companies out; no banking reform - they make billions financing the wars; and no improvement in the economy.

She supported the coup in Honduras. If she needs to keep "proving" that she&apos;s as hawkish as a man, an iron lady, then why vote for her? I&apos;d have to vote for someone who&apos;s not in the position to prove her or himself. It&apos;s counterintuitive, but minorities sometimes feel they have to be "more popish than the pope himself" to maintain their "credentials." Not a good dynamic.

She was probably behind the Ukrainian coup, which installed a Billionaire businessman as President.  She was behind arming Saudi Arabia with a special $12 Billion in Plane and Bombs, etc. that killed thousands of innocent Yemeni mothers, fathers, and their children.  She bungled staging a violent "democratic revolution" instead, proliferating  arms in N. Africa, which have been acquired by anti-Western Jihadis, ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc.  She has shown no compassion for the suffering of indigenous people of Palestine, massacred by the right wing Zionists now controlling Israel, calling it "defending themselves."  In fact, both Trump and Sanders have shown more compassion to those forgotten in the West Bank and Gaza, than this "macho woman" has.

Entirely agree.

So your only choice is to vote for Trump. Good luck.

Trump is way less scary than Hillary who will want to prove herself as commander in chief in zillions of wars. Don&apos;t forget that NATO is already preparing war on Russia.

What

Sorry, iPad fooling around. What will you tell women who under Trump,WH have been promised punishment for abortion, although not their partners. Trump has promised Supreme Court which will throw out Roe v Wade. You really think Trump is adverse to war in spite of being best buds with Putin? Do you like the idea of a racist dictatorship?

I see political calculations as they are, rather than how I want them to be.  And yes, in the long term, it is my humble opinion that the two party system&apos;s dictatorship is evil and un-American, and both parties conspire against our true democracy.

As Sanders got a royal shaft by the illegitimate Democratic Party Machine with its filthy blood-stained money and the corporate media&apos;s bias, then a Trump victory might be the end of that evil DLC-Clinton-super-delegate dynasty, that began with Bill Clinton.

Four years of hell might be the price we must pay to free the Democratic Party after 24 years of bondage by the Clinton-DLC-super-delegate machine, and give it back to the people - notwithstanding the party unity against Trump expressed by Sanders. 

And your belief that a-socialist-is-viewed-as-a-communist is such obsolete nonsense that only an aging, low-information voter would still believe that "20th century" stuff.  I bet you once thought a black man with a Moslem last name that rhymes with "Osama" could never be elected President either.

Personally,  if Sanders gets screwed, as usual, I don&apos;t see much difference between Clinton or Trump.  I would vote for neither, and wouldn&apos;t care who wins.

I prefer Bernie, too but if you don&apos;t see much difference between Clinton and Trump your anti-government cynicism has rendered you delusional. You really think it wouldn&apos;t matter and you wouldn&apos;t care? I don&apos;t think Bernie Sanders would agree with you.

Bernie has to support the Democratic party which he wants to reform - if his demands are accepted, they will limit Hillary. Which means they won&apos;t likely be accepted. Which leaves only Trump as a president who will get America back on its feet by stopping the meaningless wars for hegemony and instead use the money to rebuild the infrastructure and create jobs for all.

You are clearly delusional and engaged in wishful thinking. What makes you so sure Trump is the answer to your dreams?

And, by the way, Trump now refers to Bernie Sanders as Crazy Bernie Sanders.

I amnot delusionalbecause I base my opinions on fact.  You are in denial if you don&apos;t see as many flaws in Clinton&apos;s record of actions, some clandestine, as you see in Trump&apos;s abrasive rhetoric.

And furthermore, you got at least one of your facts wrong. The super-delegates were created after the bitter 1980 primary between Senator Edward Kennedy and President Jimmy Carter. It didn&apos;t start with Bill Clinton.

But the Clinton&apos;s built out the system into a "machine" for their purposes.

That&apos;s questionable, as if they acted alone.

And furthermore, you got at least one of your facts wrong. The super-delegates were created back in 1980 after the bitter primary fight between Senator Edward Kennedy and President Jimmy Carter. It didn&apos;t start with Bill Clinton.

Just because you think you base your opinions on fact doesn&apos;t make you right. You make it sound like HRC is some diabolical mastermind behind evil government actions. 
 Bernie himself has said that even if he doesn&apos;t win the nomination he will do everything in his power to prevent Trump from becoming the president. So, he has already stated that he disagrees with you.

Sanders is our leader, not our master.  I knew I should have checked with Wikipedia, but Clinton may have been the first Democrat to benefit from super delegates.
From Wikipedia:  "The DLC hailed President Bill Clinton as proof of the viability of Third Way politicians and as a DLC success story." If Clinton is the nominee, Trump will win.  Sanders has said something like, "Defeating Trump is what he and Clinton agree on."  I think you misquoted Sanders.  He never talks about what he will do, or who he will support "if he doesn&apos;t win."  Those are your words.  Clinton is a creep and half the country knows it.  According to her,  poor little old Bernie needs to apologize to mothers of massacred  children at Sandy Hook, because he contributed to their deaths?  A she-devil?  I&apos;ll say.  And  a dirty campaigner too.

I didn&apos;t quote Sanders at all. I paraphrased what I heard him say.

You mean if Clinton is the nominee you want Trump to win. You are likely, and hopefully, wrong.

Do you live in a bubble, Eddie?  Do you not see that Clinton and Trump are bickering like Trump did with Cruz or Rubio, over proverbial "hand size" issues.  There is a good chance, that, before the primary/convention is over, the Democratic Party, warts and all, will give the nomination to Sanders, with or without those hideous super [patronizing] delegates support, because the polls will show  Clinton losing in the general election, to a "new, improved" Trump.  If they cannot foresee this happening, and react accordingly, the political dynamics will have it that Trump will win.

Trump is way less evil than Hillary and way less frightening than a Hillary presidency. Hillary is a corporate war monger for her own wealth. She has no qualms to kill millions of people for her own power trip.

Yes, I live in a bubble--a different one than the one you live in.

Again, vote for Trump.

I think that the underlying psychology for a lot of people (me included) is something like this:  The Democratic establishment wants us to vote Democrat because the alternative is so bad.  But, why should we be scared, shamed and bullied into voting for the candidate who we don&apos;t support because the alternative is the insane orange twelve year old?    Look, we don&apos;t want him anymore than you do, but really, what difference does it make?  I mean, I know it makes some difference, Supreme Court yadda yadda, but, does it really matter?   Like, does it really really matter?  We voted for Bill and Barrack, and still, what have they done about climate change?  Where&apos;s a sane health care system?  What have they done to downsize the military, end the war on drugs?   Well, Obama, did some things, kind of,  and he&apos;s not a bad guy, but he didn&apos;t FIGHT like Bernie fights.  We want a fighter, a champion, a prize fighter in the ring.  And anyway, what does Hillary really believe?  What does she value?  What is her foundational moral vision?    I just don&apos;t know because she&apos;s so into the military it seems, and also, she things corporations can have their cake and eat it too.   Fuck it.  I&apos;m writing in Bernie.

Vote for Trump. His agenda is very similar to Bernie&apos;s minus the strong social safety network. But even Trump wants to invest money into schools and education. Even Trump wants to stop the hegemony wars and regime change destabilization wars. So trade can take place. Without TPP and TTIP, NAFTA andCAFTA as they are, but with free and fair trade agreements that benefit both sides equally. There is nothing saner than that. In addition, the GOP has treated Trump so badly, he doesn&apos;t owe them anything and can really do the way he wants once he has the delegates and that is just a matter of the next primaries.

I want to know more about the unreported 13% of the vote.  Were other candidate(s) on the printed ballots?  Were they all write-ins?  What is their relationship to the West Virginia DNC?  I hope you can let us know.

I wondered about that too. How come the votes don&apos;t add up to 100%? It seems that have been a good many  -too many - voting irregularities.

To all who will vote for Hillary as the lesser of two evils, please read: "Listen, Liberal" by Thomas Frank.  She may indeed be the lesser evil, but I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT IS THAT THEY ARE VOTING FOR!!!!!!!!!

Yes, the lesser of two evils is STILL evil.

I want someone from the Nation to follow up on Bill Clinton&apos;s behind closed doors smoozing every New York State legislator to make sure they vote for the TPP. Hillary is temporally saying she is kinda against it, but I don&apos;t know how anyone can believe what what she says. She is liar. Having Bill Clinton back in the white house is very scary. You can get more details about this from those working in the groups fighting the TPP, and they can confirm that Bill Clinton is doing the work on his wife&apos;s behalf. He will make sure the TPP is passed.

For the Clinton&apos;s its good: it means millions for their coffers. Plus a step in US dominance over the world.

Yes, the TPP helps keep the disaster economics in play. Which is what keeps the money flowing through the Clinton Fountdation. A foundation whose business model is based on disaster economics- the distruction of places like Haiti, the Clinton Founation then accepts donations and says it will help out Haiti. It never really does and keeps laudering money through the foundation. A viscous cycle and the Clintons feed off of it.

Hear! Hear!

Why does no one, no media explain the math disparity... that 51 and 36 do not a 100% make!!  I thought at least your publication might mention it--A West Virginia attorney and Democrat running in protest, Paul T Farrell Jr, received almost 9% and other candidates the rest of the missing 13%.  Thanks for such a bad job of reporting

NY Times&apos; delegate count has 16 for Sanders, 11 for Clinton.  That makes 27.  Where did the other 2 delegates go?  There are 29 delegates in W. Virginia.

Thank you, John Nichols! While so many "journalists" have fallen far from the standard of their profession during this election season, you have always managed to keep your integrity through telling the truth!

Love you John, as long as you keep saying "If" Clinton wins, and she "nearly" has the delegates to win, and as long as you imply Sanders can still win.

 The media "game over" blitz [in favor of Clinton] is making many people nauseous.  This is obviously done to promote apathy among Sanders hopefuls.

It may indeed backfire (with revenge instead of apathy) as those last of the primary voters will feel as if they are being perceived as insignificant by The Clinton Machine and will rebel by voting for Sander.
