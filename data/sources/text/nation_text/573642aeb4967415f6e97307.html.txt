I donât believe Donald Trump can actually pivot to a run a centrist, dignified campaignâone that will make him look âpresidential,â as his advisers have promised. But heâll probably try, and itâs on the media to point out all the inconsistencies that would entail.Â I donât have a lot of faith in the media, so I expect a general-election campaign between Trump and Hillary Clinton to be closer than it should be. We had a small foreshadowing of the problem on Thursday, when Trump recanted his earlier stands on tax cuts and the minimum wage, but got much more attention forÂ an idiotic, borderline-racist tweet about tacos and Cinco de Mayo. By the end of the day, the media’s storyline was “Trump, Clinton spar over tacos.”

Trumpâs tax-policy paper, released last September, isÂ actually the most detailed plan he has put out during theÂ campaign so far. It isÂ big. It isÂ brash. It addsÂ $9.5 trillion to the deficit. It cuts taxes for the top .1 percent by an average of $1.3 million. When he announced the plan, Trump defended those tax cuts for the rich:Â âI fight like hell to pay as little as possible,âÂ he told reporters.		
Now, apparently, someone has told him that a vocal chunk of his base consists of angry, white, working-class men, and so Trump, for a day at least, ditched his own tax plan like it was an aging supermodel girlfriend. âI am not necessarily a huge fan of that,â he said. (âThatâ being his own plan, mind you.) âI am so much more into the middle class who have just been absolutely forgotten in our country.â		
Likewise, Trump seemed to reverse himself on the minimum wage on Wednesday night. At a November debate he declared, âI hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,â adding that âtaxes are too high, wages too high, weâre not going to be able to compete against the world.â But the day he became the presumptive GOP nominee, he told CNN he was open to a hike. âI’m looking at that, I’m very different from most Republicans.â

This is Trumpâs version of the Etch-a-Sketch moment Mitt Romneyâs advisors promised in 2012âthe point at which the nominee can ease up on the hard-right stands he took to win the nomination, and present a moderate persona for the general election. It didnât work for Romneyâactually, Romney never really made the pivot. Will it work for Trump?		
With a little help from the media, it might.		
For most of Thursday, cable news-beat reportersÂ did note the contradiction between GOP-primary Trump and new general-election Trump on the minimum wage and tax cut. But both issues were overshadowed by Trumpâs moronic âI love Hispanicsâ taco-bowl tweet, which dominated the afternoon news cycle. Yes, it was mostly mocked; a BuzzFeed reporter attempted to debunk Trumpâs claim that Trump Grill served taco bowlsâit doesnâtâbut it turned out to have come from Trump CafÃ© in the same building. Trump probably doesnât deserve any Pinocchios for that; he deserves scorn and revulsion for trying to do âHispanicâ outreach with a taco-bowl tweet on Cinco de Mayo, especially given the ugly things he has said about undocumented Mexican immigrants.

When Hillary Clinton herself tried to point out that irony, though, she got into a little trouble with the media. HerÂ tweetÂ paired âI love Hispanics!â with a past Trump threat: âTheyâre gonna be deported.â Fox News Latino accused Clinton of âpandering,â while wags on social media complained that sheâd implied all âHispanicsâ are undocumented. CNN ran a segment that was headlinedÂ âTrump, Clinton spar over tacos.â Because #bothsides.

This is just a small example of the big problem Voxâs David Roberts outlined in a brilliant and worrisome piece yesterday âWhy the media will lift Trump up, and tear Clinton down.â It makes some of the same points I highlightedâthe political media is invested in a horse race, and many donât like Clintonâbut with more specificity about how the process is likely to unfold:		
The US political ecosystemâmedia, consultants, power brokers, think tanks, foundations, officeholders, the whole thick network of institutions and individuals involved in national politicsâcannot deal with a presidential election in which one candidate is obviously and uncontroversially the superior (if not sole acceptable) choice. The machine is simply not built to handle a race that’s over before it’s begun.		
There are entire classes of professionals whose jobs are premised on the model of two roughly equal sides, clashing endlessly.Â  
We donât have such a raceâby any standard, Clinton is eminently more qualified to be president than Trump, who would be a disaster domestically and on the world stage. But once GOP leaders begin to close ranks around Trump, he will be normalized, and the âpolitical ecosystemâ can return to its comfortable stasis. âThere will be a tidal pull to normalize this election, to make it Coca-Cola versus Pepsi instead of Coca-Cola versus sewer water,â Roberts observes, and heâs right. The only way to do that though, is to exaggerate Clintonâs (very real) flaws.		
Roberts asks (rhetorically):		
Will the Washington press corps chase after ridiculous personal attacks and conspiracy theories regarding Hillary Clinton, whispered into their ears by right-wing hacks?		
And answers (correctly):		
Ha ha. Have youÂ metÂ the Washington press corps? They have been doing that since the early 1990s, Clinton rulesÂ mean guilty until proven innocent, then and now. The Washington media is a machine that transforms crap about Clintons into headlines, and Trump is a bottomless supply of crap.		
Thursdayâs taco controversy was a (relatively trivial) microcosm of how it will all work. Trumpâs Taco tweet revealed his stupendous racist ignoranceâbut media notions of âfairnessâ required that reporters note that Clintonâs tweet had issues, too. AndÂ so by the end of the day, the whole entertaining mess can be headlined âTrump, Clinton spar over tacosââand we can forget aboutÂ the news that Trump flip-flopped on the minimum wage and tax cuts.		
Itâs going to be a long campaign.

AndÂ so by the end of the day, the whole entertaining mess can be headlined âTrump, Clinton spar over tacosââand we can forget aboutÂ the news that Trump flip-flopped on the minimum wage and tax cuts.		
Itâs going to be a long campaign.		
		

With a little help from the media, it might.		
For most of Thursday, cable news-beat reportersÂ did note the contradiction between GOP-primary Trump and new general-election Trump on the minimum wage and tax cut. But both issues were overshadowed by Trumpâs moronic âI love Hispanicsâ taco-bowl tweet, which dominated the afternoon news cycle. Yes, it was mostly mocked; a BuzzFeed reporter attempted to debunk Trumpâs claim that Trump Grill served taco bowlsâit doesnâtâbut it turned out to have come from Trump CafÃ© in the same building. Trump probably doesnât deserve any Pinocchios for that; he deserves scorn and revulsion for trying to do âHispanicâ outreach with a taco-bowl tweet on Cinco de Mayo, especially given the ugly things he has said about undocumented Mexican immigrants.

This is just a small example of the big problem Voxâs David Roberts outlined in a brilliant and worrisome piece yesterday âWhy the media will lift Trump up, and tear Clinton down.â It makes some of the same points I highlightedâthe political media is invested in a horse race, and many donât like Clintonâbut with more specificity about how the process is likely to unfold:		
The US political ecosystemâmedia, consultants, power brokers, think tanks, foundations, officeholders, the whole thick network of institutions and individuals involved in national politicsâcannot deal with a presidential election in which one candidate is obviously and uncontroversially the superior (if not sole acceptable) choice. The machine is simply not built to handle a race that’s over before it’s begun.		
There are entire classes of professionals whose jobs are premised on the model of two roughly equal sides, clashing endlessly.Â  
We donât have such a raceâby any standard, Clinton is eminently more qualified to be president than Trump, who would be a disaster domestically and on the world stage. But once GOP leaders begin to close ranks around Trump, he will be normalized, and the âpolitical ecosystemâ can return to its comfortable stasis. âThere will be a tidal pull to normalize this election, to make it Coca-Cola versus Pepsi instead of Coca-Cola versus sewer water,â Roberts observes, and heâs right. The only way to do that though, is to exaggerate Clintonâs (very real) flaws.		
Roberts asks (rhetorically):		
Will the Washington press corps chase after ridiculous personal attacks and conspiracy theories regarding Hillary Clinton, whispered into their ears by right-wing hacks?		
And answers (correctly):		
Ha ha. Have youÂ metÂ the Washington press corps? They have been doing that since the early 1990s, Clinton rulesÂ mean guilty until proven innocent, then and now. The Washington media is a machine that transforms crap about Clintons into headlines, and Trump is a bottomless supply of crap.

Obviously the thing for the S.S. Clintonista Condescension is to ignore Bernie. And it&apos;s laughable that Joan Walsh  would whine and moan about the media after herself appearing repeatedly with Chris (Roy Cohn jr.) Matthews, demonizing Senator Sanders with Joe McCarthy type  shouts of "Socialist!! Socialist!!" while Matthews&apos; wife had the same donors as Clinton in her recent Congressional run.  What a joke.

What&apos;s the incentive to running on the issues that impact lives?  You just saw Trump decimate sixteen candidates vying for the Republican nomination for President by avoiding specifics like the plague. The media has sold out for readers and ratings.

Obiberniewan, you are our only hope!

Did I miss something? I thought Bernie was still running. Let&apos;s talk a

To present Trump anything other than the buffoon that he is, is elevating him to a statesman. But as Joan Walsh and David Roberts very rightly point out, tearing down the Clintons and pronouncing them guilty until proven innocent, has been a full time US political ecosystem job since the early 1990s. Difference is, this time, it  might bring the whole country down, if it continues providing legitimacy for this American version of Berlusconi!

Seems inevitable that he&apos;ll be "normalized," so let them go ahead and build him up into what he seems to want: the last champion of the Macho White Male. Then women voters can go Kapow! on his pudgy, moronic phizz.
