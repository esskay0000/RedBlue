The John Batchelor Show, May 10.

Nation contributing editor Stephen F. Cohen and John Batchelor continue their weekly discussions of the new US-Russian Cold War. (Previous installments are at TheNation.com). This installment focuses on Putin’s policies at home and abroad since he became Russia’s leader in 2000. Cohen argues that a factual and balanced evaluation is of vital importance because the demonization of Putin personally, which indicts him for most everything from ripping apart the world order to murdering his personal opponents, is the central element in the orthodox American political-media narrative of the new Cold War that is leading increasingly to the possibility of actual war between the United States and Russia.		
Cohen itemizes what might otherwise be considered Putin’s achievements at home and aboard—pluses—but which are omitted from the demonizing narrative. At home, they include stabilizing a Russia laden with weapons of mass destruction and on the verge of disintegration in 2000 and improving in many tangible ways the well-being of the great majority of the Russian people. (For example, per capita income, social benefits, longevity, and birth rates are up; infant deaths and suicides are down.) If Russia’s democratization has meanwhile been diminished, Cohen reminds listeners that democratization began in Soviet Russia under Mikhail Gorbachev and its reversal began under the first post-Soviet President, Boris Yeltsin, though Putin may be criticized for continuing the latter process.		
Putin’s pluses abroad, especially those abetting US policy, also are not credited. They include important Russian assistance to Washington’s war against the Taliban in Afghanistan after 9/11, which saved American lives; Putin’s vital role in bringing about the destruction of Syrian President Assad’s chemical weapons in 2013; his instrumental role in achieving the 2015 agreement that limited Iran’s nuclear weapons capability; and most recently Russia’s contributions to major military defeats of the Islamic State in Syria in 2015–16. Cohen adds a special issue that has plagued American-Russian relations for decades, if not centuries: Russian anti-Semitism. Many Russian Jews and Israelis say today, “Putin is the best friend Jews and Israel have ever had in the Kremlin.”		
Finally, Cohen turns to the major demonizing accusation: Putin has pursued “aggressive policies” abroad for 16 years or at least since the US-Russian proxy war in Georgia in 2008. Reviewing the history of US-Russian relations since 2000, Cohen concludes that Putin has been less an “aggressive” foreign policy leader than a reactive leader, as is often complained in Moscow. Looking at the ongoing major US-NATO military buildup (on land, sea, and in the air) on or near Russia’s borders, Cohen asks: Who is “aggressing” against whom, and who is mostly reacting?

If you haven&apos;t heard the wonderful, illustrated lecture by U. Chicago&apos;s Prof. John Mearsheimer entitled, "The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine Crisis", don&apos;t miss it:

He argues very convincingly that it is the West (i.e. the U.S.) that is the aggressor in Ukraine, not Putin).

Important points, Dr. Cohen. One of the reasons for the demonization of Putin is of course that he found out very fast that the sarin attack in Syria was committed by the rebels. He also had the greatest interest in knowing who did it: had it been Assad, he would have been double crossed by an ally and that would have put the entire plan to intervene in Syria - i.e. to defend Assad from any exploitation of Assad giving up CW&apos;s -  in question. The US is muff because Assad giving up his CW&apos;s also means that the Assad has to go mantra is void. Similarly, Russia&apos;s intervention on behalf of Assad against ISIS crossed the US plan to use ISIS to partition Iraq and fragment Syria as a means to divide the crescent of resistance against terrorism from Lebanon (Hezbollah), Syria, Iran and Iraq and get control of the Levant and EU gas market via Qatari gas pipeline and US export of fracked gas. Because Russia weakened ISIS and is now approaching Raqqa, the US has no other choice anymore but to genuinely fight ISIS to restore Iraq to its former size. In addition, Putin insisted that the Geneva agreements preserve Syria in its geopolitical boundaries as recorded with the UN - i.e. as before the war. That in essence undercuts the entire foreign policy of the US and Israel. Meanwhile Russia didn&apos;t take the baits to fight a war against NATO in either Syria or Ukraine. IN Ukraine, Crimea clearly is and will remain Russia. Which means, the US lost the cherry of the putsch which clearly envisioned ousting Russia from Sewastopol and replacing the Russian base and fleet with an American/NATO base and fleet. Donbas remains in limbo, which means Ukraine cannot join NATO due to unresolved border issues. The only way at this point how Ukraine can get control of its border is if it implements the Minsk accords, i.e. federate Ukraine to give autonomy within Ukraine to Donbas, which will also prevent Ukraine form joining NATO. Since at this point the US has no other choice but to go along with Russian peace initiatives, it gets hidden behind demonization of Putin, absurd weapons and military buildup along Russian&apos;s borders with the EU and endless howls of Russian aggression and danger. While that looks like a buildup to a war on Russia, it depends on who is the next president. If it is Trump, he may well undo this buildup to restore peaceful relations with Russia and restructure NATO as a peacekeeping force and to fight terrorism - just what Putin suggested many times.
