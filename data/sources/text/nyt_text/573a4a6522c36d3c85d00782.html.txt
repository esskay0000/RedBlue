WASHINGTON â A rift between environmentalists and labor, two pillars of the Democratic coalition, broke open acrimoniously on Monday, when a group of big unions threatened to boycott an ambitious get-out-the-vote operation planned for the November election unless a wealthy opponent of climate change was barred from it.

Warning that organized labor risked being âinfiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflictâ with their members, the presidents of seven building-trade unions demanded that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. cut its ties with Thomas F. Steyer, a hedge fund manager who has spent millions promoting efforts to combat climate change.

In a blistering letter to Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., they demanded that the federation back off plans to create a joint âsuper PACâ with Mr. Steyer, founder of the political advocacy group NextGen Climate.

Seeking to increase their political clout, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a group of unions, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the two main teachersâ unions, said last week that they would join forces with Mr. Steyer to finance efforts to help Democratic candidates this fall through a new group called For Our Future PAC. The goal was for liberal groups to avoid duplicating efforts, as has happened in some elections.

Some unions were asked to give as much as $1 million. Mr. Steyer said that he would give $5 million and that it was âhighly likelyâ other unions would join the effort, with an initial goal of raising $50 million.

However, the construction-sector unions assailed the A.F.L.-C.I.O.âs willingness to make common cause with Mr. Steyer â who has opposed projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and coal-fired power plants â as an abandonment of workers and the federationâs principles.

âIt saddens us that the very labor movement we have fought for and supported for over a century seems to have lost sight of its core mission and has moved away from us and our membership in the interest of headline-grabbing political expediency,â wrote the union presidents. The letter was signed by leaders of the operating engineers, plumbers, elevator constructors, roofers, laborers, plasterers and heat and frost insulators. Many of them have members who would stand to gain if the sort of energy projects Mr. Steyer has opposed went forward.

In a separate and even more harshly worded letter to Mr. Trumka, the president of the 500,000-member laborers union, Terry OâSullivan, called the partnership a âpolitically bankrupt betrayalâ of union members. âWe object to the political agenda of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,â he wrote.

The letters were provided to The New York Times by a labor official who insisted on anonymity.

The schism comes as Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is running a populist campaign that could appeal to some union members, castigating free trade agreements and illegal immigrants while vowing not to cut entitlement spending.

Climate change advocates have enjoyed rising influence on the left in recent years.

But hard-hat unions, already on edge after President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, sided with the environmentalists on Keystone, are furious to see other labor leaders linking arms with someone they hold responsible for blocking job-creating projects.

The tensions come as membership in most private-sector unions has steadily declined, leaving organized labor under pressure to find new ways to demonstrate its influence.

Mr. OâSullivan, in his letter, zeroed in on this challenge.

âYears of financial distress have left the A.F.L.-C.I.O. desperate for cash, and it appears that the answer is to sell out to a billionaire who not only has little or no stake in our movement, our members or their work but who has actively fought against our membersâ interest,â he wrote.
