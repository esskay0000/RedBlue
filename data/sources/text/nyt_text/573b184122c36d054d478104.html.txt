Thrown chairs. Leaked cellphone numbers. Death threats spewed across the Internet.

No, this is not the work of Donald J. Trump supporters, some of whom have harassed critics of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. It was angry supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders who were directing their ire at the Nevada Democratic Party â and its chairwoman, Roberta Lange â over a state convention on Saturday that they think was emblematic of a rigged political system.

âItâs been vile,â said Ms. Lange, who riled Sanders supporters by refusing their requests for rule changes at the event in Las Vegas. âItâs been threatening messages, threatening my family, threatening my life, threatening my grandchild.â

The vicious response has come as millions of new voters, many of whom felt excluded by establishment politicians, have flocked to the insurgent campaigns of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has all but locked up the nomination, but many backers of Mr. Sanders remain enraged as his hopes of being the Democratic candidate dwindle.

Although Hillary Clinton won the Nevada caucuses in February, the Sanders campaign worked hard to win delegates at county conventions and was hopeful that it could emerge from the state with an equal number of delegates or more. But the state convention, held at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel, deteriorated into chaos after nearly 60 of Mr. Sandersâs potential delegates were deemed ineligible amid a dispute over the rules. The convention concluded abruptly after security staff no longer felt it could ensure the safety of the participants, many of whom were yelling and throwing things.

Though the raucous Republican nominating fight was the one that appeared to be careering toward a contested convention, the drawn-out fight on the Democratic side has emerged as an ugly intraparty feud in its own right, threatening hopes for unity ahead of the July convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Sanders faces a virtually insurmountable delegate deficit, but has pledged to carry on his campaign despite the long odds.

Mr. Sanders has promised, if he is not the nominee, to help defeat Mr. Trump, and even though he has scaled back his attacks against Mrs. Clinton he still asserts that he would be a better general election candidate. The Sanders campaign is still fighting vigorously for every delegate that remains on the table, and his supporters have shown little sign of warming to his opponent.

âWhat Nevada shows is the kindling is there,â Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist, said of the energy within Mr. Sandersâs base of support. âThe question is, what is he going to do with it?â

The backlash against Ms. Lange in Nevada echoes what happened in Colorado last month when supporters of Mr. Trump bombarded Steve House, the chairman of the State Republican Party, with complaints of disenfranchisement. He received thousands of calls after his cellphone number was disseminated online.

Supporters of Mr. Sanders used similar tactics to exert pressure on Ms. Lange, who has received more than 1,000 calls since Saturday night and as many as three text messages per minute. The threats, which came from men and women from across the country, were haunting and personal.

âLoved how you broke the system,â one person wrote in a text message that said he or she knew where Ms. Langeâs grandchildren went to school. âPrepare for hell. Calls wonât stop.â

Another person left a voice mail message saying he thought Ms. Lange should be âhung in public executionâ for her actions.

âIâm scared for my family,â Ms. Lange said. âScared for my kids.â

Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said the Vermont senator did not condone violence of any kind. However, he said the campaign was still determining whether it would challenge the Nevada results.

âThe senator believes that the Democratic Party all over the country would serve its own interests better if it were to figure out a way to welcome people who have been energized and excited by his campaign into the party,â Mr. Briggs said. âIt would behoove the party to be more welcoming and engage those people.â

The Democratic National Committee is hoping that what happened in Las Vegas stays there and that the prospect of Mr. Trumpâs winning the presidency brings the party together in time for the July convention.

âWeâre confident that Democrats will be united and energized at our convention and throughout the general election,â said Mark Paustenbach, a committee spokesman. âOur candidates have each said they will work hard to make sure that Donald Trump and his dangerous and divisive policies never set foot in the Oval Office.â
