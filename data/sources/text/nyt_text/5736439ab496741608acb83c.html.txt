During the same week in November that an obscure New York City agency lifted a protective covenant on a nursing home on the Lower East Side â an alteration that is now the subject of at least three inquiries â a similar move was playing out in Harlem.

Few people knew that the agency, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, had accepted $875,000 in exchange for lifting a deed restriction, in place since 1976, that required a corner lot at St. Nicholas Avenue and 152nd Street to be used only by nonprofit cultural organizations in the area.

Neighbors who learned about the change after the fact feared that the lot, owned by the Dance Theater of Harlem, would soon end up in the hands of developers. What they did not know, at that point, was that a developer who made a financial contribution to one of Mayor Bill de Blasioâs political causes was already in contract to buy the property. The developer, BRP Companies, closed on the sale last month for $3.1 million.

The process by which the deed restriction on the unremarkable but nonetheless valuable Harlem parcel was lifted in many ways mirrors the one involving the Lower East Side nursing home, known as Rivington House.

The decision to amend the nursing home deed, for $16 million, is being investigated by Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general; the cityâs comptroller, Scott M. Stringer; and the cityâs Department of Investigation.

The transactions in Harlem are likely to face new scrutiny. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has said he was unaware of the Rivington House deal and ordered a review of the process for removing such deed restrictions imposed by the city. The head of the administrative services agency is scheduled to testify at a City Council budget hearing on Friday. And the Council is planning a separate hearing on deed restrictions in the coming weeks.

As little public notice as there was for the contentious deal on the Lower East Side, which resulted in a developer of luxury condominiums buying the nursing home property in February for $116 million, the decision to remove all restrictions on the Harlem property got even less.

The local community board was not informed. Neither was the local councilman, Mark Levine, or the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer. A notice of a public hearing appeared on a back page of the City Record for a single day in April 2015. No one showed up at the hearing to testify.

âWe found out after it was lifted by just looking up the deed,â said April Tyler, chairwoman of the community boardâs land use committee. âI think this is worth highlighting and investigating.â

According to a person familiar with the matter, the city has been in talks with BRP Companies, which builds both market-rate and below-market-rate housing, about putting around two dozen affordable units on the Harlem parcel. It was not clear when those conversations took place or if they played a role in the decision to lift the deed restriction, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the active inquiries into deed changes.

A developer would need city approval, and would have to include affordable units in its plans, if it wanted to pursue a rezoning of the property to allow for the construction of a larger building than is currently allowed there.

BRP Companies went into contract to buy the lot in May 2015. Months earlier, in October 2014, it had contributed $10,000 through a company it controls to the Putnam County Democratic Committee, a donation that coincided with a push that year by Mr. de Blasio and his allies to use local county committees as vehicles for supporting Democrats in tight State Senate races. The Manhattan district attorneyâs office and the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York are now investigating whether the tactic resulted in violations of election law.

Asked last month about the donation, Meredith Marshall, a founder of the firm, said he could not recall who had asked him to contribute, though he said it was not someone from Mr. de Blasioâs administration. Mr. Marshall has occasionally appeared in mayoral news releases, providing quotes supportive of housing initiatives.

In response to questions about the Harlem lot, the administration provided a one-line statement from Lisette Camillo, commissioner of the administrative services agency: âThe city is in the process of reviewing its policy on the lifting of deed restrictions.â

City officials are also exploring whether the administrative services department had the authority to lift the restriction on the Harlem deed, which was imposed nearly 40 years ago by the Board of Estimate, which had many of the powers of todayâs City Council.

In most cases, if a land-use decision made by the Board of Estimate is to be changed, the revision must be approved by the City Planning Commission or, in some cases, by the Council itself.

Barry Weinberg, another member of the local community board, questioned how the decision on the deed had been arrived at.

âThereâs huge concern and thereâs massive frustration: Why was this deed restriction lifted?â he said. âWhen people change the rules of the game outside of public view, it creates problems,â he said, adding that the process should be transparent and should involve community board members and other local leaders. âIt shouldnât be nonprofits removing it for a fee and flipping it for a big payout.â

Deed restrictions, on parcels of land formerly owned by the city, are rarely removed. There have been at least nine instances of such restrictions being modified or removed since Mr. de Blasio took office. In several cases, the city accepted no money for the change, choosing instead to impose new restrictions. The price fetched by the Harlem lot appears to be the second highest, after Rivington House.

The lot also benefited from special zoning. When the City Council changed the zoning rules in 2012 for the neighborhood, a fast-gentrifying section of Harlem, the local councilman at the time obtained an exemption for the Dance Theater of Harlem that allowed for construction of greater height and density on the empty lot than in the surrounding area.

The councilman, Robert Jackson, said he requested the exemption because the nonprofit said it wanted to build student housing; no one mentioned an eventual sale of the property. âI would have never agreed to do that,â he said, âbecause it doesnât make sense.â

But even with the special zoning, the restriction on the deed â for ânonprofit use by a community-service-type organization offering cultural services to the communityâ â limited the value of the property.

It was not clear how long the Dance Theater of Harlem, which has struggled financially, had been in negotiations with the city to lift the restriction. The groupâs executive director, Anna Glass, referred questions to the board chairman, Michael D. Armstrong, who did not respond to a request for comment.

No construction permits have yet been filed with the city for the lot. Mr. Marshall suggested last month that the absence of a state subsidy might prevent the company from building affordable housing in some cases. He did not respond to a request for comment for this article; emails and phone messages to BRP Companies were not returned.

Ms. Tyler, of the local community board, said that market-rate apartments were most likely in store for the lot. âThey can build whatever they want,â she said, adding that the neighborhood has become a lucrative housing market. âI do not think that the developer would willingly put affordable housing up in that area.â
