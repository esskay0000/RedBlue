Delbert L. Latta, who as a Republican congressman from Ohio was a major legislative advocate of President Ronald Reaganâs economic policies, died on Thursday in Bowling Green, Ohio. He was 96.

His death was confirmed by Allison Poulios, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lattaâs son, Bob Latta, who represents the same Fifth Congressional District, in northwestern Ohio, that his father represented for 30 years.

Delbert Latta, who was the top Republican on the House Budget Committee before he retired from Congress in 1989, was the author or co-sponsor of various pieces of federal legislation. He joined with Representative Phil Gramm of Texas in writing the Gramm-Latta budget bill in 1981 and the Gramm-Latta Omnibus Reconciliation bill, which helped advance the Reagan administrationâs economic agenda.

In the early 1970s, during the Watergate hearings, he was a member of the House Judiciary Committee.

Delbert Leroy Latta was born on March 5, 1920, in Weston, Ohio. He was educated in the state, attending public schools in North Baltimore, Findlay College (now the University of Findlay) and Ohio Northern University, where he received an undergraduate degree in government and a law degree. He served in the Ohio National Guard and the Army from 1938 to 1941 and in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1942 to 1943.

Mr. Latta was practicing law and teaching at Ohio Northern when he ran successfully for the Ohio Senate in 1952. He served there until 1958, when he won the Fifth Congressional District seat.

When he retired, he was the dean of the Ohio congressional delegation. His son was elected to the House to fill an open seat in 2007.
