Nine Republican chairmen of U.S. House committees endorsed Donald Trump on Friday, saying he gives the party its best chance of holding congressional majorities.

âWe stand on the precipice of one of the most important elections of our lifetime," the group said in a statement. "This great nation cannot endure eight more years of Democrat-control of the White House.Â It cannot afford to put Democrats in charge of Congress. It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee, Mr. Donald J. Trump, and maintain control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.â

The committee chairs backing Trump:Â Steve Chabot of Ohio (Small Business), Michael Conaway of TexasÂ (Agriculture), Jeb Hensarling of Texas (Financial Services), Candice Miller of Michigan (House Administration), Jeff Miller of FloridaÂ (Veteransâ Affairs), Tom Price of Georgia (Budget), Pete Sessions of Texas (Rules), Bill Shuster of PennsylvaniaÂ (Transportation and Infrastructure), and Lamar Smith of Texas (Science, Space and Technology).

The supportÂ came a day after Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has held off endorsing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.

Some Republicans are concerned that Trump may lose big in the fall to Democrat Hillary Clinton, costing the party control of the House and Senate.

Trump welcome the endorsement of the various chairmen, saying that "aÂ strong House Republican Majority is imperative to fixing the problems facing America and making our country better and stronger than ever before.â
