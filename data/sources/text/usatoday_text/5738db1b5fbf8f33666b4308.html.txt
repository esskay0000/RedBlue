Saturday Night Live managed to skewer Donald Trump and several of his former Republican rivals with a sketch that mocked his reputation for masquerading as his own publicist.

SNLâs opening routine shows Darrell Hammondâs Trump on the phone with a reporter, insisting that heâs actually Trumpâs publicist, Joey Pepperoni. âNo, I am not Donald Trump in disguise,â he said. âThis is just what classy people sound like, Ok?â

Pepperoniâs pitch to the reporter: âMr. Trump is the real-life inspiration for Iron Man.â

The inspiration for the sketch, of course, comes from new reports that Trump often posed as his own publicist, using the names John Barron or John Miller, to praise himself to reporters and even boast about potential sexual conquests. Donald Trump and his camp are denyingÂ he posed as his own spokesman on a 1991Â recording that emerged recentlyÂ in The Washington Post.

SNLâs sketch also features Bobby Monyihan as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, âhelpingâ Trump vet potential vice presidential choices while openly angling for the post himself.

Carly Fiorina could help Trump with his âwomen problem,â Christie suggests. âWomen look up to her.â

âFor what?â Trump retorts. âSheâs a B-cup, tops.â

What about Marco Rubio? âOh, little Marco,â Trump scoffs. âI canât ask him to be VP until his parents sign the release form.â

After running through all the politicians who would never agree serve as his No. 2Â â Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, House Speaker Paul Ryan and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley among them â Christie offers that: âMaybe, just maybe, the person you have been looking for the whole time is standing in this room right now.â

âYou are so right,â Trump says, summoning another Republican waiting just outside the door to his office. âBen Carson, you wanna be vice president?â
