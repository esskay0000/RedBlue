Lindsey Graham has had all kinds of things to say about Donald Trump, but on Thursday he had a few nice words.

The office of the South Carolina senator and well-known Trump critic said that he had spoken with the presumptive GOP nominee on Wednesday. He even â gasp! â called the conversation âpleasantâ and said Trump âasked good questions.â



âI had a cordial, pleasant phone conversation with Mr. Trump.Â  I congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination for President.Â  I know Mr. Trump is reaching out to many people, throughout the party and the country, to solicit their advice and opinions.Â  I believe this is a wise move on his part.

We had a good fifteen minute discussion centered on the national security threats facing the United States.Â  Many of these threats are the result of President Obamaâs failed policies.Â 

I gave him my assessment about where we stand in the fight against ISIL and the long-term danger posed by the Iranian nuclear deal.Â  He asked good questions.Â Â Â 

Finally, my position remains the same regarding both candidates running for President.Â  I will do what I can in the Senate to help the next president.Â  The next president will inherit a mess.â

Last week in a series of tweets he announced he wouldnât be voting for Trump or Hillary Clinton, saying that he did not believe Trump "is a reliable Republican conservative.â Later,Â in an interview with CNN, he said âI think Donald Trump is going to places where very few people have gone, and I'm not going with him."
