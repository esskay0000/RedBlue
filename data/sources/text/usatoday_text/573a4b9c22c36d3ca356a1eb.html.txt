Megyn Kelly, one day before her one-on-one interview with Donald Trump airs, said that despite some slight warming from Republican women, Donald Trump's unfavorables with women still âare unusually high.â

Megyn Kelly had been trying to get a meeting with Donald Trump for months but he just kept unleashing on her on Twitter.

Kelly was on Good Morning America Monday to talk about her much-touted interview (the first one-on-one since theirÂ nearly yearlong spat) with Donald Trump, which will appear on Fox Broadcast on Tuesday at 8 p.m.

âHow did you guys get together?â host George Stephanopoulos asked Kelly about her original meeting with TrumpÂ at Trump Tower in April.

âIn April there was a lull in the tweet storm, and I seized on the opportunityâ to reach out to him, Kelly said. âI had been looking for months for just the right window to go in there. But every time I thought I was there, heâd start up again, whether it was boycotting the second Fox News debate or,Â you know, calling me crazy and sick after the third debate.â

Kelly also touched on Trump's unfavorable ratings with women.

âRepublican women have warmed a little to Trump, although his unfavorables even with Republican women are still high, unusually high,âÂ Kelly said.Â âThe Republican candidate is going to need to do better than Mitt Romney did,â she added, pointing to the fact that Romney lost to President Obama by 11 points with women.

ABC then aired a clip from the interview where Kelly asks Trump whether he was ever bullied as child.

âNo, I wasn't. But I have seen bullying, and bullying doesn't have to just be as a child. I mean, I know people are bullied when they're 55 years old,â Trump said.

âIt can happen when you're 45,â said Kelly, who is 45 years old.

âIt happens, right? But you gotta get over it, fight back, do whatever you have to do,â Trump responded. âIâve been saying during this whole campaign that Iâm a counter-puncher, you understand that. I'm responding."

Trump has spent the better part of the year attacking the Fox News host on a variety of issues.

In pre-released interview clips from Fox,Â Trump also discussed the way he thinks journalists should act.

âFair. I donât care if they are nice. They have to be fair," he said.

Trump also said he doesn't necessarily view himself as powerful but more as a messenger.

"Well, I donât view myself as that. I mean, I view myself as a person that â like everybody else â is fighting for survival," Trump said. "And I really view myself now as somewhat of a messenger."
