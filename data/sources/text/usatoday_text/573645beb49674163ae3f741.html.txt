Harry Reid is not mincing words.

"Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs,â Reid said about his counterpart, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on the Senate floor Thursday,Â according to Roll Call.

The Senate Democratic leaderÂ was speaking ahead of a series of meetings between Trump, McConnell and other Republican leaders. McConnell has said he will support Trump.

"When they get together, they can talk about their policies about being anti-woman,â Reid said.

Reid's bashing of McConnell comes just one day after a tense exchange between Reid and Florida Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson, according toÂ Politico. After Grayson taunted Reid to âsay my name,â Reid snapped back: âI want you to lose."
