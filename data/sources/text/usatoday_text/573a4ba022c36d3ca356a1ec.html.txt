Bernie Sanders may be the least likely candidate to make it to the general election, but his approach to health care scores well in a new poll.

A Gallup poll released Monday found that a proposal to replace theÂ Affordable Care Act with federally funded health care for all is favored by 58% of U.S. adults, while 37% are opposed. Sanders, a Vermont senator, has championed a single-payer, federally run health care system.

A little more than halfÂ (51%) support repealing the law, which Donald Trump has favored. Forty-five percentÂ opposed that approach.

And 48% of those surveyed support retaining the Affordable Care Act, whichÂ 49% of Americans oppose. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has touted the Affordable Care Act and has proposed strengthening it.

None of the candidatesâ names were attached to their proposal during questioning.

The telephone poll of 1,549 U.S. adults was conducted May 6-8 with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
