HappyÂ Opposite â er, Election â Day, Kentucky and Oregon!

OregonÂ should be the more interesting raceÂ because itÂ has more delegatesÂ and Bernie Sanders is supposed to beÂ like the Messiah there. A resounding win in Oregon could inject new life intoÂ hisÂ mathematically improbable questÂ to win the Democratic nomination. (RepublicansÂ also are voting todayÂ in that state, not that it really matters. Thanks, Indiana, for ruining everyone'sÂ fun.)

But on Opposite â er, Election â Day, the focus is on Kentucky, where Hillary Clinton is now struggling, and some say itâs partiallyÂ because of three wordsÂ she uttered in March. Clinton and Sanders both want to put the coal industry âout of business,â but Clinton made the mistake of actually saying it instead of wordsmithing concern for miners.Â And that mightily offended the parts of Kentucky with big coal operations,Â bless her heart.

So, on Opposite â er, Election â Day, saying what you mean in a year where that is supposed to carry political weight may be hurting Clinton in one state. Meanwhile, sheâsÂ inched aheadÂ in Sandersâ supposed Oregon stronghold.

Huh. Opposite Day. Next time it's gonna beÂ Go Jump Off a Cliff Day. Right, Squidward?

The thought crossed our minds: What if Democrats were voting according to Republican rules and vice versa? Would we have a more competitive Opposite â er, Election â Day? No, actually. The good folks at Five Thirty Eight did the math (so we donât have to â remember the bad idea that is us and math?) and found thatÂ Clintonâs delegate lead would be tripleÂ what it is now if Dems were following GOP rules. Itâs a different story on the Republican side. If they were playing by Dem rules,Â Trumpâs delegate count would be a lot lower, a contested convention would almost be a definite, and people would actually care how Republicans in Oregon vote today.

So, before we move on to the two big Trump stories of the day, which may make you feel dumber, letâs talk about something important: the Voting Rights Act. This is the first presidential election since the Supreme CourtÂ struck part of the civil-rights lawÂ that requires certain states to get federal pre-approval before changing any of its election rules. States have since passed new voting requirements that some worryÂ will suppress turnout among minorities and young people. So, there areÂ lawsuits galore, and if any of themÂ make it to the Supreme Court by November,Â the justices whoÂ canât agree whether the sky is blue could very well decide the election. Yay, Democracy!

    The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told viewers of 'Good Morning Britian' that he is neither divisive nor stupid in response to David Cameron's assertion that Trump is 'divisive, stupid and wrong.' (May 16)

Donald TrumpÂ challenged newly elected London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ testÂ on âGood Morning Britain.â Insert your own intelligence joke here. Meanwhile, we at Team FTR decided to Google the smartest presidents of all time. And in less than a second, we hadÂ U.S. News and World Reportâs rankingÂ at our fingertips, which told us John Quincy Adams was some sort of colonial Einstein. In other words: He was far too smart to run for office today.

(Oh, and before we go, here are two unrelated observations about this story: 1) who makes Piers Morgan the host of a morning show? And 2) only Trump could say the following after basically telling other world leaders theyâre dumb: "I don't think I'm a divisive person. I'm a unifier.")
