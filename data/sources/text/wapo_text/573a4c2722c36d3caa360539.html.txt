 PHILADELPHIA â Federal prosecutors on Monday began laying out a complicated criminal corruption case against Rep. Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania, telling jurors the longtime Democratic legislator abused his office âover and over againâ for personal gain and enlisted those who worked for him to cover his tracks.

Defense attorneys fired back that the only corrupt people in the case were those who had cut plea deals to serve as government witnesses and that Fattah had ânothing to do with any of it.â

 Fattah, 59, and four allies were charged in a 29-count indictment in July with a medley of corrupt dealings that federal authorities said were meant to boost the veteran congressmanâs political career and benefit him and his family financially. The racketeering and other allegations probably cost Fattah his legislative seat â he was bested in the Democratic primary last month by state Rep. Dwight Evans â and now he and his associates are fighting for exoneration from criminal charges.

Their trial began in earnest with Mondayâs opening statements.

 Those charged, flanked by their lawyers, sat side by side against one wall of the courtroom, their chairs arranged in an L-shape so all could fit. Dozens of spectators filled four rows of seats behind them. Fattah smiled and mingled casually with supporters before the proceedings began, then watched the prosecutor and jurors during opening statements. His office seemed to function as normal Monday, even  issuing a statement on a slain Philadelphia police officer  who was awarded a Medal of Valor.  

The trial marks a remarkable downfall for Fattah, who â despite his loss in the 2007 mayoral election â seemed to be a staple of Philadelphia politics, having held his congressional seat for more than two decades. Allegations had long swirled around him, but as recently as two years ago he had no primary challenger and easily defeated a Republican opponent.

Many of the corrupt dealings alleged by prosecutors stemmed from Fattahâs unsuccessful bid to become Philadelphiaâs mayor. Prosecutors said Fattah and his associates arranged an illegal $1Â million loan to support Fattahâs mayoral campaign and stole charitable and federal grant funds to repay a portion of it. Fattah promised to get federal funds earmarked to a nonexistent nonprofit organization to pay off another mayoral campaign debt, prosecutors also charged.

They also alleged that Fattah used campaign funds to pay personal expenses, including his sonâs college tuition, and that he helped a lobbyist try to win a job as an ambassador or trade representative in exchange for cash and other gratuities. Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Gray said Fattah used the lobbyist as a âhuman ATM machine.â

âThe congressman abused his office and his authority over and over again by taking bribes and committing fraud to serve his own interests and not the interests of the people he was elected to serve,â Gray told jurors.

Fattah denied the charges when he was indicted. Defense attorney Mark Lee told jurors that while they may be presented with evidence they would find âdistasteful,â none of it indicated Fattah was guilty of criminal corruption.

âItâs important to understand that unless those things cross a certain line â and the government has a burden of proof to show they do â theyâre not crimes,â Lee said.

On Monday, FBI Special Agent Eric Ruona began describing for jurors the financial deals that form the base of the governmentâs case. Gray told jurors that prosecutors would present them with bank records, emails and other documents to help prove the allegations and that âinsidersâ who had already pleaded guilty would help them understand the sometimes complicated schemes. One of those insiders is Tom Lindenfeld, a former close adviser to D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). Lindenfeld admitted to a political corruption charge in the Fattah case in 2014.

Lee pointed the finger squarely at Lindenfeld and another cooperator, Gregory Naylor, saying their corrupt actions âhad nothing whatsoever to do with Congressman Fattah.â

The others charged in the case and facing trial are Herbert Vederman, a lobbyist and former deputy mayor of Philadelphia; Robert Brand, a businessman and the spouse of a former Fattah congressional staffer; Karen Nicholas, the chief executive of a Fattah-founded nonprofit that is deeply enmeshed in the criminal allegations; and Bonnie Bowser, Fattahâs district chief of staff in Philadelphia, who served as treasurer for his congressional and mayoral campaigns. Each has pleaded not guilty.
