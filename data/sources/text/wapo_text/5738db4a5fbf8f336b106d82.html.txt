 The inside track on Washington politics.

When Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced his candidacy last spring, he trailed Hillary Clinton by 56 points in national polling. He had the support of less thanÂ 6 percent of Democrats. How many of those Democrats were residents of Vermont is hard to say, but it's pretty safe to assume that part of Sanders's low poll numbers were the fact that, to most Americans, he was one of the vast majority of the United States of whom they'd never heard.

That changed. Quickly.

Gallup conducts regular polling on how Americans view presidential candidates, asking respondents whether they view politicians favorably or unfavorably. There's a third option, too; people can tell Gallup whether they've never heard of the candidate. And using that metric, we can get a good sense for how quickly (or slowly) awareness of presidential candidates spread across the country.

There are three types of candidates. There are candidates of whom no one has ever heard, such asÂ Sanders. There are candidates that are somewhat well-known, as was John McCain in 2008. And there are candidates who everyone knows, such asÂ Hillary Clinton this year.

We took Gallup's data and plotted awareness for each candidate from the first poll before a presidential election to the point at which they were so well known that Gallup couldn't even register anyone who'd never heard of them. By doing so, we can categorize each nomineeÂ since 1992 and three remaining 2016 candidates.



The three candidates that saw the sharpest, longest drops in the number of people who had never heard of them were Sanders, John Kerry in 2004 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton was unknown by half of the country in January of that year, but thanks in part to alleged sexual dalliances becoming part of the nomination process, America got to know him quickly.

Sanders actually trails Kerry and Clinton in awareness at this point in the year, probably a function of his opponent having largely sewn up the nomination.



To show how quickly Americans got to know Sanders this year, though, let's contrast it with 2008. In 2008, both Barack Obama and McCain were known by most Americans the year before the primary. When the ball dropped on New Year's Eve 2008, nearly everyone in the country had heard of them.



This year, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were on a whole different level of familiarity than Sanders. He didn't close the gap entirely -- but he closed it quickly.



Part of the reason that Sanders's decline was so prolonged is that we have Gallup data from earlier in the campaign that we do in other contests. But that shouldn't detract from the remarkable change in awareness that he enjoyed.

On March 4, 2015, 6 in 10 Americans had never heard of him. A year later, he'd beaten Hillary Clinton in five states, on his way to dragging the once-invincible contender into a 50-state fight.
