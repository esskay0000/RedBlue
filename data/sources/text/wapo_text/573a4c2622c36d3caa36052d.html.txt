After months of griping about Megyn Kelly's "unfair" coverage of his presidential candidacy, human mood ring Donald Trump now says the Fox News Channel host did him a favor by asking the tough debate question about his treatment of women that ignited their feud last summer.

This turnaround comment is part of the latest tease distributed by Fox to hype Tuesday's Trump-Kelly interview, which airs during the "Megyn Kelly Presents" broadcast special at 8 p.m.

  [The big Donald Trump-Megyn Kelly interview: What we know so far]  

"I'll tell you what: In a certain way, what you did might have been a favor, because I felt so good about having gotten through" it, Trump tells Kelly in the taped interview, according to a new excerpt. "I said, 'If I could get through this debate, with those questions, you can get through anything.'"

Yes, it's a truly inspiring story of perseverance and self-discoveryÂ â how Trump found the inner strength to survive Mean Megyn and conquer the GOP.

It's becoming clear, as we piece together the clips and quotes put out ahead of this interview, that Trump does his best to cast himself as the victim and Kelly as the aggressor. He wants to portray herÂ as the instigator, by virtue of that inquiry onÂ Aug. 6 about his habit of insulting women and whether he possesses a presidential "temperament."

  [Here are the Megyn Kelly questions that Donald Trump is still sore about]  

"I've been saying during this whole campaign that I'm a counter-puncher," Trump says at another point in the interview. "You understand that; I'm responding."

In the general election, Trump will surely face criticism for the nasty rhetoric he aimed at Kelly, his primary opponents and others. This seems likely to be his defenseÂ â that he was merely returning fire, albeit with much greater intensity.

It's all part of the leadership persona Trump is crafting for himself. He wants to be seen as a strong potential president who doesn't pick fights but knows how to finish them. Tuesday's interview with Kelly appears to be one step in his plan to project this image.
