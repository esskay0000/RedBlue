Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump hit back against criticism from British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan in a British TVÂ interview broadcast Monday, issuing sharp broadsides against leading political figures inÂ one of the United States' closest foreign allies.

Speaking to Piers Morgan on ITV's "Good Morning Britain," the mogul predicted that his relationship with Cameron could be rocky if he is elected president. He also brushed off criticism from Khan, the first Muslim mayor of London.

"Looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship," Trump said of Cameron. He quickly added: "Who knows, I hope to have a good relationship with him."

Cameron has voiced strong criticism of Trump's proposed ban on Muslims' entering the United States over concerns about terrorist attacks,Â calling itÂ âdivisive, stupid and wrong."

Khan recently took sharp aim at Trump's plan.Â âDonald Trumpâs ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe â it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists," Khan said in a recent statement, the Associated Press reported.

"When he won, I wished him well. Now I don't care about him," Trump said of Khan.

Trump also said that he didn't think Great Britain would be "hurt at all" on trade deals with the United States if it left the European Union.
