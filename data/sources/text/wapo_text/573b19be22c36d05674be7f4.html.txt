Hillary Clinton has been honing her Donald Trump impression for months now.

She debuted it at campaign stops last fall, while calling Trump "entertaining" (language she surely wouldn't use now, given the attacks that Trump has thrown her way in the months since).

Then, the impression graduated from the stump to the late-night television circuit. She brought it out on "The Tonight Show" when Jimmy Fallon asked about her use of a TelePrompTer in September. And it made another appearance â perhaps its most committed and fully acted showing â on an October episode of "Saturday Night Live," when Clinton portrayed a bartender speaking to "Hillary Clinton" (played by Kate McKinnon).

And now that Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, her impression is back on the campaign trail. She briefly impersonated Trump at a rally in Bowling Green, Ky., on Monday, putting herself opposite The Donald onstage in a hypothetical presidential debate.

"Now personally, I am really looking forward to [debating Trump]," she said. "What is your plan to create jobs?" she asked. Then it was time for a bit of Queens-accent-infused acting.

"His answer is, 'I'm gonna create 'em. They're gonna be great! I know how to do it, but I'm not telling you what it is I'm going to do,'" she intoned as the crowd chuckled along.

Of course, Trump has his own Clinton impression, too. Specifically, the impression he calls "Crooked Hillary," which usually involves doing robotic motions onstage, and speaking in the halting, bizarrely monosyllabic tone of a text-to-speech computer program.

Candidates doing (bad) impressions of each other onstage isn't the most policy-oriented facet of campaigning. But the other side of the battle for the White House is the battle over character, and as the two campaigns begin to circle each other, each sizing up the other as the general election draws nearer, those impressions give us a window into the way each candidate sees the other -- or, at least, wants us to see the other.

Clinton's impression of Trump makes it clear that wants us toÂ see him as a guy who talks big without having any real plans, and with an ego to match. Trump's impression of Clinton casts her as robotic and out of touch with voters.

There's no telling how many times we'll be treated to more candidate impressions. But you can bet the underlying messages they portrayÂ won't go away any time soon.
