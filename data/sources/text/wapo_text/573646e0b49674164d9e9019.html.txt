The Obama administration finalized a new rule Friday mandating that health insurers provide transgender patients with coverage for services and access to facilities even if those services were not traditionally covered or required by their expressed gender, as well as separate guidance calling on public schools to let transgender students access the bathrooms and facilities of their choice.

The two moves, both of which have been in the works for more than a year, reflect the Obama administration’s push to affirm transgender rights as a central civil-rights question for the current era. And they sparked an immediate backlash from conservatives on the state and federal level, who described the new measures as government overreach.

While the new Department of Health and Human Services rule does not require insurers to automatically approve all gender transitioning services, it means that they cannot categorically deny coverage as they have in the past. These services can range from vaginal reconstruction to treatment for ovarian cancer when an individual identifies as a man.

Winnie Stachelberg, executive vice president for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said the two policies show “the administration has spoken quite clearly” on what protections transgender Americans deserve in schools and in the medical arena.

“Every time we have a debate about the issue, whichever side you’re on, raising the issue make people stop and have to confront the way they think,” she said. “It is in that moment, it is in that fight, as we’ve seen on LGBT issues, that we make progress.”

That fight intensified Friday, especially in wake of the Education and Justice Department’s instruction to schools across the country that they must accommodate transgender students by allowing them to use facilities and participate in single-sex activities that match their chosen gender identity, rather than the one listed on their birth certificate.

The Justice Department is already embroiled in a legal battle with the state of North Carolina over that state’s law mandating that individuals can only access a bathroom that matches their gender at birth; on Friday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the administration “must be challenged” over its nationwide guidance on the issue, adding, “If President Obama thinks he can bully Texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight.”

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) described the proposal in dire terms Friday, saying, “This will be the end of public education, if this prevails.”

But White House officials were unapologetic in the face of such criticism.

“I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to a statewide office,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, referring to Patrick.

The health-care rule, which applies to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and was first proposed in September, mandates that any health insurance company that participates in the federal health-care exchange cannot deny individuals health care or coverage based on their gender identity, and “must be treated consistent with their gender identity, including in access to facilities.”

Friday’s ruling is significant because insurers must apply this same approach to every plan they administer, including those in the private sector or elsewhere in the federal government. 

“A central goal of the Affordable Care Act is to help all Americans access quality, affordable health care. Today’s announcement is a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system and reaffirms this Administration’s commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, in a statement.

Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, called the move “tremendously significant.” She added that while her group and others believe the health-care law already includes this requirement because it bars sex discrimination, “not all the insurance companies and everybody agrees with that.”

“It’s very important to clarify and specify that trans discrimination is illegal in the provision of health-care services and health insurance,” Keisling said.
