The New Yorker magazine's latest cover shot at Donald Trump has the Republican candidate performing the old "saw-the-person-in-half" magic trick.

In this case, the person is the Republican Party.

Artist Barry Blitt, who titled his latest work "Grand Illusion," notes that "this is the fourth time in less than a year that I’ve drawn Trump (or his hands) ... It seems like a lot, but the Trump-induced rift in the G.O.P. is the least depressing of the items on the current news cycle.”

Of course, with more and more Republicans getting on board with Trump, it may be worth remembering: This is just a trick; the person is never really sawed in half.
