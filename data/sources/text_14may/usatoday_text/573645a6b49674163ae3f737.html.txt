    Video: Bernie Sanders confuses Sioux Falls and Sioux City
    

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. â€” Bernie Sanders began his Sioux Falls rally with a geography gaffe.

Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president, called Sioux Falls "Sioux City" at the beginning of his speech Thursday night at the Convention Center.

"Your presence here tonight tells me that Sioux City is ready for a political revolution," he said.

The crowd in attendance let out an audible groan, and Sanders caught his mistake a few seconds later.

"I got half of it it right," he said after putting his hand on his head. "Alright, Sioux Falls, thank you."

Barack Obama also said "Sioux City" when he campaigned in Sioux Falls in 2008.
