John Weaver, chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign, taunted Sen. Marco Rubio for failing to win any states on Super Tuesday. 

In a memo sent out Tuesday night, Weaver argued that after a month in which Kasich had played "an away game," the GOP race is moving onto his home turf after Tuesday "and the race will fully reset when it gets to Ohio on March 15."

Weaver taunted Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz in separate sections of the memo. He didn't devote a section to Donald Trump, who won most of the states on Tuesday. 

"Sen. Rubio has been more hyped than Crystal Pepsi, but he has flopped even worse," Weaver wrote. "Even a well-conceived, high-financed marketing campaign won’t work if people don’t want to buy the product. That’s the Rubio campaign’s problem. ... Behind the nice packaging, voters are discovering there is little substance."

Then Weaver went on to criticize Cruz. 

"Ted Cruz bet it all on today, spending more than any other candidate," Weaver continued. "He needed an overwhelming delegate lead to have a shot at winning the nomination, and he fell short. The end of the road is nearing for him. With the race beginning to move north, he has no ability to grow beyond his current level of support." 

Weaver concluded that Kasich remains the candidate best-positioned to stop Trump. 

"We are executing our campaign plan and John Kasich is the best choice moving forward for Republicans who want to stop Donald Trump and win the White House," Weaver wrote.
