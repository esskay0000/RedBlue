College students aren’t generally known for their reticence, but some schools have found an efficient way to hush them up, by forcing them to sign along a dotted line.

New research by The Century Foundation (TCF) and Public Citizen reveals that for-profit schools have used deceptive enrollment contracts to erect a legal firewall, perhaps completely unbeknownst to the student, to preempt access to justice. According to TCF’s research, among higher-education institutions, these clauses are almost exclusively used by for-profit educational institutions.		
College-enrollment contracts should, in theory, outline students’ rights and responsibilities, but the main purpose behind the restrictive clauses has nothing to do with education, it’s simply “protecting the financial interests of the school by limiting a student’s legal rights, should something go wrong.” And it has often gone awfully wrong. Massive private college chains like the now-bankrupt Corinthian have become notorious nationwide for operating as fly-by-night scams, delivering subpar courses or incompetent programming.		
In one instance reported in The New York Times, a group of former students of Lamson College in Illinois went through the painstaking process of preparing a legal case against their institution for cheating them and failing to fulfill its academic obligations, only to realize too late that an obscure restrictive clause that prevented class-action lawsuits meant their case would never make it into court. Many contracts impose such “go it alone” clauses, TCF says, to preempt individuals who share grievances from banding together to sue on behalf of a larger group of victims. Preventing collective legal action presents a potentially devastating barrier for former students of the large for-profit school groups with many campuses nationwide, all with similarly shady financial schemes. (Federal rule changes recently proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau might amend arbitration procedures to allow financial consumers to file lawsuits in some cases, but would specifically exclude for-profit colleges.)		
On top of blockading full-fledged lawsuits, contracts often impose a binding arbitration process through so-called “internal process requirements.” These quasi-legal proceedings are often heavily skewed in favor of the corporation, yet corporations often bill arbitration as a supposedly efficient way to resolve a dispute. In reality, argues TCF researcher Tariq Habash, although “these schools are forcing students into this ‘faster, cheaper process,’ they are requiring them to go through mandatory internal processes that can take months to complete, making it anything but expedited.”

The Lamson students entered a private arbitration, facing a corporate lawyer and hostile arbitrator who “ruled against the former students and, to top it off, socked them with a legal bill of more than $350,000 because of the ‘hardship’ the students had supposedly inflicted on the company that owned the school.”		
Contracts could also restrain students’ legal rights through a “gag clause,” which curtails disclosure of any future out-of-court settlements with the institution. (Such preemptive rules almost seem to anticipate predatory activities as an integral part of the for-profit business model).

Habash noted the various contractual restrictions can compound each other in a way that could deter any form of legal or regulatory action. In more than a dozen schools TCF investigated, Habash says, the administrations “first require students to go through an internal grievance process” prior to arbitration, which the school could use to deter or intimidate them from seeking further recourse through the government.		
“While these processes cannot actually restrict students from complaining to a government agency or an accrediting body,” Habash says, “by presenting students with information that they must complain [to the institution first], it sends a very misleading message.” In one example presented in the study, veteran students tried to complain to the Veterans Administration about the the quality of their ITT Tech programs, and the school then “scolded former students for taking their complaints to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs rather than using the agreed-to grievance procedures,” thereby “implying that the student had violated a contractual obligation” when in fact it was within their right to complain to the official veterans’ advocate.		
The massive wall of silence surrounding these former students could limit regulators’ ability to investigate college scams.		
According to Habash:		
Because of the [restrictive clauses’] confidential nature, law enforcement authorities at state and federal levels have much more difficulty learning about complaints because institutions using these clauses are trying to stop any negative complaints from going public.		
The stakes are high. The largest institutions that deploy sneak contract clauses include big for-profit college brands that rake in millions in federal largess. The University of Phoenix, for example, a nationwide program with more than 254,000 students, reportedly received over $2.75 billion in federal financial aid. Students’ financial victimization is exacerbated by the general public backlash against the for-profit institutions, which has rendered their diplomas virtually worthless on the job market. (The schools, however, can readily seek federal bankruptcy relief, unlike their ruined former students.)		
Public Citizen has petitioned the Department of Education urging it to revise its Title IV funding regulations to prevent federal Title IV higher-education funds from supporting schools that impose arbitration clauses: “these arbitration clauses are detrimental to students, hamper efforts to uncover wrongdoing by institutions” that receive federal aid, and thus “place the federal investment…at risk,” the group argued, with the worst effects suffered by low-income students, people of color, and veterans. Going forward, the organization urged education authorities curb legal preemption tactics by essentially banning any institution seeking federal support from imposing any “agreement that requires a student, in advance of a dispute…to agree to arbitrate such a dispute.”		
Moreover, since the language of restrictive contract clauses is so sweeping, Habash notes, it’s even possible for the legal barriers to extend to non-financial grievances, such as a civil-rights complaint alleging racial or gender discrimination. Ultimately, it’s not just an assault on students’ financial security, but a stealth war on civil justice and educational democracy.		
Although the truth about for-profit higher education is finally bubbling to the surface, the most damning evidence of corruption may never see the light of day, because the victims didn’t understand that signing up for college meant signing away their voice.

The stakes are high. The largest institutions that deploy sneak contract clauses include big for-profit college brands that rake in millions in federal largess. The University of Phoenix, for example, a nationwide program with more than 254,000 students, reportedly received over $2.75 billion in federal financial aid. Students’ financial victimization is exacerbated by the general public backlash against the for-profit institutions, which has rendered their diplomas virtually worthless on the job market. (The schools, however, can readily seek federal bankruptcy relief, unlike their ruined former students.)		
Public Citizen has petitioned the Department of Education urging it to revise its Title IV funding regulations to prevent federal Title IV higher-education funds from supporting schools that impose arbitration clauses: “these arbitration clauses are detrimental to students, hamper efforts to uncover wrongdoing by institutions” that receive federal aid, and thus “place the federal investment…at risk,” the group argued, with the worst effects suffered by low-income students, people of color, and veterans. Going forward, the organization urged education authorities curb legal preemption tactics by essentially banning any institution seeking federal support from imposing any “agreement that requires a student, in advance of a dispute…to agree to arbitrate such a dispute.”		
Moreover, since the language of restrictive contract clauses is so sweeping, Habash notes, it’s even possible for the legal barriers to extend to non-financial grievances, such as a civil-rights complaint alleging racial or gender discrimination. Ultimately, it’s not just an assault on students’ financial security, but a stealth war on civil justice and educational democracy.		
Although the truth about for-profit higher education is finally bubbling to the surface, the most damning evidence of corruption may never see the light of day, because the victims didn’t understand that signing up for college meant signing away their voice.

Habash noted the various contractual restrictions can compound each other in a way that could deter any form of legal or regulatory action. In more than a dozen schools TCF investigated, Habash says, the administrations “first require students to go through an internal grievance process” prior to arbitration, which the school could use to deter or intimidate them from seeking further recourse through the government.		
“While these processes cannot actually restrict students from complaining to a government agency or an accrediting body,” Habash says, “by presenting students with information that they must complain [to the institution first], it sends a very misleading message.” In one example presented in the study, veteran students tried to complain to the Veterans Administration about the the quality of their ITT Tech programs, and the school then “scolded former students for taking their complaints to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs rather than using the agreed-to grievance procedures,” thereby “implying that the student had violated a contractual obligation” when in fact it was within their right to complain to the official veterans’ advocate.		
The massive wall of silence surrounding these former students could limit regulators’ ability to investigate college scams.

The Supreme Court has abused the Federal Arbitration act, which originated between business entities that had ongoing relations with each other, into contractual waivers of public justice, and often any justice, which are either imposed on or slipped by, or both, consumers who aren&apos;t thinking about getting ripped off and have no idea it is there until it is too late. The CFPB is proposing a limitation for financial transactions it has jurisdiction over, but this oppressive tactic is found in school, employment, nursing home and other consumer contracts as well. The public needs to demand restrictions on arbitration clauses in all consumer transactions.

Arbitration agreements are buried in the fine print of enrollment agreements. Most students selecting and aspiring to to a degree are in the throes of the exciting future and careers that their degrees will mean. Suing a school over failure to provide a degree and quality of education they hope for is far from where their minds are at that time.

The arbitration agreement insures they will never engage in a civil suit under a real court of law. That the federal government and student loan system allowed these agreements to take place is part of this crime.

Aspiring students, go to a state public school, save lots of money and get a decent education. Most of the state schools offer lots of online course work if not entire degree programs.

I think it&apos;s important to address these "forced arbitration/no class action suits/no transparency" clauses in all contracts, not just in for-profit schools.

BUT, I also see a problem with class action suits as currently structured.  Imagine a typical settlement of $15 million.  Of that, a third may go to the successful law firm.  Another $2 million goes to the firm (often a subsidiary of the law firm) that handles notification & disbursement and a couple hundred thou total goes to the "principal plaintiffs," the people actually named in the suit.  Of the original $15 million, that leaves $6.8 million for the individual class members.  Each individual claim is typically worth $8.95, not enough to make it worth your while to fill out the forms, so it will be unusual if a million is distributed that way.

So, what&apos;s the net result for We The People?  The lawyers are $7 million richer, the losing company is $8 million plus legal fees poorer and WTP are a million richer.  But where does that $8+ million come from?  Why, We The People, of course.  The losing company doesn&apos;t have any money that didn&apos;t come from their customers (WTP) and the class action lawyers certainly didn&apos;t create any money- they just transferrred it from customer&apos;s pockets to theirs, via the bank account of the losing company.
Not really what I call financial justice.

I WOULD GO FURTHER AND OUTLAW PROFIT-MAKING INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION.  IT IS THE COMMON CONCEIT OF OUR AGE THAT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NON-PROFIT INSTITUTIONS, OUR TRADITIONAL MEANS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, CANNOT.  IF TRUE, THEN WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH, RATHER THAN THE SEARCH FOR WEALTH, AS THEIR DISTINGUISHING FEATURES.  DIPLOMA MILLS SHOULD BE OUTLAWED.

I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything wrong with for-profit educational institutions per se.  We tell everyone education is valuable and money certainly changes hands in non-profit institutions- grade school, high school, college; money from city, county, state and federal sources, as well as private money.  There are home-schoolers, private schools, religious schools.  There are private and public non-profit universities and private for-profit schools.  There are MANY models, and money changes hands in almost everyone of them.


So money and profits per se aren&apos;t the issue.  The question is whether contracts are fair and open, with measurable results that provide an appropriate return on investment.  And therein lies the rub.  Do public non-profits really give us a good return?  Is it better than private non-profits?  How would we know?


How about this for a contract?  Per semester attended the school gets 0.02% of your income over $20,000 for the next 10 years.  Or maybe 0.01% for 20 years.  If education really does pay off, the school will benefit in higher payments from ex-students.  If not, 0.05% of your income is pretty minuscule and you&apos;re not going to turn down a promotion just to get out of paying the school- they only get a very small percentage.  Or maybe they get a payment based on how much your salary increases beat inflation.

This is penny-wise and pound foolish.  We have state colleges with administrators getting as much as $600,000.  They don&apos;t make a "profit" but rip us off just as badly, sucking money out of educational needs and giving many adjuncts and even tenured professors living on a very tight budget.  If Sanders is elected, this should end.

Don&apos;t the private colleges charge enough as it is?  I say go to public schooling to avoid these grasping entities.
