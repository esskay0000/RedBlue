U.S. BEEFING UP IN LIBYA: It’s still a very small contingent of troops — fewer than 25, divided in two teams — but the new installations at outposts in Libya reflect that the Obama administration is growing more concerned about terrorist threats there, particularly from the Islamic State. The Pentagon has been drafting plans for engagement for months, and the new Special Operations troops on the ground are responsible for finding local partners that could serve as allies in the case of a charge against the Islamic State. Together, they shape up as signs of a new military engagement in Libya.

U.S. officials had been trying to wait on stating a policy until after a unity government was established in Libya, which has been split by two rival governments operating in the east and west. But a unity government has been difficult to achieve through U.N.-sponsored peace talks, making it more difficult for the international community to agree and act on plans.Though it is smaller than the organization based in Iraq and Syria, ISIS in Libya employs the same tactics. The United States has more than 5,000 troops on the ground in Iraq, and a few hundred in Syria.

HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER KILLED IN SYRIA: The leader of Hezbollah’s militia forces in Syria appears to have been killed during a blast in Damascus, the group announced on Friday — a development that would be a significant blow to the Iranian-backed forces that have played a key role in supporting the government of Syrian government Bashar al-Assad.

It isn’t clear who caused the explosion that killed Mustafa Badreddine, the most senior Hezbollah official to be killed since Imad Mughniyah — who just happened to be Badreddine’s mentor — was killed in 2008. Badreddine wasn’t just known from his role in Syria — over the years he had been accused of participation in many high-profile Hezbollah operations, including the 1983 attack on military barracks in Beirut that killed U.S. and French soldiers, as well as the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.

IS ARMY PLAYING RUSSIA FOR CASH?: Politico has a story that takes a different look at the defense budget and how officials think the Army may be drumming up the specter of the threat from Russia as a way of getting more money at a time when budgets are being constrained. Officials in the story point to a pattern of painting an outsize picture of the threat Russia poses that just isn’t supported by the numbers. Nonetheless, it appears to have captured the attention of the public and politicians — particularly during an election year.
