 The inside track on Washington politics.

There has been confusion this week over just how committed Donald Trump is to implementing his policy proposals if he becomes president, especially when it comes to calling for tax cuts for the wealthy and a temporary ban on allowing most foreign Muslims into the country.

During an interview on "Fox and Friends" on Friday morning, Trump clarified: "Look, anything I say right now — I'm not the president. Everything is a suggestion. No matter what you say, it is a suggestion."

It was a sentiment that Trump reiterated during an interview with the "Today" show, also on Friday, adding that as president he would be "totally flexible on very, very many issues."

When it comes to the proposed ban on Muslims, Trump said on Fox News that he feels "very strongly that we have to find out what the problem is" and has tasked former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani with heading a small committee of "really stellar people" to study immigration issues and the proposed ban.

  [No, Donald Trump has not softened his stance on banning Muslims]  

"No, I am not softening my stance at all, but I am always flexible on issues," Trump said in the interview with "Today." "I am totally flexible on very, very many issues, and I think you have to be that way. But I'm not softening my stance."

Earlier this month, Trump said that he was not willing to change his positions to win over Republican lawmakers who are concerned by his controversial rhetoric. But during an interview with "Good Morning America" on Friday, Trump seemed to soften on his hardline my-way-or-the-highway approach.

"I think there are certain things that we could talk about," Trump said. "I'm not totally inflexible on anything, but I feel when it comes to the borders, we have to have strong borders."
