They have launched an online minigame which challenges all comers to balance the budget (or at least, keep the debt-to-GDP ratio from rising) over 25 years, without throwing their favourite policies overboard. Choose imprudently and the “<a href="http://fiscalship.org/">fiscal ship</a>”—also the title of the game—will sink. The wonks hope to reach perhaps half a million voters and schoolchildren who might otherwise never realise that tweaking the corporate tax code can be fun. The Wilson’s Centre’s previous effort, “<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/budget-hero">Budget Hero</a>”, was played over 2m times. Hopefully, players will find it easier to control spending than the think-tanks did: the new game set them back about $1m.</p><p></p>
