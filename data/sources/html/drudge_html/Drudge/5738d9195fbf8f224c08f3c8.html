Trump." class="meta-per">Donald J. Trump</a> had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes.</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="513" data-total-count="611"><p>Donald was having a pool party at Mar-a-Lago. There were about 50 models and 30 men. There were girls in the pools, splashing around. For some reason Donald seemed a little smitten with me. He just started talking to me and nobody else.</p>
<p>He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansion. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn’t intended to swim. <strong>He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit.</strong></p>
<p><em>–Rowanne Brewer Lane, former companion</em></p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="807">Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a 26-year-old model, did as Mr. Trump asked. “I went into the bathroom and tried one on,” she recalled. It was a bikini. “I came out, and he said, ‘Wow.’ ”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="947">Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to show her off to the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="117" data-total-count="1064">“He brought me out to the pool and said, ‘That is a stunning Trump girl, isn’t it?’ ” Ms. Brewer Lane said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="564" data-total-count="1628">Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insults, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a campaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president: degrading, impersonal, performed. “That must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,” he told a female contestant on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Rosie O’Donnell, he said, had a “fat, ugly face.” A lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newborn? “Disgusting,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="1895">But the 1990 episode at Mar-a-Lago that Ms. Brewer Lane described was different: a debasing face-to-face encounter between Mr. Trump and a young woman he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the up-close and more intimate encounters.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-1">Continue reading the main story</a>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="2271" id="story-continues-2">The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="542" data-total-count="2813">Their accounts — many relayed here in their own words — reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interactions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who experienced them.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="3169" id="story-continues-3">What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around him, one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and encouraging. He promoted several to the loftiest heights of his company, a daring move for a major real estate developer at the time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="3442">He simultaneously nurtured women’s careers and mocked their physical appearance. “You like your candy,” he told an overweight female executive who oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He could be lewd one moment and gentlemanly the next.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="3682">In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, someone who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. “It would just seem,” he said, “that there was something that they want to really prove.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="3950">Pressed on the women’s claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details, such as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a swimsuit. “A lot of things get made up over the years,” he said. “I have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that.”</p><figure id="media-100000004405090" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004405090 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/14/us/15trumpwomen-rowanneold/15trumpwomen-rowanneold-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="4242">But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump had the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He had connections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the women sought his assistance with their careers or remained by his side.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="4427">For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was the start of a whirlwind romance — a heady blur of helicopter rides and high-end hotel rooms and flashing cameras.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="4501">“It was intimidating,” she said. “He was Donald Trump, obviously.”</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="35" data-total-count="4536">Boarding School ‘Ladies’ Man’</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="4941">It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding school 90 minutes’ drive north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited girls from setting foot on the all-boys campus unless it was a special occasion. And on those special occasions, young Donald Trump paid careful mind to the kind of girls he brought to school. They had to be gorgeous — 10s, in his future parlance.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="160" data-total-count="5101">“Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to campus were pretty,” recalled George White, a fellow student in the class of 1964.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Her boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parents at Tavern on the Green, the ornate restaurant in Central Park.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="6603">When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking for what she wanted.

Then Donald would order steak. … Everybody order steak. I told the waiter, “I would like to have fish.” O.K., so I could have the fish. <strong>And Fred would say to the waiter:</strong><strong> “No, Ivana is not going to have a fish. She is going to have a steak.”</strong> I said, “No, I’m going to have my fish.” And Donald would come home and say, “Ivana, why would you have a fish instead of a steak?” I say, “Because I’m not going to be told by somebody to have something which I don’t want.”</p>
<p><em>–Ivana Trump, ex-wife</em></p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="7399">Mr. Trump defended his father’s conduct. “He would’ve said that out of love,” he said.

When his son hired a woman, <a href="https://www.createspace.com/6026691">Barbara A. Res</a>, as his head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and annoyed.</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="448" data-total-count="8041"><p>Fred did not like the idea that Donald had hired me. “A woman?” Donald told me that.

Soon enough, she said, he delivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. After boasting of his connections to elite modeling agencies, he advised her to lie about her age to get ahead in the industry, she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="10107">“ ‘We’re going to have to tell them you’re 17,’ ” Ms. Taggart recalled him telling her, “because in his mind, 21 is too old.

Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when she participated in the Miss USA contest in 2009 as Miss California, was surprised to find Mr. Trump personally evaluating the women at rehearsal. “We were told to put on our opening number outfits — they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits — and line up for him onstage,” she wrote in her memoir, “Still Standing.”</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1101" data-total-count="11687"><p>Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than any general ever inspected a platoon. He would stop in front of a girl, look her up and down, and say, “Hmmm.” Then he would go on and do the same thing to the next girl. He took notes on a little pad as he went along. After he did this, Trump said: “O.K. I want all the girls to come forward.” …</p>
<p>Donald Trump looked at Miss Alabama.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he said.</p>
<p>She took one more step forward.</p>
<p>“Tell me, who’s the most beautiful woman here?”</p>
<p>Miss Alabama’s eyes swam around.</p>
<p>“Besides me?” she said. “Uh, I like Arkansas. She’s sweet.”</p>
<p><strong>“I don’t care if she’s sweet,” Donald Trump said. “Is she hot?” …</strong></p>
<p>It became clear that the point of the whole exercise was for him to divide the room between girls he personally found attractive and those he did not. Many of the girls found the exercise humiliating. Some of the girls were sobbing backstage after he left, devastated to have failed even before the competition really began to impress “The Donald.”</p>

In the statement, she described an occasion of “marital relations” during which “I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="21760">“During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” the statement said. “I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="210" data-total-count="21970">Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for comment. After the allegation re-emerged in the news media last year, Ivana <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/28/donald-trump-aide-apologizes-for-saying-you-cant-rape-your-spouse/">said in a statement</a>, “The story is totally without merit.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="22306">In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Houraney, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and later accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their business dealings. In a 1996 deposition, Ms. Harth described their initial meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower.</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="22662"><p>Donald Trump stared at me throughout that meeting. He stared at me even while George was giving his presentation. … In the middle of it he says to George, <strong>“Are you sleeping with her?”</strong> Meaning me. And George looked a little shocked and he said, “Well, yeah.” And he goes, “Well, for the weekend or what?”</p>

Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. Ms. Harth withdrew her own lawsuit against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances, but she has stood by her original claims.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="23948">Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shared email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump for helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for his presidential candidacy.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="23968">Defending His Record</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="68" data-total-count="24036">Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="24324">He sees himself as a promoter of women — a man whose business deals, like the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them untold opportunities for employment and advancement. “Hundreds and hundreds of women, thousands of women, are the better for it,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="24554">He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief executive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that of the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female worker.</p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="24853"><p>I’ve said, “Why don’t you go home and take it easy now, just go relax.” “No, Mr. Trump, I have to finish this job.” And I said, “Boy, you really are a worker.” And it would just seem that there was something, that they want to really prove something, which is wonderful.</p>

Mr. Trump encouraged the project and followed through on a promise to put her in touch with his production company.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="108" data-total-count="25979">“He genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how he could help,” Ms. Chukanov said.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="25998">A Damaging Critique</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="92" data-total-count="26090">But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting damage on their lives.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="26295">After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very human happened: She gained weight.
