 The inside track on Washington politics.

When Jimmy Kimmel announced his "run" for vice president on Thursday night, you might have thought, "Wait, can you just decide to run for vice president?"

Not really.

And that's kind of the point. In his faux campaign announcement, Kimmel threwÂ some not-so-subtle barbs at Donald Trump. ("All of my campaign merchandise, every bit of it is made overseas. ... I have it made there so Americans can relax. Who the hell wants to make hats?") And he'll likely use his "campaign" as a vehicle to make fun of more candidates as the election goes on -- and real vice presidential picks are made.

But Kimmel is far from the firstÂ comedic personality to "run" for the White House. Stephen Colbert did it in both 2008 and 2012. And while he, too, used it as a vehicle for comedy, Colbert also used his "campaign" as a way to criticize the Citizens United decision (Colbert formed his own super PAC, and routinely used his show to showcase what he saw as an absurd campaign finance system).

But it goes back much further than Colbert. Pat Paulsen, who appeared on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the 1960s, played a straight-man who delivered "editorials" on subjects like Social Security.

When internationally famous comedian Gracie Allen "ran" in 1940, she released a campaign song that went, in part, "Even big politicians don't know what to do / Gracie doesn't know either, but neither do you / So vote for Gracie."

And Will Rogers, who was the kind of American superstar that transcended film, radio and the rest of the pop culture in the 1920s, ran a faux campaign in 1928, promising to resign immediately if elected.

We'll see how Kimmel's "campaign" stacks up.
