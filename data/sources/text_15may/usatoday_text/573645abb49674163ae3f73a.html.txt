President Obama says the United States should look at what other countries do to encourage voting,Â including automatic registration, voting on weekends, orÂ making Election Day a national holiday.

"We are the only advanced democracy that makes it deliberately difficult for people to vote," Obama said in an interview with the student newspaper at Rutgers University, where the president delivers a commencement address this weekend.

Obama noted that "some of it has to do with the nature of our history and our Constitution, where we allow individual states to determine their own processes for structuring elections within certain boundaries."

During a discussion of low voter turnout, aÂ student reporter had asked the president: "In many other countries, the government automatically registers voters and holds elections on days that are weekend days or national holidays. Do you think itâs time for the U.S. to follow their lead?"

"Absolutely," Obama said.

The president noted that some states, such as Oregon, are experimenting with extensions of mail-in voting, on-lineÂ voting, and early voting.

"The single most dramatic political change that could occur in this country â and the best way for us to relieve the frustrations that people feel around the political process âÂ would be if we had greater participation that was more reflective of the day-to-day concerns that people have," Obama said.
