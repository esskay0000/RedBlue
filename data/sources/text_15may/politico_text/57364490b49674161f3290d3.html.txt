President Barack Obama dropped the mic on his last White House Correspondents' Dinner.

 But before declaring "Obama out," the president took a few jabs at his inner circle, as well as the candidates vying to replace him. Here are the top 10 jokes from his set.

Story Continued Below

 1. "What is he doing?" The question over whether Obama would address Donald Trump's candidacy was finally answered Saturday night when the president went all in, wondering why the GOP front-runner was absent.

 "Huh, he's not here tonight. We had so much fun last year," Obama said. "You got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no? Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald?"

 Obama mused about what Trump may have been doing instead: "Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What is he doing?"




 2. Steak or fish The meal choice at the White House Correspondents' Dinner can be a difficult one, especially when presented with only two options: steak or fish. Some Republicans in attendance, Obama said, had some trouble with the options.

 "Asked if you wanted steak or fish, a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan,â Obama said, a veiled hit on Republican primary voters.

 âThat's not an option folks â steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish, but that's your choice."

3. He was happy to see Reince Priebus The president sarcastically congratulated the Republican National Committee chairman on a successful primary season.

 âGlad to see that you feel that youâve earned a night off,â he said. âCongratulations on your success. The party, the nomination process â itâs all going great. Keep it up.â

4. Trump has âplentyâ of foreign policy experience While Trump has been criticized for not having enough foreign policy experience, Obama knows of several foreign âleadersâ Trump has had talks with â Miss Sweden and Miss Argentina.

 âHe spent years meeting with leaders from around the globe.â

5. Trump can close GuantanamoObama insisted that Trump would be able to accomplish one of his goals of closing Guantanamo Bay: âTrump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.â

6. Whoâs the next president?The president pondered over who would be standing behind the lectern at next yearâs event. But he gave us some insight into what heâs thinking: âItâs anyoneâs guess who she will be.â

7. Bloombergâs net worthFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in attendance, and Obama used his presence to mock a different New York billionaire.

Obama said Bloomberg âis actually worth the amount of money he says he is.â

8. Pray for ClevelandOn the Republican nomination process and Trump possibly securing the GOP nod: âThe guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost, and now weâre praying that Cleveland makes it through July.â

9. Answering that 3 a.m. phone callâHillary [Clinton] once questioned whether Iâd be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call. Now I am awake anyways, because I gotta go to the bathroom. Iâm up.â

10. His approval ratings are so highâIn my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide my major.â
