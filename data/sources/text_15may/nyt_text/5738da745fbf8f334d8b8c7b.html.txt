Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urged unity behind Donald J. Trump in a series of interviews on Sunday television shows, calling efforts to draft a conservative to be a third-party candidate a âsuicide mission.â

âYou are not only changing and throwing out eight years of the White House, but you are also throwing out, potentially, generations on the Supreme Court,â Mr. Priebus said on CBSâs âFace The Nation.â He was responding to an article in The Washington Post that outlined efforts among some Republican leaders, dissatisfied with Mr. Trump as the partyâs standard-bearer, to recruit a third candidate to wage an independent bid.

âLook, we could have up to three justices change over in the next eight years, and this is a suicide mission,â Mr. Priebus said. âIt is not right.â

He repeated the argument on âFox News Sundayâ: âItâs a suicide mission for our country, because what it means is that youâre throwing down not just eight years of the White House but potentially 100 years on the Supreme Court, and wrecking this country for many generations,â he said.

Mr. Priebus, who also appeared on ABCâs âThis Week,â defended Mr. Trump against a number of recent controversies, including his resistance to releasing his tax returns and his treatment of women. Asked on âThis Weekâ if Mr. Trump should release his tax returns â an issue that dogged Mitt Romney in 2012, even after he eventually released them â Mr. Priebus argued that Mr. Trump operated under different political norms. âI donât think the traditional playbook applies,â he said. âWeâve been down this road for a year. And it doesnât apply. Heâs rewritten the playbook.â
