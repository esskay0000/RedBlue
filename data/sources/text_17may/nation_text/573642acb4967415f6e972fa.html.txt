LikeÂ a taco bowl from Trump Tower Grill, the Republican Party is being devoured by a demagogue. Now that Donald Trump has wiped out the last of his primary opponents, Republicans find themselves in the awkward position of being expected to take a stance on a presumptive nominee whom many of them despise. Suddenly, theÂ ambiguous distinctionÂ between âsupportâ and âendorseâ has become a point of contention. And while much of the party is rallying around Trump, some Republicans, includingÂ House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (WI) andÂ Senator Lindsey O.

Despite the obvious threat to the country posed by Trumpâs nomination, many Democrats cannot help reveling in their apparent good fortune. Trump has splintered his own party and, with his record of bigotry and misogyny, handed Democrats a powerful weapon to deploy against Republican candidates in competitive races nationwide. But Democrats should tread cautiously as they devise their game plan for the general election. Although SenatorÂ Bernie Sanders (I-VT) plans to stay in the race until the convention, Hillary Clinton is extremely likely to be the Democratic nominee. For Clinton and the rest of the party, though, Trumpâs nomination could present a dangerous trap.		
Given Trumpâs historic unpopularity, some will argue that Clinton should tack to the center in an effort to win over disaffected Republicans and independents. Already, there have been reports that Clinton âis looking for ways to woo Republicans turned off by the brash billionaire,â andÂ her backers have reached out to Republican donorsÂ seeking their support. Yet while the Democratic establishment may be tempted to wage a campaign of âtriangulationââthe centrist strategy that Bill Clinton made famous in the â90sâmoving to the center now would be a lousy idea.
