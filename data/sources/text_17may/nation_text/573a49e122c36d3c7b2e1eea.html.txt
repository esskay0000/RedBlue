Maybe Ted Cruz and John Kasich looked at the numbers and just gave up. Or more likely, Republican grandees decided that short-circuiting the final primaries would deprive Donald Trump of the oxygen of campaigning, thus buying a few quiet weeks to regroup. Instead, the partyâs slowly widening fracture is now a gaping, unbridgeable chasm. The Bushes, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and Lindsey Graham can hold their collective breath untilÂ they pass out; their condemnations only strengthen Trumpâs grip on the news cycle and further embolden his most ardent supporters. This is a candidate who understands only one language: brute animal dominance. Trump has won. A generation of unimaginative and entitled Republican careerists have lost. Period. Itâs Trumpâs campaign, Trumpâs nominating convention, andâfor now at leastâTrumpâs Republican Party.

							While Trump is a captivating celebrity, his electoral appeal—at least thus far—remains narrow.
						
 
That makes it all the more important to recognize that, while Trump is a captivating celebrity,Â his electoral appealâat least thus farâremains narrow. His support cannot be called a movement; he merely stretches the edges of the permanent resentment factionâmostly white, mostly maleâthat has figured continuously in our political scene, in various guises, since the George Wallace campaign of 1968. Often, the resentment faction votes Republican, egged on by Roger Ailesâs Fox News and smart GOP operatives of the Lee Atwater/Roger Stone school, backed up by enthusiastic dog-whistle politicking from mainstream Republican officeholders like Reagan and the Bushes. Sometimes, if the dog whistles arenât loud enough, the resentment faction stays home, as it largely did in 2012. Occasionally, it aligns with a protest candidate like Ross Perot. But itâs always with us.				
					
					
To begin thinking sensibly about the campaign to come, take a close look at Trumpâs numbers in the final primariesânot the percentages for each candidate, but the raw vote. One of the most salient facts of American politicsâso easy to forget in these emotionally charged daysâis that primaries are nearly always spectacularly low-turnout events. Most Americans wait them out, and this year is no different.Â Trumpâs victory in my own state, Connecticut, on April 26, for example, was widely described as overwhelming, since he crushed Cruz and Kasich on the percentages. But that is only because, even in the highest-profile GOP primary in decades, the overwhelming majority of Connecticut Republicans stayed home. Out of 429,000 registered Republicans, in a state with 2.1 million registered voters overall, Trump won Connecticut with just 123,000 votes. In other words he secured what he is now claiming as a âmandate from the votersâ from less than 6 percent of the Connecticut electorate. (Yes, Trump motivated 60,000 more Connecticut Republicans than Mitt Romney did four years ago, but that only speaks to Romneyâs weakness late in the uninspiring 2012 primary, not to theÂ breadth of Trumpâs support.) The same pattern held for the final showdown in Indiana: Trump persuaded 590,000 Hoosiers to pull the lever for him, more than Romney garneredÂ four years ago. But is that really a lot of votes when there are 4.6 million registered voters in the state, any of whom could have declared themselves Republican on primary day under the stateâs rules? Trumpâs knockout blow in Indiana came fromÂ just 13 percent of the eligible primary electorate.

Is it alarming that Trumpâs openly xenophobic and race-baiting campaign has inspired more voters to support him than the career Republicans dancing a bit more politely at the edge of these same resentments? Of course. But Trumpâs primary victory doesnât represent the tyranny of the majority; instead, itâs the hecklerâs veto. If the question is whether the future of American democracy hangs in the balance, that makes all the difference.				
			

							Trump wins only through psychological voter suppression.
						
 
At the same time, it would certainly be foolish to insist, in this year of political surprises, that TrumpÂ canât win. He couldâespecially if, as Thomas Edsall suggested in a carefully reasoned May 11 column, more white voters are keen to pull the lever for Trump than will admit it to pollsters. Trumpâs unlikely but conceivable route to victory lies in only one direction: in the same low turnouts that powered his standing as the presumptive Republican nominee. In other words, by turning the general election into a primary. Trump wins only through psychological voter suppression: a protracted campaign of such ugliness, directed at a Democratic nominee already widely disliked and mistrusted, that vast numbers of voters in key electoral college states become even more alienated from politics than they are now and stay home in November, as they did in March and April. Trumpâs road to the White House is therefore through what Jesse Jackson, describing how low Democratic and African-American turnout helped elect Nixon and Reagan, used to call âthe margin of our despair.â				
					
					
Trump clearly understands all of this. While heÂ may be the most profoundly anti-intellectual candidate ever to seize the nomination of a major American political party, his is in fact a campaign of ideas. He knows that Reagan conservatismâthe three-way unionÂ of free-market economics, cultural conservatism, and muscular military unilateralismâisnât an eternal Republican ideal but rather a product of the last five minutes of history, secured inÂ the early â80s byÂ Reagan operatives purging pro-choice, moderate, and otherwise diverse officeholders from the party. Those five minutes are over now, and every one of this yearâs pols who hitched a ride on the Reagan ideological bandwagon is sitting forlorn by the roadside. In 2016, a Republican other than Trump might have won if she or he had hadÂ the good sense to notice that on cultural issues, corporate globalization, and militarism alike, the groundÂ beneathÂ Reaganism has long since eroded. For all of his narcissism, Trump understands what Cruz, Kasich, and 14 other candidates refused to reckon with: A Republican wins in this era of painful, unprecedented economic inequality by effectively taking everything elseâabortion, gay rights, military expansion, and global free tradeâoff the GOP menu. The problem, of course, is that without those classic conservative issues, all the GOP would have left is racism, anti-immigrant panic, misogyny, and the generalized resentment so often mobilized on conservatismâs behalf. This formula is what Trump has been ready and willing to exploit.

							});
						
Trumpâs triumph and the GOP identity crisis is also a decisive moment for Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party of Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Old-fashioned Democrats like the Clintons (even back when they called themselves New Democrats) like to win the old-fashioned wayâwith voter organizations they can control, closely tied to state-party machinery. Itâs not exactly voter suppression, but itâs not exactly embracing new grassroots constituencies and voter-registration campaigns either. Thatâs why the Democratic Party made the early tactical error of scheduling its presidential debates on low-audience weekend nights. (Why would you want millions of American voters to watch your candidates, for heavenâs sake? They might make up their own minds!) Thatâs why Bill Clinton could, just weeks ago, roll his eyes and speak of Bernie Sandersâs young supporters with unconcealed contempt, even though his wife now needs them in November. This year, that kind of traditional Democratic operation just wonât cut it. In the face of a weary and skeptical public, it will take high turnout across a potent and diverse combination of highly motivated constituenciesâand across the generational divideâto ensure Clintonâs majority in theÂ electoral college if she is the nominee. Todayâs Democratic Party, built primarily to raise money for incumbents, canât deliver that on its own.				
					
					
Unfortunately, the Republican crack-up also lands Hillary squarely in the Clinton comfort zone: campaigning for the Republican, or Republican-leaning, votes. âLetâs get off the red or the blue team. Letâs get on the American team,â she said within days of the Indiana primary. Zigzagging to the right was the key toÂ Bill Clintonâs electoral success in 1992 against the unpopular incumbent George H.W. Bush. It is an understandably tempting playbook. But this year, it would also be a grave error that would suck the Democratic Party and the country intoÂ what is now a RepublicanÂ crisis.				
			

							Hillary and Bill Clinton long ago defined their politics by their own fears.
						
 
Hillary and Bill Clinton long ago defined their politics by their own fears: post-McGovern, Reagan-era fears of being seen as too dovish, too squishy on welfare, too far out in front on gay rights, or simply too bold in advancing a social vision. It was that sort of fear that led Bill Clinton’s administration to fold its cards on one civil-rights issue after the other in the 1990s and to consolidate rather than challenge market deregulation; that drove SenatorÂ Hillary Clinton to vote for the Iraq War; and that motivatedÂ her, as secretary of state, to resist rapprochement with Iran rather than change the game like her successor, John Kerry. President Obama, whatever his flaws, has led the country for eight years with a different styleâso often showing steely resolve to change the terms of debate on key issues, originating in what is clearly a series of personal moral commitments to the American social contract. That is a powerful example, very different from anything on the menu at Camp Clinton.				
					
					
Hereâs the reality: Republican voters uncomfortable with Trump may stay home altogether, or vote the undercard and leave the presidential line blank. A few may even vote for Hillary. But hatred of the Clintons runsÂ deep, rooted equally in unfair Republican smears like Benghazi and in the Clintonsâ own self-inflicted history of unprincipled entitlement, from the 1994 Crime Bill through Hillaryâs Wall Street speeches. Republicans and Republican-leaning unaffiliated voters will not carry Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders, for that matter) to the White House, or secure a Democratic congressional majority.				
					
					
If Candidate Clinton wants to become President Clintonâand wants to secureÂ the congressional support to governâshe needs to start by recognizing the central difference between 1992 and this year. In 2016, the core message among both Democratic and Republican voters is Â âItâs the inequality, stupid.â Deft turns to the right canât address that central reality. Trumpâs victory only escalates the stakes in the argument represented by, but not limited to, Bernie Sandersâs insurgency.

Trumpâs road to the White House is therefore through what Jesse Jackson, describing how low Democratic and African-American turnout helped elect Nixon and Reagan, used to call âthe margin of our despair.â				
					
					
Trump clearly understands all of this. While heÂ may be the most profoundly anti-intellectual candidate ever to seize the nomination of a major American political party, his is in fact a campaign of ideas. He knows that Reagan conservatismâthe three-way unionÂ of free-market economics, cultural conservatism, and muscular military unilateralismâisnât an eternal Republican ideal but rather a product of the last five minutes of history, secured inÂ the early â80s byÂ Reagan operatives purging pro-choice, moderate, and otherwise diverse officeholders from the party. Those five minutes are over now, and every one of this yearâs pols who hitched a ride on the Reagan ideological bandwagon is sitting forlorn by the roadside. In 2016, a Republican other than Trump might have won if she or he had hadÂ the good sense to notice that on cultural issues, corporate globalization, and militarism alike, the groundÂ beneathÂ Reaganism has long since eroded. For all of his narcissism, Trump understands what Cruz, Kasich, and 14 other candidates refused to reckon with: A Republican wins in this era of painful, unprecedented economic inequality by effectively taking everything elseâabortion, gay rights, military expansion, and global free tradeâoff the GOP menu. The problem, of course, is that without those classic conservative issues, all the GOP would have left is racism, anti-immigrant panic, misogyny, and the generalized resentment so often mobilized on conservatismâs behalf. This formula is what Trump has been ready and willing to exploit.

Trumpâs triumph and the GOP identity crisis is also a decisive moment for Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party of Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Old-fashioned Democrats like the Clintons (even back when they called themselves New Democrats) like to win the old-fashioned wayâwith voter organizations they can control, closely tied to state-party machinery. Itâs not exactly voter suppression, but itâs not exactly embracing new grassroots constituencies and voter-registration campaigns either. Thatâs why the Democratic Party made the early tactical error of scheduling its presidential debates on low-audience weekend nights. (Why would you want millions of American voters to watch your candidates, for heavenâs sake? They might make up their own minds!) Thatâs why Bill Clinton could, just weeks ago, roll his eyes and speak of Bernie Sandersâs young supporters with unconcealed contempt, even though his wife now needs them in November. This year, that kind of traditional Democratic operation just wonât cut it. In the face of a weary and skeptical public, it will take high turnout across a potent and diverse combination of highly motivated constituenciesâand across the generational divideâto ensure Clintonâs majority in theÂ electoral college if she is the nominee. Todayâs Democratic Party, built primarily to raise money for incumbents, canât deliver that on its own.				
					
					
Unfortunately, the Republican crack-up also lands Hillary squarely in the Clinton comfort zone: campaigning for the Republican, or Republican-leaning, votes. âLetâs get off the red or the blue team. Letâs get on the American team,â she said within days of the Indiana primary. Zigzagging to the right was the key toÂ Bill Clintonâs electoral success in 1992 against the unpopular incumbent George H.W. Bush. It is an understandably tempting playbook. But this year, it would also be a grave error that would suck the Democratic Party and the country intoÂ what is now a RepublicanÂ crisis.				
			

							Hillary and Bill Clinton long ago defined their politics by their own fears.
						
 
Hillary and Bill Clinton long ago defined their politics by their own fears: post-McGovern, Reagan-era fears of being seen as too dovish, too squishy on welfare, too far out in front on gay rights, or simply too bold in advancing a social vision. It was that sort of fear that led Bill Clinton’s administration to fold its cards on one civil-rights issue after the other in the 1990s and to consolidate rather than challenge market deregulation; that drove SenatorÂ Hillary Clinton to vote for the Iraq War; and that motivatedÂ her, as secretary of state, to resist rapprochement with Iran rather than change the game like her successor, John Kerry. President Obama, whatever his flaws, has led the country for eight years with a different styleâso often showing steely resolve to change the terms of debate on key issues, originating in what is clearly a series of personal moral commitments to the American social contract. That is a powerful example, very different from anything on the menu at Camp Clinton.				
					
					
Hereâs the reality: Republican voters uncomfortable with Trump may stay home altogether, or vote the undercard and leave the presidential line blank. A few may even vote for Hillary. But hatred of the Clintons runsÂ deep, rooted equally in unfair Republican smears like Benghazi and in the Clintonsâ own self-inflicted history of unprincipled entitlement, from the 1994 Crime Bill through Hillaryâs Wall Street speeches. Republicans and Republican-leaning unaffiliated voters will not carry Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders, for that matter) to the White House, or secure a Democratic congressional majority.				
					
					
If Candidate Clinton wants to become President Clintonâand wants to secureÂ the congressional support to governâshe needs to start by recognizing the central difference between 1992 and this year. In 2016, the core message among both Democratic and Republican voters is Â âItâs the inequality, stupid.â Deft turns to the right canât address that central reality. Trumpâs victory only escalates the stakes in the argument represented by, but not limited to, Bernie Sandersâs insurgency.				
					
					
		


							Trump wins only through psychological voter suppression.
						


At the same time, it would certainly be foolish to insist, in this year of political surprises, that TrumpÂ canât win. He couldâespecially if, as Thomas Edsall suggested in a carefully reasoned May 11 column, more white voters are keen to pull the lever for Trump than will admit it to pollsters. Trumpâs unlikely but conceivable route to victory lies in only one direction: in the same low turnouts that powered his standing as the presumptive Republican nominee. In other words, by turning the general election into a primary. Trump wins only through psychological voter suppression: a protracted campaign of such ugliness, directed at a Democratic nominee already widely disliked and mistrusted, that vast numbers of voters in key electoral college states become even more alienated from politics than they are now and stay home in November, as they did in March and April.

Timely and central insight, but the suffering inequality and resentment more Americans experience today is significantly linked to the Bush-Cheney administration&apos;s 8 years in office, and the way the Republicans have shifted their incompetency and blame to the Democrats, for the financial consequences, and slow and unequal recovery.

Clinton has to level with Americans about her political evolution , how she would do things differently, and her clear progressive  objectives for her administration, emphasizing her experience and competence vs. another Bush-Cheney Republican ideologue (like Trump), and the similar catastrophic threats  Trump would present. 

The unnecessary, avoidable, and ongoing Iraq War, at the cost of a 6 Trillion dollar taxpayer financed subsidy to Big Oil and Big Defense, continues to weigh heavily on everyone&apos;s bottom-line, except a few special interests. Add to that the minimum 14 Trillion dollar "Great Recession", that the party of lower taxes and limited government ushered in, after eight years in office as the choice confronting voters today.  The question should not be is not if we want another four years of Obama, but if we want another eight years of Bush-Cheney?

Please drop out Hillary.  Save our country and others by focusing on your foundation to do some real good for the planet. Bernie is a much better candidate and would make a better President and leader of the world. He has a much better chance to defeat Trump.

Hillary Clinton has NOT been nominated. Stop counting unhatched chickens.

The notion that Hillary&apos;s schtick, triangulation, won&apos;t work this year is precisely why she should not be nominated.

She has already demonstrated that she can effectively con many Democratic voters. But that&apos;s not the only universe of voters who will vote in November.

The idea of telling someone on a collision course how to avoid a collision is noble. Telling a self-serving candidate with a stable of sycophants to change their plan -- when there is still time to change candidates -- is just more insanity.

YES. There is one thing that Hilary Clinton can do for America: DROP OUT.

This is the best analysis of Hillary and Bill Clinton&apos;s continual baffling attempts to move the Democratic Party to the right over the past 25 years that I have ever read!  Hillary:  Read this column.  Bernie Sanders is not merely a pain in the rear, he is speaking truths you must recognize.

Somehow, Nation, should get this article directly into Hillarys&apos; hands to read.

I am as true a believer in Bernie&apos;s agenda as any, and have been railing against the Clinton&apos;s brand of DINO politics since the 1992 primaries.  Having said that, it pains me to think that any Bernie supporter thinks that, should Hillary get the nomination (which she is highly likely to), they will consider voting for anyone other than the Democratic nominee.  I have been holding my nose and pulling the lever since 1972 (the last enthusiastic vote I cast for the Democratic nominee for President), and I will do so again.  Why?  2 words:  Supreme Court.  We desperately need to restore sanity to the court, and Donald Trump will not do so.  Hillary is way to interventionist and chummy with Wall Street (and Walmart) for my taste, but at least she will appoint far better justices than any republican or third party joker.  So get real guys and gals: fight on for the Political Revolution, but accept small victories rather than big defeats, if those are the only choices.

I haven&apos;t trusted HRC since 1993, and I have been an outsider to the artifice of the alleged two-party system for decades. I trusted Barack Obama at his word in 2008. much to my regret, and I will never again vote for anyone I suspect to be an establishment candidate - including Drumpf.
Bernie Sanders is the only chance we&apos;ve had in modern history to take our government back from the oligarchs, and he is the ONLY presidential candidate who will get my vote.

David, I so understand this temptation to vote the lesser of the evils IF HILLARY WINS. That uncomfortable choice is part and parcel of our two party system, something so easily fixed, by the way, by instant run-off voting. It seems to me, however, that voting the lesser evil only applies to those progressives unfortunate enough to live in a swing state. Due to the undemocratic idiocy of the electoral college system, those of us who live in solidly blue or red states can vote our conscience. So I, for example, who live in ever so blue CA, can safely vote for Jill Stein (as can a progressive in or fail not red KS). If a progressive lives in Ohio, PA, etc. I take the position of NOT PASSING JUDGEMENT on those folks. They are in a horrible position that I remember well from my days living in (then) swing state MO. It is only for swing state progressives that the Supreme Court argument is applicable, and I feel their pain.

I won&apos;t vote for Clinton merely because she happens to be the Democratic candidate.   This is, in part, why:

The lesser of evils is still evil.

Can we not be quite so quick to assume that it will be Trump vs. Clinton rather than Trump vs. Sanders? A lot can--and will--happen between now and the July convention. Although I am a life-long Democrat, should Bernie lose the nomination, I will immediately change my registration to Independent--just to snub the DNC--and will either write him in or vote for him as an Independent should he choose that route. Hillary will never earn my vote. Never. As Bernie says, "Enough is enough!"

Thank you for your stance, and for your integrity.

I applaud you for standing up for the integrity of your vote.

Those who would try to shame you (us) by saying something about SCOTUS are asking us to compromise our convictions and integrity for the sake of faulty suppositions.

There is FAR more at stake than the uncertainty which remains with Clinton as to whom she would nominate to the highest court.

Two words:  Supreme Court.  The Court will continue to have more sway over our everyday lives than the President and Congress combined.

We must all wait and see if Clinton turns to the right or to the left, and how her words and deeds will be perceived by Sanders supporters.  The remaining primaries will be critical in that calculus.  Sanders momentum could very well accelerate releasing a whole new level of turmoil.  We hard-core Bernie supporters ain&apos;t ready to throw in the towel, and if and when we must, it may not land in the Clinton corner.  A turn to the right by Hillary will cost her lots of those votes.  Then again, will a turn to the left be believable?

Fabulous analysis and perspective - necessary now, more than ever.  Thanks!
