Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter shakes Dr. Henry Kissinger's hand during an award ceremony at the Pentagon on May 9, 2016.  (DoD photo by Senior Master Sgt. Adrian Cadiz)

Kissinger, again. Yesterday Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter honored Henry A. Kissinger at the Pentagon by presenting the former secretary of state with the Distinguished Public Service Award, apparently the highest award the Department of Defense has for private citizens. Carter himself deserves an award for understatement, calling the man who is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of millions of people in Southeast Asia, East Timor, Bangladesh, and southern Africa, among other placesââunique in the annals of American diplomacy.â Kissinger, Carter said, âdemonstrated how serious thinking and perspective can deliver solutions to seemingly intractable problems.â As to allegations of war crimes, âthe fact is,â said Kissinger, he and Richard Nixon âwere engaged in good causes.â

Where to start? Itâs exhausting trying to keep track of what is now a quarterly celebration of the 92-year-old Kissinger. It was just six or so months ago when The New York Times Book Review assigned Kissingerâs preferred authorized biographer to review a Kissinger biography written by Kissingerâs second-choice biographer. A âmasterpieceâ! the first said of the second. And then, three months ago, Hillary Clinton, in a debate with Bernie Sanders, cited Kissingerâs recommendation as a referral for the White House.		
At the time, Clintonâs remarks seemed a misstep, allowing Sanders an opening to criticize her catastrophic interventionism in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Now, though, it is clear that Clintonâs invocation of Kissinger wasnât a fluke but rather a preview of a general election strategy to run to Trumpâs right on foreign policy and win over the hawkish wing of the Republican Party. âThe candidate in the race most like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney from a foreign-policy perspective,â Republican strategist Steve Schmidt recently said, âis in fact Hillary Clinton.â		
It would be pointless to provide yet another recitation of the many miseries Kissinger caused around the globe during his long run in public office from 1969 to 1977. By now, those who want to know his atrocities know his atrocities. Even his authorized biographer, Niall Ferguson, doesnât deny that Kissinger is a criminal but rather mitigates the crimes by comparing them to other crimes: âNearly a hundred times as many people,â Ferguson writes, âdiedâ as a result of John Foster Dullesâs actions in Guatemala as âwere âdisappearedâ in Chileâ after the 1973 coup vigorously encouraged by Kissinger, yet âyou will search the libraries in vain for The Trial of John Forster Dullesâ (Ferguson apparently hasnât yet read the books by David Talbot and Stephen Kinzer). Kissinger is implicated in at least three genocides (Cambodia, Bangladesh, and East Timor) and, give or take, 4 million deaths.

Kissingerâs unusually high body count and singular moral imperiousness has the effect, among his critics, of obscuring his didactic utility. An outsized personality who has committed outsized mayhem, Kissinger eclipses his own context. Yet as animals were to the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, Kissinger is good to think with.		
Kissinger celebrants inevitably point to two things to justify their admiration: an opening to Chinaâârapprochementââand improved relations with the Soviet UnionâdÃ©tenteâwhich included SALT, a historic arms-limitation treaty. These initiatives are often described as the pillars of his âgrand strategy,â stabilizing the post-Vietnam international order and allowing the United States, the Soviet Union, and China to stake out spheres of influence.		
Letâs grant these two achievements to Kissinger (even though scholars of foreign relations question just how central he was to either). If these policiesâpurportedly enacted to stabilize the interstate systemâhad been allowed to mature, one could imagine a number of salutary effects. In the United States, for instance, Washington could have demilitarized in the wake of the Vietnam War, using funds that would have gone into the military budget to recapitalize domestic infrastructure and nonmilitary research and development, making possible a different kind of response to the 1973â75 economic crisis, a value-added, good-paying, mass-industrial public policy rather than the âfree tradeâ race to the bottom that was put into place. But they didnât have a chance to mature, and they didnât because of, at least in part, the actions of Henry Kissinger.		
In the realm of foreign policy, in the years following the end of the Vietnam War, Kissinger, in one region after another, executed policies that helped doom his own grand strategy, undermining dÃ©tente and canceling out whatever steadying effect it might have provided the planet. In southern Africa, for instance, Kissinger supported civil wars that would last decades and kill millions. In the Middle East, he pointlessly provoked the Soviet Union and laid the foundation for the jihadists. The militarization of the Gulf, including the brokering of ever larger arms sales to Saudi Arabia in exchange for petrodollars, was a Kissinger initiative, one that was enthusiastically continued by all subsequent secretaries of states, including Hillary Clinton (see this essay I did for TomDispatch, drawn from Kissingerâs Shadow, on Kissingerâs consequential post-Vietnam turn toward the Middle East).

Domestically, Nixon and Kissinger, as they themselves put it, intentionally used foreign policy to âbreak the backâ of domestic opponents and âdestroy the confidence of the people in the American establishment.â They had mixed results with the former (Nixon did win a landslide reelection in 1972, though he was subsequently driven out of office), but succeeded, stunningly, with the latter, beginning the erosion of confidence in the âestablishmentâ (see Trump, Donald).

Under Nixon and Ford, Kissinger constantly invoked Weimar Germany to warn liberals about the âbrutal forces in the society,â the âreal tough guys,â who were waiting in the wings. Kissinger, Kissinger said, was the only thing standing between them and the fascists (thatâs why, one of his rationales goes, he had to bomb Cambodia, as blood tribute to a rising New Right). Well, by 1980, he was with those brutes. Endorsing Ronald Reagan in 1980, Kissinger threw in with Americaâs new militarists, who would jump-start a revived Cold War and drive to retake the Third World.		
That the policies Kissinger would hand off to his successors were morally indefensible is a matter of opinion. Less contestable is the claim that he left the world polarized and, in the long-run, volatile, despite the short-term stability of the jackboot. In a way, Kissinger did to the larger Third World what he did to Cambodia: He institutionalized a self-fulfilling logic of intervention. Action led to action, reaction demanded more action. Just as his secret bombing so roiled Cambodiaâs borders that, by early 1970, it made a major land invasion using US troops seem like a good idea, Kissingerâs global postâVietnam War diplomacy so inflamed the international order that it made the neoconsâ radical vision of perpetual war look like a reasonable option for many of the worldâs problems.		
Zack Beauchamp over at Vox had a good summary of Kissingerâs war crimes, though the premise of the essayâs titleââThe Obama Administration Is Honoring Henry Kissinger Today. It Shouldnât Beââis exactly backwards.		
Of course the White House should be honoring Kissinger, since it runs its endless war by Kissingerâs rules. The right to bomb neutral countries the United States isnât at war with in the name of national security is now unquestionably accepted across the foreign policy spectrum, as is the right of the White House to engage in extrajudicial assassination at will (Kissingerâs illegal Cambodia bombing set a precedent, but he also lent critical legitimacy by supporting Reaganâs bombing of Libya, George H.W. Bushâs invasion of Panama and Gulf War I, and George W. Bushâs Gulf War II).		
At 92, Kissinger, after picking up a few more honorifics and celebrating a few more star-studded birthdays, will soon go to his grave eulogized by President Hillary Clinton, at a funeral attended by Samantha Power, knowing that heâs won.

Start Making Sense: Hillary Clinton Is Donald Trumpâs Dream Opponent

Bernie Sanders Keeps Winning Primaries and Keeps Shaping the Anti-Trump Agenda

These Haunting Photos Show the Deadly Absurdity of the US-Mexico Border Wall

Get Ready for a Wave of Green Civil Disobedience, America

Kissingerâs unusually high body count and singular moral imperiousness has the effect, among his critics, of obscuring his didactic utility. An outsized personality who has committed outsized mayhem, Kissinger eclipses his own context. Yet as animals were to the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, Kissinger is good to think with.		
Kissinger celebrants inevitably point to two things to justify their admiration: an opening to Chinaâârapprochementââand improved relations with the Soviet UnionâdÃ©tenteâwhich included SALT, a historic arms-limitation treaty. These initiatives are often described as the pillars of his âgrand strategy,â stabilizing the post-Vietnam international order and allowing the United States, the Soviet Union, and China to stake out spheres of influence.		
Letâs grant these two achievements to Kissinger (even though scholars of foreign relations question just how central he was to either). If these policiesâpurportedly enacted to stabilize the interstate systemâhad been allowed to mature, one could imagine a number of salutary effects. In the United States, for instance, Washington could have demilitarized in the wake of the Vietnam War, using funds that would have gone into the military budget to recapitalize domestic infrastructure and nonmilitary research and development, making possible a different kind of response to the 1973â75 economic crisis, a value-added, good-paying, mass-industrial public policy rather than the âfree tradeâ race to the bottom that was put into place. But they didnât have a chance to mature, and they didnât because of, at least in part, the actions of Henry Kissinger.		
In the realm of foreign policy, in the years following the end of the Vietnam War, Kissinger, in one region after another, executed policies that helped doom his own grand strategy, undermining dÃ©tente and canceling out whatever steadying effect it might have provided the planet. In southern Africa, for instance, Kissinger supported civil wars that would last decades and kill millions. In the Middle East, he pointlessly provoked the Soviet Union and laid the foundation for the jihadists. The militarization of the Gulf, including the brokering of ever larger arms sales to Saudi Arabia in exchange for petrodollars, was a Kissinger initiative, one that was enthusiastically continued by all subsequent secretaries of states, including Hillary Clinton (see this essay I did for TomDispatch, drawn from Kissingerâs Shadow, on Kissingerâs consequential post-Vietnam turn toward the Middle East).

Domestically, Nixon and Kissinger, as they themselves put it, intentionally used foreign policy to âbreak the backâ of domestic opponents and âdestroy the confidence of the people in the American establishment.â They had mixed results with the former (Nixon did win a landslide reelection in 1972, though he was subsequently driven out of office), but succeeded, stunningly, with the latter, beginning the erosion of confidence in the âestablishmentâ (see Trump, Donald).

Under Nixon and Ford, Kissinger constantly invoked Weimar Germany to warn liberals about the âbrutal forces in the society,â the âreal tough guys,â who were waiting in the wings. Kissinger, Kissinger said, was the only thing standing between them and the fascists (thatâs why, one of his rationales goes, he had to bomb Cambodia, as blood tribute to a rising New Right). Well, by 1980, he was with those brutes. Endorsing Ronald Reagan in 1980, Kissinger threw in with Americaâs new militarists, who would jump-start a revived Cold War and drive to retake the Third World.		
That the policies Kissinger would hand off to his successors were morally indefensible is a matter of opinion. Less contestable is the claim that he left the world polarized and, in the long-run, volatile, despite the short-term stability of the jackboot. In a way, Kissinger did to the larger Third World what he did to Cambodia: He institutionalized a self-fulfilling logic of intervention. Action led to action, reaction demanded more action. Just as his secret bombing so roiled Cambodiaâs borders that, by early 1970, it made a major land invasion using US troops seem like a good idea, Kissingerâs global postâVietnam War diplomacy so inflamed the international order that it made the neoconsâ radical vision of perpetual war look like a reasonable option for many of the worldâs problems.		
Zack Beauchamp over at Vox had a good summary of Kissingerâs war crimes, though the premise of the essayâs titleââThe Obama Administration Is Honoring Henry Kissinger Today. It Shouldnât Beââis exactly backwards.		
Of course the White House should be honoring Kissinger, since it runs its endless war by Kissingerâs rules. The right to bomb neutral countries the United States isnât at war with in the name of national security is now unquestionably accepted across the foreign policy spectrum, as is the right of the White House to engage in extrajudicial assassination at will (Kissingerâs illegal Cambodia bombing set a precedent, but he also lent critical legitimacy by supporting Reaganâs bombing of Libya, George H.W. Bushâs invasion of Panama and Gulf War I, and George W. Bushâs Gulf War II).		
At 92, Kissinger, after picking up a few more honorifics and celebrating a few more star-studded birthdays, will soon go to his grave eulogized by President Hillary Clinton, at a funeral attended by Samantha Power, knowing that heâs won.

Just a post-script here:  I read recently that the Kissingers and the Clintons always spend Christmas together; and Hillary claims that Henry complimented her on how she ran the State Department.  [I rest my case.]

Genocide = Distinguished Public Service? 
That proves it: this world is another world&apos;s hell.

Goes to show that Obama and Hillary are no better than Nixon or Reagan or Bush when it comes to supporting genocide abroad and opposing democracy at home and and overseas. No way will I be voting for Hillary at any time or any place now or in my lifetime for any reason whatsoever. It is foolish to think that the neocons in the democratic party are any better or safer to have in office than neocons from the republican party. They have the same financial backers and serve their interests and not those of Americans.

This election cycle has blown back the curtains for an unprecedented display of the fetid Kabuki Dance that I now must fully recognize is the mode and method of the USAâs ulterior bipartisan political Establishment. With this latest obscenity, this alleluia to the war criminal Henry Kissinger, I am finally done with Democrats too. If this cycle plays-out as it is shaping-up, my next Ideological Gesture will likely be to join with the Monkey Wrench Tribe and vote for Trump as a way to indicate that Iâm more willing to experience a Turd-tossing Monkey at the helm of our Ship of State, than any vetted politician who is a product of this System. With a Trump win, Iâm assured that ONE very good result will occur; the USAâs current status on the international stage will be diminished. At a minimum, Trumpâs election will cause a harsh blow to the USAâs reputation, influence, and âleadershipâ abilities among the planetâs Nations.

I, too, believe this is a Hillary play. Obama has been showing his hand here for awhile. It is disgusting and immoral.

I hope the door hits O&apos;Bummer in the ass on the way out.
Historians will chronicle a horrible legacy for him, possibly worse than Slick Willy&apos;s.

Unbelievable!

What&apos;s next? Posthumous Congressional Medals of Honor for Benedict Arnold and Jefferson Davis?

Thank you, Ralph Novy for your totally appropriate response to HK&apos;s honor.  I couldn&apos;t figure it out at first, but now I understand that nearly EVERYone these days will do ANYthing to enhance Hillary&apos;s PR, including the Nation which accepts and "prints" hundreds and hundreds of Hillary ads every day.   Money DOES talk, doesn&apos;t it?

The one good thing about the ads on the Nation is that clicking through on an ad costs the advertiser more than just displaying it. I click *all* of the Hillary ads I see online.

Niall Ferguson pointed out in his authorized biography that Henry Kissinger toured extensively throughout the then Republic of South Vietnam in 1965 for LBJ, and he came to the realistic conclusion the war was essentially over since it could not be won militarily. Yet Kissinger prolonged the war during his tenure as Richard Nixon&apos;s national security adviser.

Yes, absolutely and those of us in the Army during that time watched in horror.

One can only wonder why some war criminals end up on gallows (Nuremberg), while others are honored and eulogized.  Like Olympian gods, winners are beyond reproach.

The award to Kissinger appears to be an attempt to shore up Clinton&apos;s campaign by making Kissinger look like a decent person so her claiming him doesn&apos;t hurt her. The rigged system continues!

Like any kid who grew up during Viet Nam and the Nixon era I loathed Kissinger as much as I loathed Nixon.  But those looking to tie him to Hillary Clinton are being less than truthful with what we know.  Hillary fake-bragged in one of her debate appearances that even he complimented her about how she organized the bureaucracy of the State department.   In her last memoir, she similarly boasted in an ironic way that she was able to work across party lines, drinking with McCain or probing Kissinger on the opening of China.  That is the context and substance of this fabled relationship Bernie Sanders and supporters love to dredge up these past few months.  Hillary Clinton is every inch the child of the 60s and 70s that many of us who read the Nation are, worked to impeach Nixon and protested against the Nixon/Kissinger war.  When she boasts of being able to even get along with Dr. K, she is saying that working across the aisles is something she can do, using McCain and Kissinger as powerful examples of enemies she can still work with.  Similarly, Obama was elected saying the same thing: that we are not Blue America and Red America but only the United States of America, with all needed emphasis on &apos;united&apos; and working together with people we disagree with to forge solutions and possible consensus.  Doing that involves being polite and respectful and reaching across the aisle, honoring each other&apos;s heroes and standard bearers and hearing each other out.
The indignation here that Obama would acknowledge an old man&apos;s service across the aisle is classically myopic and wrong-headed.  So, yes he is one of our bad guys here on the left.  But lets grow up a little and try and understand the right&apos;s need to salute him.  Bernie&apos;s public statements about Kissinger only showed how adolescent his attitude is, how unsteady a leader he would be, and how badly he would botch working with others across Washington, the country and internationally.

If by "United" you mean "Single, oligarchic party" then you&apos;re right on.

Child of the 60&apos;s; Goldwater girl.

Oh, so Hillary gushing over Kissinger just means she&apos;s a wide-eyed 60&apos;s gal who doesn&apos;t really know all of Kissinger&apos;s evil-doings, and it&apos;s OK -- she and Obama are just recognizing that the right adores him and  showing they can "reach across the aisle."  Did you read the story?  Or even the headline?  One of the vilest, evilest figures in the history of America was just awarded a Distinguished Public Service Award!

Oh, yeah. "Working across the aisles" has been SUCH a successful strategy for Obama.

Hooey.

And yet that is what he ran on and promised: no red, no blue, but rather a united America, and to lower the volume of discord.  Obama and Hillary understand exactly who and what Kissinger is but try to remember that presidents and secretaries of State have many duties and obligations that we readers of the Nation do not have.  presidents talk with presidents from the past, help unveil their official portraits, and mark the peaceful continuation of democratic government by helping to mark those who have served before.
Those in this comment stream who want to blame Hillary or say all this is to let Hillary off for her making civil remarks about Dr. K show their crazy misogyny: why not blame Obama or Kerry?  The manic blaming of Hillary for every aspect of policy really I amazing and revealing.  It&apos;s a profound break with reality and sexist to its very core.  The inability to see how crazy it is and how sexist it is then is just further evidence of the delirium and delusion.  
To think that Obama does this without caring about Kissinger&apos;s role in the Viet Nam era is ridiculous, but to think that modern presidents don&apos;t have to respect other people who have served other presidents and the country, or to acknowledge the Salt talks and opening to China just shows how little you understand what the presidency is, and how it carries tremendous challenges.  Once the inauguration takes place a divinely left-leaning hero like Obama is constitutionally obligated to represent everyone and not just his voting base.  He needs to safeguard the continuity of government, that his accomplishments won&apos;t be ravaged the second he leaves he must therefore respect the administrations of the past, exercise politesse and decorum and show up to honor old men he critically disagrees with.  Only idiots think otherwise.

No one reached back, precisely as the Tea Party newbies and Mitch McConnell wanted.  Obama really never learned this lesson; and sadly did not censure the near-treasonous perps.

It&apos;s hard to come up with an American as despicable as Henry Kissinger.  Nixon is the only one who comes to mind, particularly because of the dance of death the two of them concocted together.  They were the two prime-dogs in a very vicious pack.  The world will be a better place once Henry the K is dead and gone.  And the establishment (Ash Carter, Hillary), despite all the exposure, continue to sing his praises.  Yuk!

Great comment - this award is truly appalling - it also shows that the current administration is  tarnished as well.

An infuriating but essential read. Thank you for writing it, Gregg Grandin.

Sorry I misspelled your first name.

We supposed Obama twice, the disappointments continue, listen to the Nixon tapes Kissinger and Nixon prolonged the Vietnam war for political reasons, withdrawal would jeopardize Nixon&apos;s reelection and they both agree the war cannot be won, it is on the tapesfro the date of the tapes more than 23, 000 American troops died and millions of Asians died, re illegal bombing of Cambodia and Laos WAKE UP AMERICA
