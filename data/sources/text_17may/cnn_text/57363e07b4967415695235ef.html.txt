 (CNN)Is Sen. Elizabeth Warren the first Democrat to beat Donald Trump at his own Twitter game?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

Do you think you're going to shut us up, @realDonaldTrump? Think again. It's time to answer for your dangerous ideas.

But here's the thing. You can beat a bully -- not by tucking tail and running, but by holding your ground.

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He's so confident about his "counter punch" he waited until Friday night. Lame.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.

No, @realDonaldTrump - your racism, sexism & xenophobia doesn't drive me nuts. It makes me sick. And I'm not alone.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

We get it, @realDonaldTrump: When a woman stands up to you, you're going to call her a basket case. Hormonal. Ugly.

You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?

You're so concerned about Wall Street, @realDonaldTrump, that you say you'd "absolutely" repeal Dodd-Frank?

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman's card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet "when a woman stands up to you..."
