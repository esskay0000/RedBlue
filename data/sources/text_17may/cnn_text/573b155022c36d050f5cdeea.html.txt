 (CNN)Marco Rubio fired off an extended series of tweets late Monday night, alternating between sharp jabs and light jokes, aimed at a pair of Washington Post reports about his plans for his political future and his alleged "hate" for the Senate, a word the Florida senator disputes.

As for future in politics, well it's nearly impossible for someone not in office to ever become a successful candidate for President.Right?

I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January.

Funny to read about unnamed "people close" to me who claim to know my thinking on future plans.They just make it up. https://t.co/jiEYMugVHz

Flashback to another article quoting a "longtime friend" saying I "hate" Senate. Words I have NEVER said to anyone. https://t.co/VZ9J7wznsZ

Unnamed sources "close to" often just people who want to sound like they are in the know. And reporters desperate for content just accept it

Word of advice, people often claim to know more than they really do because they enjoy status of being perceived as "in the know".

A source "close to Rubio" says he was tired after long day & has decided to sleep for a few hours before tomorrow's ZIKA debate in Senate.

A "longtime friend" says Rubio is "betwixt and between when it comes to whether to chest or legs tomorrow at gym."

According to source who knows his cousins, wife's dentist, Rubio could do cardio instead.

Ok that's enough for one night. Twitter isn't something you should just rush back into. You have to slowly increase the dosage.......

This is a very promising development. Just in time for my return to Twitter. https://t.co/nj6gbFJDkz
