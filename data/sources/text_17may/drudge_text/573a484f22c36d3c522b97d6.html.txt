Itâs the ultimate in extreme sex – parties where one person secretly has HIV, and everyone has unprotected sex without knowing who it is.

Doctors in Barcelona have claimed that ‘sex rouletteâ parties taking place, usually among gay men – and it echoes previous reports of such parties among wealthy people in Serbia.

The âthrillâ comes from knowing you might be infected, people who claim to have attended such parties say.

Dr Josep Mallolas of Hospital Clinic Barcelona says that the parties are a sign that people have âlost respectâ for HIV, in a report in el Periodico.

Mallolas says, âThere is everything: sex roulette parties, or sex parties you can only attend if you already have HIV.â

Mallolas says that some of the parties are known as âblueâ parties because attendees take anti-viral medication to cut the risk of transmitting the virus.

Last year, a Serbian stripper called Tijana claimed that the parties originated in Serbia – and were named Serbian sex roulette, after Russian roulette.

She said, âThis bizarre variation that seems popular for extreme sex. People who turn up for the party wear masks, and one of them has HIV.

âThe wealthy organise these sex parties for other rich people. The real kick for these people is apparently the risk that they might be the one having sex with the HIV-infected partner.â
