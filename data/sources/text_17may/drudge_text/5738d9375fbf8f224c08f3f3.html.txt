Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced undefined âmilitary exercisesâ for the embattled nation, just a day after pledging to prolong his governmentâs special emergency powers.

Speaking in Caracasâs Ibarra Square after a march Saturday by several hundred supporters, Maduro said his opponents are orchestrating foreign military intervention in Venezuela. Exercises by the army and militia groups would prepare âfor any scenario,â Maduro said.

âThe oligarchyâs plan is to disturb the peace so they can justify foreign intervention in Venezuela,â Maduro said in televised remarks at the rally. âIâm not an extremist for saying this, but theyâre extremists for wanting to carry this out.â

Maduroâs moves added to the sense of political and economic tension gripping the country beset by the worldâs highest inflation, shortages of basic goods, and currency controls. Supporters of opposition groups who are urging a presidential recall vote demonstrated simultaneously on Saturday.

Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said on May 12 that Venezuelaâs opposition may need protection from outside armed forces. On Saturday, Maduro pledged legal action against Uribe, without giving details.

The announcement of military drills follows Maduroâs decision Friday to extend an emergency period that grants his administration greater autonomy in drafting national policy. Opposition politicians, who have controlled Venezuelaâs congress since December, say Maduroâs move to expand his autonomy is illegal and have pledged to block it.
