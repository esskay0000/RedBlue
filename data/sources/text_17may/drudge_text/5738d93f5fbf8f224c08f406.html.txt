It is a soulful ballad about love and loss, sung by a pretty soprano who made her first recordings at the age of just nine.

NowÂ Ukraineâs Susana Jamaladinova has won the 61stÂ Eurovision Song Contest 2016Â with her song,Â 1944 that laments Stalin's deportation of more than 240,000 ethnic Tatars from Ukraine's Crimea region during the Second World War.Â 

While her entry earned huge applause when it beat five other rivals in a live television show, it did not go downÂ so well in Russia, to whom is a none-too-subtle rebuke for the invasion of Crimea two years ago.Â 

The singer, known asÂ Jamala, was said to have been inspired by the memories of her great grandmother, who was deported from the peninsula with her five children in 1944 along with 240,000 other Tatars. 

Jamaladinova, an ethnic Tatar born in Kyrgyzstan, wept tears during her victory at the national final, where she performed in traditional Tatar dress before a crowd waving Tatar and Ukrainian flags.Â 

While her song avoids direct reference to Vladimir Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ms Jamaladinova, whose stage name is Jamala, has left no-one in any doubt about where her sympathies lie.Â The lyrics begin:

"When strangers are coming/
They come to your house/
They kill you all/
And say/
We're not guilty/Not guilty."
Â 

Russian officials and some politicians in Crimea have complained that the song was intended to denigrate Russia. But the Geneva-based organisers decided the song was not in breach of the competition's rules against political speech.

"Musicians should express their feelings, their real feelings, not sing meaningless words like we hear all the time," said the artist, defending the song in Stockholm.

In an interview with the AFP news agency in February, she said wanted people to hear a song written "in a state of helplessness" after Russia's seizure of her land.

"It was hard for me to recall all these memories again and again, but I understand that it is necessary now," she said. "Because now the Crimean Tatars are desperate and they need support."

Stalin deported the Tatars after accusing them of collaborating with Hitler, although Ms Jamaladinova says her own relatives fought on the Soviet side. When the Soviet Union collapsed, many returned to Crimea, where in 2014 they becameÂ vocal critics of the Russian annexation.

n 2009, a year after Russia's war with Georgia, the Georgian entry "We Don't Wanna Put In" was deemed unsuitable because of its obvious play on the Russian president's name. Georgia was told it could amend the lyrics, but chose not to enter the contest at all.

Russian entries were booed by some audiences at Eurovision in 2014 and 2015, apparently over both Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and Mr Putin's record on gay rights.

In 2009, the Russian president even proposed working with China and Central Asian allies to restart the Intervision Contest - a Soviet era version of Eurovision that ran during the late Seventies.

The proposal has thus far been postponed.
