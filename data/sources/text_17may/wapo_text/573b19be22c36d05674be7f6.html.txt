For Rand Paul, back in Kentucky after a failed presidential bid, itâs all about the money.

The Republican senatorÂ is expected to easily win his Senate primary on Tuesday, setting the stage for what the GOP hopes is a repeat performance of his home state colleague MitchÂ McConnellâs crushing defeat against Alison Lundergan Grimes in 2014. Issues like the Senateâs inaction on President Obamaâs latest Supreme Court nominee, or even Donald Trump â Paul has said he will support the Republican nominee â have received little attention from his two primary opponents.

But Paul needs to start fundraising in earnest for what may turn out to be a tough general election againstÂ likely Democratic rival Jim Gray, the mayor of Lexington.

Gray, who gained personal wealth from running his familyâs Lexington-based construction firm, raised $750,000 and loaned his campaign $1 million in the first quarterÂ of the year while Paul raised $530,000. Both Paul and Gray had $1.5 million cash on hand, though Gray later cut a check on his first statewide television ad buy.

Before February when Paul dropped out of the presidential contest, the senator was focused on bringing in funds for that campaignÂ and his Reinventing a New Direction âRANDâ political action committee. The group, which still had about $54,000 cash on hand at the end of the first quarter, cannot fund Paulâs Senate campaign but can help pay for other expenses.  

Since returning to Kentucky, Paul finds himself trying to play a bit of catch up in the money chase.

âDo I wish Rand had more than a million and a half in the bank right now? Yes,â said Scott Jennings, a Kentucky Republican operative with ties to McConnell. âThen again, he wasnât out raising money for the Senate race â¦ Rand Paul needs to raise more money. I know they are out ramping up and rebuilding.â

Itâs a change of gears for Paul, the 53-year-old son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). The libertarian-minded senator won less than five percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses, and lacking strong support and financing amid a crowded field, chose to refocus his attention on reelection in his adoptive home state.

In a victory for Paul, the Kentucky Republican Party agreed to hold a presidential caucus in March as well as Tuesdayâs primary, allowing Paul to mount runs for the White House and the Senate at the same time. The senator agreed to pay for the caucus, though by the time it happened, he was no longer running for president.

Now, his message to voters is much the same as it was in his first campaign, when he ran as an insurgent against the Washington establishment: smaller government, less regulation, lower taxes. Paul is still stressing criminal justice reform, an issue that is making slow progress in the Senate. And since Hillary Clinton said sheâs âgoing to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,â heâs been hammering the loss of Kentucky coal jobs. (Clinton later apologized for her comment.)

The contest in November is not expected to attract the intense media scrutiny or vast political spending that did the McConnell-Grimes race. But Paulâs Senate campaign still has enlisted top talent from Kentucky political circles, including former McConnell finance director Laura Haney, to help ferret out dollars.

This week, the senator is expected to raise funds on the sidelines of the National Rifle Association convention in Louisville, where he will speak alongside Trump, McConnell, Trump backer Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Paulâs one-time presidential rival Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).

A campaign spokeswoman, citing Paulâs official town halls in close to 60 counties across the state, said heâs âhitting his stride.â

  [If the 2016 presidential candidates were âGame of Thronesâ characters .â.â.]  

âWeâve been in Senate mode for a quite a while,â said Kelsey Cooper, who rejected the idea that Paulâs focus has not been on Kentucky. âHe was in Senate mode while he was running for president, too. He maintained a 96-percent voting record and he was still doing events in Kentucky, keeping incredibly busy.â

Paulâs presidential ambitions have made him an easy target for national Democrats eager to weaken a Republican figure who will be difficult to oust in November.

The Paul campaign argued the fundraising disparity between Paul and Gray will not matter as the race heats up. Gray is competing Tuesday against six Democratic primary rivals.

Paulâs primary, in contrast, has been unusually quiet. There have been no ads from his rivals and no debates, a rarity for Republican candidates facing angry grassroots voters this year.

Gray spokeswoman Cathy Lindsey said Paulâs national fundraising network is âseemingly not pulling through for him.â

âThis speaks to his weak position as an incumbent,â Lindsey said in a statement. âHere in Kentucky, he is seen as not only out of touch with Kentuckians, but out of the mainstream of what is good for Kentucky â focusing only on his own ambitions.â
