The Senate on Tuesday is poised to approve more than $1 billion in new funding to help fight the spread of the Zika virus.

Senators will have the opportunity to vote on three funding options, including a popular bipartisan compromise that would provide $1.1 billion, as amendments to a broader spending bill that is expected to passÂ later this week. The vote comes amid growing concern that the virus could spread rapidly as the mosquito population grows this summer.Â Zika has been linked to birth defects and health issues across LatinÂ America and the Caribbean, including parts of Mexico and Puerto Rico.

There is broad bipartisan support for the $1.1 billion compromise package, but lawmakers will also have the opportunity to vote on an option that would fully fund the White Houseâs $1.9 billion request and a separate GOP-backed proposalÂ that wouldÂ use $1.2 billion in cuts to an Affordable Care Act program to offset the cost ofÂ $1.1 billion in new Zika spending.

The funding package and the underlying spending bill are expected to easily pass the Senate, but prospects for passing the legislation through the House are dim.

On Monday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) introduced legislation to provideÂ $622.1 million to battle Zika over the next five months. The package redirects moneyÂ leftover from battling the Ebola virus and other programs run by the Department of Health and Human Services to a Zika fund.

Rogers said his proposal would be available immediately, but does not provide funding for the following year. Rogers and other GOP leaders have not ruled out additional funding but said theyÂ want the administration to first provide an exact accounting of how itÂ plans to use any new funds.

âGiven the severity of the Zika crisis and the global health threat, we cannot afford to wait on the Administration any longer,â Rogers said in a statement. âWe have made our own funding determinations, using what information is available and through discussions with federal agencies, to craft a proposal to fight the spread of this damaging disease.â

House Democrats rejected the proposal immediately.

âThe Republican majorityâs response is completely insufficient given the severity of the public health emergency facing the Western Hemisphere,â said Rep. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
