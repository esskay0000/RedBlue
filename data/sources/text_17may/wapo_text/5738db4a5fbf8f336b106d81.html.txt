In mid-March, The Fix team was delighted to its nerdy core on learning that news of Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court had prompted a surge in people looking up the meaning of terms such asÂ "summa cum laude," an academic distinction Garland had earned.

  [The top-trending words on MerriamWebster.com will warm your politics-loving heart]  

NowÂ look atÂ the top 10 list from MerriamWebster.com as of Friday.



With the exception of Choaspes (a proper noun and the name of a riverÂ flowing from what is nowÂ Iran to Iraq thatÂ was mentioned in a widely used Bible study text), every single one of these words has dominated the news (often political news) in recent weeks, according to the word trend-watchers over at Merriam Webster. The No. 1 trending word â transgender âÂ leads the top 10 list because of a more than 630 percent spike in look-ups at MerriamWebster.com on Friday. That followed an announcement by the Obama administration that a letter would be sent to public schools issuing guidance on transgender access to school bathrooms.

To put a finer point on it, interest in the term has been growing for some time. On Nov.Â 3, when voters in Houston defeated a measure that would have banned a number of forms of discrimination in the workplace and public facilities, and includedÂ the option for transgender individuals to use the public restrooms of their choice, searches for the term climbed 70 percent. The following day, when the measure's failure was national news, look-ups surgedÂ 69 percent. Between April 20 and 30, afterÂ news that the Oxford, Ala., City Council planned to and then did approve a measure that would criminalize transgender people'sÂ use of public bathroomsÂ that do not correspond to the sexÂ listed onÂ theirÂ birth certificate a crime, look-ups spiked an average of 141 percent each day.

So, there you have it. Americans are paying attention.
