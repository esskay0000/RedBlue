THE BIG IDEA: Burlington College is feeling the burn.

Bernie Sanders is huge on college campusesâor yuuuuge, as he likes to sayâbut the small private school in Vermont that his wife, Jane, ran for seven years announced yesterday that it will shutter because of âthe crushing weightâ of debt incurred under her leadership.

Burlington College said its financial troubles are connected to Mrs. Sandersâs 2010 purchase of 32 acres of lakefront property, part of a botched expansion plan. The college was placed on academic probation in 2014 by its accrediting agency and it faced cash flow problems due to the imminent loss of a line of credit, The Postâs Nick Anderson reports. To survive, the school has tried to sell land but it was not enough to remain solvent.

Jane Sanders was president from 2004 until 2011, when she stepped down amid an apparent dispute with the collegeâs board. She left with a $200,000 severance package.

-- Mrs. Sanders has become an increasingly prominent figure in her husbandâs campaign. The onetime community activist routinely travels with him and has become a ubiquitous surrogate on cable TV.

-- The failure of Burlington College gives credence to two arguments routinely made by the Clinton campaign and its allies:

First, Bernie and Jane were insufficiently vetted by the mainstream media. Many reporters have passed on writing up opposition research hits about the Vermont senator, or focusing on the problems at the college, because they did not believe he ever had any realistic chance of being the nominee. The Clintons, owing to their status as the front-runners and former occupants of the White House, have continued to command a more intense level of scrutiny.

Second, Sanders is making fantastical promises that are unfeasible. Eventually someone has to pay the bills for his promised ârevolution.â Studies published last week by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Urban Institute concluded that Sanders's plans are short a total of more than $18 trillion over a decade. âHis programs would cost the federal government about $33 trillion over that period â¦ yet he has put forward just $15 trillion in new taxes,â Wonkblogâs Max Ehrenfreund explained.

Not only would most of his ideas be dead on arrival in Congress, but many observers wonder whether the septuagenarian socialist even fully understands how the economy works. His inability to explain how heâd break up the big banks during the disastrous sit-down with the New York Daily News editorial board last month remains a good data point in the case that he is in over his head on policy.

-- The Sanders campaign has ignored repeated requests for comment on Burlington Collegeâs failure. The uncharacteristic silence is telling.

-- This morningâs clips are brutal for the Sanders campaign, especially on the day of two must-win primaries:

The Burlington Free Press: âIn response to reporters' questions about a possible law enforcement probe into the college's finances, [President Carol A. Moore and Dean Coralee Holm] declined to comment.â

Politico: âThe college was also on the Education Departmentâs list of colleges that are subject to extra scrutiny â known as âheightened cash monitoringâ â as recently as March 1, for issues relating to âfinancial responsibility.ââ

Vanity Fair: âThe financial failure of Burlington College presents a jarring contrast with the upbeat, optimistic message of the Sanders campaign â¦ While Sanders has inspired millions of young supporters with his promise to eliminate college debt, his wifeâs decision to hike tuition in order to pay for a costly campus expansionâa big factor in the rise of college tuition throughout the countryâcasts Bernieâs hopeful policy proposals in a more complicated light.â

The Atlantic: âJane Sanders holds a doctorate in Leadership and Policy Studies from the Union Institute, a nontraditional school that critics sometimes call a diploma mill. Union made national headlines during the 2012 campaign because Marcus Bachmann, husband of then-Representative Michele Bachmann, also received his doctorate there."

CNN: A loan application that Jane signed apparently overstated the amount of pledged donations Burlington College had when acquiring the land. The school took a $6.7 million loan. The Vermont Journalism Trust first reported last year that she told Peopleâs United Bank that the college had $2.6 million in pledged donations to support the purchase: âThe college, however, received only $676,000 in actual donations from 2010 through 2014 â¦ Burlington College also cited a $1 million bequest as a pledged donation that would be paid out over six years, even though the money would only be available after the donorâs death.â

The Washington Free Beacon reported in January that, when Jane was president, the college also enrolled students at a woodworking school run by her daughter and spent more than half a million dollars on the endeavor, which ended not long after she left.

Jane has also profited off Bernieâs campaigns: She received $91,020 between 2002 and 2004 for "consultation" and to negotiate the purchase of television and radio time-slots for Sanders' advertisements, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported in 2006.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- The Koch political network promises to spend more than $42 million on ads in key Senate races through the end of September. âThe network's latest foray: a $2.2 million television and digital campaign in Ohio targeting former governor Ted Strickland, who is running against GOP incumbent Sen. Rob Portman,â Matea Gold reports. The news of the expanded spending comes in the wake of a National Review report that the Kochs are retreating from the kind of intense national political activity they conducted during the last three election cycles. Officials push back against that notion, saying the network is and will continue to be âfully engagedâ in 2016 political and policy battles.

-- The horrific Amtrak wreck that killed eight people and injured 159 in Philadelphia last year could have been prevented if safety hardware installed on the train had been switched on. Transpiration officials will today announce the results of their year-long investigation. Ashley Halsey III and Michael Laris have a preview.

-- Two national polls that came off embargo at 6 a.m. show good news for Trumpâ

-- Marco Rubio turns media critic. 

The Fixâs Chris Cillizza put the Floridian on a list of âfive people who are never going to be Trumpâs vice presidentâ: âRubio, according to conversations I've had with people close to him, is sort of betwixt and between when it comes to his next move. Despite some urging to reconsider his plans to retire from the Senate, Rubio seems likely to stand firm and head out in November. What's next is the harder nut to crack. Rubio has said he isn't interested in running for governor in [2018] and would have a far-from-clear primary field since state Agricultural Commissioner Adam Putnam has been planning a gubernatorial bid for much of the past decade. Rubio could stay in the private sector and make money â he has four young children â but the danger there is by the time 2018 rolls around he is out of the daily, weekly or even monthly conversation happening within the GOP. Still, Rubio, like Ted Cruz, is young enough not to need to take a risk like signing on with Trump.â 

From 11:17 p.m. to 12:27 a.m., Rubio tweeted 11 responses. Highlights:

Word of advice, people often claim to know more than they really do because they enjoy status of being perceived as "in the know".

A "longtime friend" says Rubio is "betwixt and between when it comes to whether to chest or legs tomorrow at gym."

According to source who knows his cousins, wife's dentist, Rubio could do cardio instead.

I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January.

The upshot of the tweet-storm seems to be that Rubio believes he can run for president in 2020 without holding elected office: 

As for future in politics, well it's nearly impossible for someone not in office to ever become a successful candidate for President.Right?

Heâs almost certainly referring to Ronald Reagan, whose term as governor of California ended in 1974 and then ran for president as a private citizen in both 1976 and 1980. John Edwards, who left the Senate after 2004, tried it in 2008, with less successâ¦

The senator had tweeted little since dropping out of the presidential race in March. Then, on Saturday, he criticized NBCâs "Today" show for shadowing him on a tour of a HUD project in Florida only to ask him about âpolls and Trump.â But he couldnât have disliked the piece that much: He linked to it.

Agreed 2 bring @TodayShow on tour of HUD project run by slumlord. They turn it into campaign piece. https://t.co/CjWJ1SaZNm via @todayshow

GET SMART FAST:ââ

-- Damning under-oath testimony gives fodder to Democratic claims that voter ID laws are really just sinister ploys to suppress the vote. The Madison Capital Times covers a court fight over whether Wisconsinâs voter ID law, signed by Scott Walker, was designed to reduce non-white turnout in order to boost GOP prospects. âThe trial began with former Republican legislative staffer Todd Allbaugh testifying that not only was that the intent, but some lawmakers were âgiddyâ to do so: â[Then-Sen. Dale] Schultz, who did not seek re-election in 2014, voiced some opposition to the bill and what it might do to voting rights, Allbaugh said. His opposition was met by a spirited defense from then-Sen. Glenn Grothman, now a member of Congress. âAt that point, Sen. Grothman cut him off and said, 'What Iâm concerned about is winning. You know as well as I do the Democrats would do this if they had power â¦ so we better get this done while we have the opportunity.ââ

CAN TRUMP CHANGE?

-- After long saying he would never hire a pollster, Trump hired a pollster. Tony Fabrizio previously worked for Bob Dole, Rick Perry and Rick Scott. Last summer on âMeet the Press," Trump said he does not need to âwaste moneyâ on pollsters. âI donât want to be unreal. I want to be me.â (Sean Sullivan)

Fabrizio, for his part, used to mock Trump on Twitter...before he went on his payroll:

@daveweigel @BobbyJindal @realDonaldTrump was that before or after his dad had to buy $3 mill in chips to bailout his casinos???

-- âThe top ranks of the Republican Party may be coalescing around Trump, but grassroots conservative activists are still trying to find a way to stop him at the partyâs convention in July.â From Ed O'Keefe and David Weigel: âAngered by Trumpâs shifting views on taxes â¦ conservatives across the country are studying the party rule book for last-ditch moves they could make when the convention begins in Cleveland. Veteran Republican campaign operatives familiar with convention planning are offering to educate delegates on how they can act as free agents, even if the RNC insists that delegates adhere to the results of their state primary.â The convention rumblings come at the same time that some Republican elites continue what appears to be a futile search for someone to mount a third-party challenge to Trump. Conservative activist Erick Erickson said most of the concerned Republicans he talks to are focused on finding ways to âunbindâ delegates required to vote for the winner of their state. Some favor changing party rules in the week before the convention.

-- Leading Republicans are increasingly anxious that Trump is lagging far behind Clinton when it comes to having an organized network of big-money allies, Matea Gold reports: âBecause Trump condemned such entities throughout the primary, top donors remain unsure about where to send their checks â¦ That leaves Trump advisers, GOP strategists and major donors puzzling over a key strategic question: Where should the six- and seven-figure contributions go?â

The free-for-all environment alarms the strategists who have signed on to help Trump: âThe lack of a major super PAC vehicle is a source of concern among top Trump advisers, some of whom have contacted experienced strategists in recent weeks to gauge their interest in launching a new entity ... Such outreach is potentially risky, since federal law prohibits a candidateâs agent from establishing a super PAC.â 

When asked if he was aware of such talks, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski wrote in an email, âMr. Trump continues to disavow all Super PACâs.â Matea notes that this unequivocal statement will probably further confuse major donors, who interpreted Trumpâs softening rhetoric on super PACs as a sign that he was open to their support.

-- Trump is scheduled to meet with Henry Kissinger tomorrow in Washington. The face-to-face session comes after weeks of phone conversations with the former Secretary of State, Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: âTrumpâs conferring with Kissinger underscores not only how he is building relationships with Republican elders but how he leans toward a more realist view of international affairs, which has long been the bailiwick of Kissingerâs work.â

-- Trump vowed that, as president, he would rescind Obamaâs new directives aimed at protecting transgender people against discrimination in schools and health-care coverage, Philip Rucker and Robert Costa report. But even as Trump accused the administration of federal overreach, he also offered a more nuanced outlook than many of his Republican leaders: "It is a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the population," Trump told The Washington Post, saying he was âstudyingâ the issue âvery closely.â

-- Trump ally Roger Stone admitted that the real estate mogul posed as his own publicist in the early 1990s, despite the candidate's denials: âTrump wanted to get his spin and his side of the story, so he handled the press call himself, probably because he didnât want to pay a public relations expert,â Stone told Breitbart. âWhat difference does it make?â (Buzzfeed)

-- A reporterâs Trump Tower interview was allegedly canceled when the campaign heard him speaking Spanish. From Buzzfeed: âMarcos Stupenengo, a freelance correspondent working for TV Azteca, got an interview with Trump â initially. He had no trouble when he asked to come to Trump Tower in New York on Monday to interview the bombastic presumptive Republican nominee. But as he waited to conduct the interview, Stupenengo received a call, and began speaking in Spanish. Thatâs when the Trump campaign informed him they had no interest in taking part in an interview with him â¦ Stupenengo, who is from Argentina, studied journalism there before going to school in New York. He has green eyes and would appear to many as a non-Hispanic white male.â

-- John Kasich ruled out a third-party presidential bid, putting an end to speculation that the Ohio governor would enter the race against Trump. "I'm not gonna do that," he said on CNN. "I gave it my best where I am. I just think running third party doesn't feel right. I think it's not constructive." Kasich reiterated he will not serve as Trumpâs running-mate, and said it would be âvery hardâ to endorse the real estate mogul. "It would be very hard for me â unless he were to change all of his views and become a uniter â¦ to get in the middle of this thing,â he said.

-- Ted Cruz continues to talk like a candidate on Capitol Hill, strongly hinting at a 2020 presidential bid. From David Weigel: âOn Monday, Cruz's campaign sent supporters a video tribute to itself, with footage of the operative, spokesmen and volunteers who gave the better part of a year to him. Cruz himself appears in the video giving an emotional pep talk to his staff, limning it with references to the future. âRonald Reagan, in 1976, came up short,â said Cruz. âI suspect, at that convention, there were a few tears shed." The video, which ends with the words âTo Be Continued,â also continues the theme of Cruz's post-campaign rhetoric: that nothing about his message needs to change. "The 2016 primary season, already, is described as a fluke where Cruz outworked everyone but an out-of-control media anointed Trump.â

-- Another Republican senator is trying to carefully parse language between âsupportingâ and endorsingâ Trump as nominee: Wisconsinâs Ron Johnson said he intends to âsupportâ the presumptive Republican nominee. âWhen asked if he was concerned about endorsing a wild card,â Johnson differentiated between supporting and endorsing a candidate. He noted that he purposefully says, âI intend to support.ââ (TPM)

PRIMARIES TODAY IN KENTUCKY AND OREGON (135 Democratic delegates are on the line: 74 in OR, 61 in KY.)

 

-- Clinton is fighting unexpectedly hard in Kentucky. She added two additional days of campaign stops in hopes of stopping Sanders from racking up an unbroken string of victories. Abby Phillip reports that the Clinton campaign has begun to feel optimistic she can close the gap in large part because Kentucky holds a closed primary, shutting out independents who heavily favor Sanders. She has consistently performed well among registered Democrats â even in West Virginia, where she lost overall to Sanders but won 49-45 among those who are registered Democrats.

-- In Oregon, voter registration could surge to its highest rate in decades: Democratic registration surged 16 percent from September through April, The Oregonian reports, boosting the party to 42 percent of Oregon's total electorate, compared to 38 percent less than a year ago.High voter turnout -- coupled with an electorate similar to next-door Washington State -- should make the Beaver State amenable for Sanders. But Oregon also has a closed primary, meaning voters must have registered with Democratic Party before its April 26 deadline. (Clinton has a perfect 8-0 record in closed primary states, Fox News notes.)

In anticipation of this hurdle, Sandersâ campaign launched a major voter registration initiative: Staffers began moving to the state a month before the party registration deadline, targeting university towns and reaching out to young voters. âSometimes they placed calls from home; other times they gathered at field offices,â the LA Times reports. âPart of the challenge was simply explaining the closed primary process to voters.â

Now the question is what the new registrations will add up to: The most recent polling in the state showed Clinton widely leading Sanders with 48 percent to his 33 percent, per Portland-based DHM research. âEven when the firm ran the numbers with higher turnout among young and new voters, two target audiences for Sanders, Clinton was still up by 7 points, outside the margin of error of 5.6 percentage points.â

Oregonâs âmotor voterâ policy could adversely affect predicted turnout: âUnder a new DMV system, voters are automatically registered as âunaffiliated,â and later receive a form in the mail giving them the option to change their party affiliation or opt out entirely. The vast majority â 76 percent â did not take that extra step by the late April deadline, and thus canât participate in the presidential primary.â (Talking Points Memo)

-- While Clinton continues to struggle because of her promise/gaffe to put a lot of coal miners out of work, her campaign has begun to reach out to Kentuckyâs small but reliable African American voting population. âAfrican Americans make up more than 20 percent of the population in vote-rich cities such as Louisville, in Jefferson County. Unlike eight years ago, when Clinton lost the county to Barack Obama, she could show unexpected strength against Sanders in one of the stateâs liberal enclaves.â

Kentucky strategist Dale Emmons said he expects turnout to be âmodest at bestâ due to primary-season fatigue. âLow-turnout elections will often hand you surprises,â he said.

Clinton said at a diner yesterday, "I'll tell you this, I'm not going to give up on Kentucky in November!" This is funny. Whatâs your over/under for how many times she actually returns to the Bluegrass State? One?

COLORFUL STORIES THAT BEFIT THE CULTURE OF EACH STATE:

-- Kentucky Senate Minority Leader Ray Jones (a Democrat) is seeking to distance himself from both Obama and Clinton amidst a competitive -- and odd â primary challenge in the eastern part of the state. Challenger Glenn Hammond criticized Jones in an advertisement as a âliberal career politicianâ who supported Obama for election twice. âHeâll vote for Hillary,â Hammond said of Jones. âI wonât.â And for his part, Jones put out an ad calling Hammond a âcloset liberalâ who had donated âbig moneyâ to Obamaâs war on coal. (Amber Phillips)

-- In Portland, Wiccans who support Sanders gathered in support of the Vermont senator, chanting âfeel the Bern,â thanking four âcardinal directors,â and fostering general good vibes for the election. (The Oregonian)

-- A new super PAC partnership between billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, the AFL-CIO and major public sector employee unions has triggered an angry backlash among the building trade unions -- dividing organized labor just as it ramps up its 2016 political programs. From Matea Gold: In letters to AFL-CIO president President Richard Trumka, presidents from eight building trade organizations called on the AFL-CIO to cut ties with Steyer, whose environmental agenda is seen as a threat to infrastructure projects such as Keystone XL pipeline. The dispute underscored the rift between two of the most loyal constituencies in the Democratic Party. At issue is a new super PAC called For Our Future that Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, is financing in conjunction with the AFL-CIO and others. âAs part of the partnership, Steyer has agreed to match the donations that the unions put into the group, helping amplify labor's resources. The organization plans to mobilize voters in key Senate races and presidential battleground states."

WAPO HIGHLIGHTS:

-- Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly sat down with The Post to discuss the dark days that followed Trumpâs nasty put-downs. From Krissah Thompson's revealing interview:

-- âHouse chairman wants to prevent women from entering the draft,â by Karoun Demirjian: âThe chairman of the House Armed Services Committee this week will try to strip language from legislation he oversees that would require women to register for the draft, blaming himself for not stopping the proposal from getting in the bill in the first place.â Rep. Mac Thornberry said he âdidnât probably do everything I should haveâ to keep an amendment that would enact the policy change from being added to the annual defense policy bill â¦ âBut in order to give the full House a chance to vote on the matter, Republican leaders will have to go through a few procedural calisthenics because it could run afoul of the chamberâs rules regarding the cost of legislation. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that including women in the draft actually lowers government costs by reducing spending on Pell Grants. Itâs against House rules to offer an amendment that would raise the cost of legislation.â Thornberry told the Post editorial board he plans to offer an amendment to strip language in the bill, because members âhavenât had a chance to look at this.â

-- âJudge orders Mississippi school district to desegregate, 62 years after Brown v. Board of Education,â by Emma Brown: âA federal judge has ordered a school district in the Mississippi Delta to desegregate its middle and high schools, capping a legal battle that has dragged on for more than five decades. The Cleveland School District is divided by railroad tracks that separate white families, who largely live west of the tracks, from black families, who largely live to the east. Its secondary schools reflect that division: There is one all-black middle school, for example, and one all-black high school, with all-white schools just over a mile away. As the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi put it, Cleveland â¦ has been running an illegal dual system for its black and white children, failing year after year to reach the âgreatest degree of desegregation possible.ââ

SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:

â ZIGNAL VISUAL: Bette Middler steals the show. Monday was a rare day in the race for president: One of the few days when somebody Tweeting about Trump received more attention than Trump himself. Monday it was Bette Midler, who compared the presumptive GOP nominee to Australian hip-hop artist (and Swaggy P fiancee) Azealia Banks. Midler has about 900,000 Twitter followers, and was retweeted more than 17,000 times. Her post was seen by as many as 44 million people worldwide, according to Zignal Labs analytics. (The other top Trump tweets were all from Trump himself.)

Twitter deactivated Azealia Banksâ account for homophobia & racism?So why is Donald Trump still here?

Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes declined an invitation to testify before Congress amidst a continuing firestorm over comments he made about the Iran deal in a New York Times Magazine profile, Mike DeBonis reports. Here is a taste of the GOP reaction:

WH informed me @rhodes44 will not testify. Talks to reporters and his "echo chamber" but not Congress. Disappointing but typical.

On Friday @PressSec said this was not about Executive Privilege. Today @rhodes44 can't answer because of EP. Who precisely is inconsistent?

After Breitbart's David Horowitz called Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol a "renegade Jew" in a story, the phrase began trending on Twitter:

#RenegadeJew trending on Twitter https://t.co/DLRKDeNDXX pic.twitter.com/i9zo5TWno4

The slur against Kristol was widely condemned, including by the Anti-Defamation League:

We are disappointed that @BreitbartNews invoked Bill Kristol's religion in #RenegadeJew headline. So inappropriate and offensive.

.@Slate's Michelle Goldberg is right: Breitbart's #renegadeJew," is anti-Semitic dog whistle https://t.co/SAkXTJcwif

I wake up and ask: Why is #renegadejew trending? Oy. When you've got to choose between Breitbart and Kristol...maybe go back to bed?

Come for the anti-Semitic headline, stay for the insistence that Ted Cruz's father met Lee Harvey Oswald pic.twitter.com/orDAUsHSej

Breitbart goes to full white nationalism. https://t.co/DAtY7yGojW

Kristol jokes that he's been watching the "Renegade Jew" music video on a loop. "Speaks to me," he deadpanned.

I'd assumed the new party should be called the New Federalist Party or The New Whig Party. But now I'm thinking, The Renegade Party...

The Renegades disdain to conceal their views and aims. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Renegade revolution...

Trump's manager denied a report that he is working on a book:

Despite false reports to the contrary, I am not writing a book. I am under a strict confidentiality agreement with Mr. Trump.

Trump continues to slam the New York Times for its Sunday story about his treatment of women. An ex-girlfriend quoted in the piece went on Fox to complain about the story and then the candidate himself called into CNN's control room to make sure producers at the rival channel caught it.

That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!

The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!

The pushback continued this morning:

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history

The Washington Examiner's Byron York called the Times story "not particularly effective":

The piece is clearly breaking through, perhaps because Trump keeps drawing more attention to it:

Donald also continues egging on Bernie:

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.

DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz seized on the story:

 It is commencement season & this year I feel deeply honored and grateful to the students to be invited to give 3 university commencement addresses. Yesterday I spoke at the university my dad graduated from: North Carolina Central University. This coming Friday I'm overjoyed to be speaking at home in Jersey at William Paterson. Today I spoke at George Washingon. This picture is from right before the program began, I walked up to the students as they were marching in & took a bunch of pictures & selfies with graduates. Speaking today on The Mall for GW is one of the highlights of my year. I have such reverence for The Mall for reasons I am sure many Americans share. But it is also the place, right by The Jefferson Memorial, where my parents had their first date - and 6 or so years later, after that very good date, I was born. I spoke to the graduates about this & those words at that memorial, "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and sacred Honor." Americans aren't called to "tolerate" each other. Our nation was founded with the idea, (made more inclusive by generations of struggle) that we need each other, that we each have value; the idea that if we are to make it we must pledge to each other our best. Our calling as Americans isn't to just tolerate one another, to stomach our differences, but to go beyond tolerance, to love one another and recognize our worth and pledge to each other our best, our sacred honor. We don't always have to like or agree but Patriotism, love of country, necessitates that we love and show acts of love to our countrymen and women; knowing that despite our differences that we need each other like the old African saying, "If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together." Today I called on the graduates (and myself) to love - not simply in grand gestures and acts but in the small ways - the way we treat others, how we extend kindnesses and grace to those we encounter and how we don't fall into indifference or apathy about the struggles & injustices of those fellow Americans around our towns, cities, states & nation. May we all be better at having "malice toward none and charity for all."

GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:

-- Arrested for stealing $5.05 of sweets and soda, a 24-year-old who doctors repeatedly diagnosed as psychotic and delusional was left to essentially starve to death over four months in a squalid Virginia jail. From CNN: âBy the time [Jamycheal] Mitchell died in August -- officially, of a heart condition â¦ jail staff had allegedly denied him many meals, cut off the water to his cell and left him naked with no bedding or shoes â¦ Mitchell lost about 40 pounds during his time in jail, documents say. A medical examiner said he was ânearly cachectic,â meaning his weight loss could not be reversed via nutrition.â Inmates said they pleaded with guards to help Mitchell during his stay, but their pleas were ignored or disregarded, according to the lawsuit. âAs long as he doesn't die on my watch,â one inmate recalled being told.â Jamycheal Mitchell's aunt is demanding a jury trial and at least $60 million in a lawsuit that alleges willful and wanton negligence and five counts of civil rights deprivation.

-- Colorado Senate candidate Jon Keyser acknowledged for the first time that his campaign submitted forged signatures to qualify for the Republican primary ballot. He broke his silence to distance his candidacy from the building controversy yesterday after a disastrous, Rubioesque debate performance last week. From the Denver Post: âThe former state lawmaker blamed an employee hired by a canvassing firm connected to his campaign and suggested the issue will not hurt his once-promising bid because he collected more than enough voter signatures to qualify for the race. âIt appears, in fact, that some of those signatures were turned in in an improper manner, and that's a very, very serious thing," Keyser said â¦ two weeks after questions enveloped his campaign. "I think that speaks to why I was very measured and very disciplined in talking about this.â The Keyser campaign submitted at least 10 voter signatures later discovered as forgeries to meet a 1,500-signature threshold to qualify for the ballot. The Denver district attorney's office is conducting a review into the accusations of fraud.

HOT ON THE LEFT:

âWoman mistaken for transgender harassed in Walmart bathroom,â from Connecticut Post: âAimee Toms was washing her hands in the womenâs bathroom at Walmart in Danbury Friday when a stranger approached her and said, âYouâre disgusting!â and âYou donât belong here!â After momentary confusion, she realized that the woman next to her thought - because of her pixie-style haircut and baseball cap - that she was transgender â¦ Besides being a pretty normal choice of style for women, Tomsâ has a short haircut because she recently donated hair - for the third time - to a program that makes wigs for child cancer patients.â

HOT ON THE RIGHT:

âSuper PAC Seeks IRS Audit of Clinton Foundation,â from the Wall Street Journal: âThe conservative super PAC American Crossroads said Monday it filed a complaint with the IRS requesting an audit of the Clinton Foundation, following articles last week about how the foundation aided a for-profit company part-owned by people with ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton.â The articles documented the Clintonsâ ties to owners of a company that benefited from a $2 million commitment coordinated by the Clinton Global Initiative. 

DAYBOOK:

On the campaign trail: Sanders is in Carson, Calif. Clinton and Trump are off the trail.

QUOTE OF THE DAY: 

Reince Priebus said Trump understands âweâve got to have a real seasoned veteranâ as his running-mate. âThere has to be a degree of diversity on the ballot,â the RNC chair told radio host Hugh Hewitt. âNow whether it be diversity of age, or whether it be diversity of gender, or ethnic background. Somehow or another, diversity is important in some respects.â

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:

-- âGet out the rain gear (you probably didnât put it away) and get ready to trudge through another rainy morning and afternoon.â The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: âPeriods of rain combine with very cool conditions as highs only manage the middle to upper 50s. Thatâs 15 to 20 degrees below normal! Breezes are light and clouds are ample.

-- A D.C. Council supermajority said it will overhaul Mayor Muriel E. Bowserâs plan to lease private property for homeless shelters, calling it a âwaste of tax dollarsâ that would fail to permanently solve the District's growing epidemic of homeless families. (Aaron C. Davis)

-- Police stepped up patrols in Southeast D.C. after two homicides occurred just blocks apart. Authorities believe the murders may be connected. (Peter Hermann, Clarence Williams and Martin Weil)
