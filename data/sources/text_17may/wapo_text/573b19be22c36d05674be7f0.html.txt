The Volcker Alliance, named for Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, has named a new president â Thomas W. Ross, president of the University of North Carolina (UNC) system until he was forced to resign in January.

Volcker started the organization three years ago to promote effective implementation of public polices and to restore trust in government. Under Rossâs leadership, Volcker said he doesnât expect a change in direction, âbut with his expertise, he can provide some momentum that maybe nobody else can provide.â

Ross also was president of Davidson College and served as a North Carolina Superior Court judge for 17 years and as director of the stateâs Administrative Office of the Courts. He was chief executive of the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation and will continue in his role as the Terry Sanford Distinguished Fellow at Duke Universityâs Sanford School of Public Policy.

No reason was given for his forced resignation, according to dailytarheel.com, except the board of governors felt it was time for a new leader.

After he begins July 1, Ross said he will try to âshine a lightâ on government ineffectiveness, but also highlight things that work well. During separate phone interviews, Volcker and Ross emphasized the Alliance will continue working with colleges and universities on the need to produce graduates well prepared to shape and execute public policy.

âThereâs lots of talk about policy,â Volcker said. âThere isnât much talk about the execution of policy.â

That sentiment is reflected in the organizationâs motto that Volcker said he took from Thomas Edison: âVision without execution is hallucination.â
