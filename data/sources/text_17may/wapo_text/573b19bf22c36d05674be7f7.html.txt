The House Judiciary Committeeâs decision to hold hearings a week from today onÂ whether to impeach IRSÂ Commissioner John Koskinen is a victory for the chamberâs far-right caucus, still smarting over the agencyâs treatment of conservative groups.

Over five years, House Republicans have slashed the IRS budget, passed bills banning employee bonuses and prohibiting employees fired for misconduct from getting rehired. The GOP has vowed to simplify the tax code, pounced on agency management failures and assailed customer service failures caused by the budget cuts.

And last week, anti-IRS lawmakers convinced previously hesitantÂ House leaders to start the unusual process of removing the tax collector from office.

One of the biggest questions now is whether the 76-year-old tax commissioner will show up for the grilling. IRS officials said Monday they have made no decision on whether Koskinen will accept the Judiciary committeeâs invitation to appear May 24 and at a hearing in June.

âThe IRS continues to discuss hearing logistics with the House Judiciary Committee,â the agency said in a statementÂ provided by spokesman Dean Patterson. Koskinen has cooperated with four congressional investigations stemming from the IRSâs handling of applications from conservative groups, the statement said, âand will continue to do so.â

âCommissioner Koskinen has also said previously that he has testified fully, truthfully and to the best of his ability during his numerous previous congressional hearings on this matter.â

The GOPâsÂ seven-month effort to oust Koskinen,Â whose term does not end until November 2017, is nonetheless a long shot, experts say,Â given the short congressional calendar remaining before the November electionsÂ and procedural hurdles.

Impeachment ofÂ an agency leader is rare. The last time Congress brought similar articles of impeachment was in 1876, after the House uncovered evidence of a pattern of corruption byÂ War Secretary William Belknap.

But by allowing hearings to go forward, House leaders are lettingÂ IRS opponents keepÂ their constituentsâ frustration with an unpopular agency in the foreground â and a good political target in their crosshairs.

The two congressmen leading the chargeÂ for impeachment, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), chairmanÂ of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, had for months receivedÂ little traction with Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), But things have shifted, at least partway.

[Top Republican to IRS: You say youâre broke. How can you afford 700 new employees?]

âA lot of people have to warm up to the ideaâ of impeachment, Chaffetz acknowledged in an interview. âBut weâre not letting go of this one.â

The effort stemsÂ fromÂ 2013, when the IRS inspector general reported that the tax-exempt division gave extra scrutiny toÂ conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. Partisan hearings and investigations by Congress preceded Koskinen, a fix-it executive from the corporate world President Obama brought in to clean up the damage.

But Republicans accuse Koskinen of covering up his staffâs mistakes in providing information to House investigators who asked for emails written by the central official in the scandal, Lois Lerner. In articles of impeachment Chaffetz filedÂ last October, he charged that KoskinenÂ erased backup computer filesÂ containing thousands of emails written by Lerner.Â KoskinenÂ had told lawmakers his staffÂ turned over all of the relevant emails, and when someÂ were found to be missing, said they were unrecoverable.

TheÂ Justice Department formally closed its investigation of the targeting scandal last fall without filing criminal charges.

âDespite repeated congressional efforts to get to the bottom of this matter, Obama Administration officials, including the IRS Commissioner, have consistently undermined the investigation,â Goodlatte said in a statement on the Judiciary Committee website. The hearings âwill closely examine Commissioner Koskinenâs misconduct and the implications of his actions.â

Chaffetz, Jordan and several other IRS detractors serve on the committee, andÂ Chaffetz said he expects to testify against Koskinen next week. At the Â June hearing, outsideÂ experts are expected to weigh in on whether impeachment is warranted.

Chaffetz has beenÂ inÂ conversations withÂ colleagues about a vote on the lesser but still harsh charge of a censure. He reiterated his support for censureÂ this week, calling the hearings a good way to lay the groundwork. But he said he and Jordan still will press Ryan to bring impeachment to the House floor.

But a partisanÂ impeachment could be a distraction during the volatile presidential campaign. Congress has relatively few legislative days left on the calendar, and they are likely to be taken up byÂ more pressing issues.

The House has impeached just 19 public officials, includingÂ 15 federal judges, the war secretary, a senator and Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, according to the Congressional Research Service.Â The Senate has conducted 16 full impeachment trials: Half resulted in convictions of federal judges.

Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means oversightÂ panel, told Politico earlier this month that proceeding with impeachment is not realistic.Â âBy mid-July, the congressional year will essentially be done,â he said.
