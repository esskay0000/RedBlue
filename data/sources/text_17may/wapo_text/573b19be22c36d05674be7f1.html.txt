The picture of a stern-looking Uncle Sam, finger pointed forward, casts a lasting image above the words: Â âI want YOU for U.S. Army.â

The poster, originally published during World War I, marks one of the more memorable advertising campaigns in American history.

But now, a century later, a government review of Defense Department recruitment advertising finds Pentagon efforts lacking.

A report by the Government Accountability OfficeÂ says âbetter coordination, performance measurement and oversight [is] needed to help meet recruitment goals.â

As GAO previously has found in a number of other government activities, âunnecessary duplication, overlap and fragmentationâ in Pentagon recruitment efforts âmay result from the absence of coordination,â according to the report.

âFor example, the Air Force has three advertising programs that contract with three advertising agencies, but officials could not provide a rationale for requiring separate programs.â

And, unlike the Marine Corps, which can assess the impact of its advertising, the Army does not have data to evaluate whether its advertising is effective.

âWithout fully measuring advertising performance, especially at the local levels,â GAO said, âDOD may be unable to ensure advertising dollars are used efficiently to help meet recruiting goals.â

The lack of oversight can lead to controversy.

Last November, Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Arizona Republicans, released a report critical of the Pentagon practice of paying sports teams to honor service members.

âIn 2013,â the senatorsâ report begins, âa roaring crowd cheered as the Atlanta Falcons welcomed 80 National Guard members who unfurled an American flag across the Georgia Domeâs turf. Little did those fans â or millions of other Americans â know that the National Guard had actually paid the Atlanta Falcons for this display of patriotism as part of a $315,000 marketing contract. â¦ This kind of paid patriotism is wholly unnecessary and a waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, and it must end.â

Noting this type of practice was âlater deemed unacceptable by DOD,â GAO said âthe absence of DOD oversight may have contributed to some activities of questionable appropriateness. â¦Without a department-wide policy that clearly defines its oversight role, DOD lacks reasonable assurance that advertising is carried out in an appropriate manner.â

The Pentagon generally agreed with GAOâs recommendations.

âSpecifically,â according to GAO, âDOD concurred with our recommendations aimed at improving coordination and providing more direction to military service advertising.â

By the way, the Library of Congress says the âI want YOUâ poster was âoriginally published as the cover for the July 6, 1916, issue of Leslieâs Weekly with the title âWhat Are You Doing for Preparedness?âÂ â
