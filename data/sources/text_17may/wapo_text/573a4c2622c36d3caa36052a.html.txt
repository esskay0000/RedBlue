NEW YORK -- Donald Trump is scheduled to meet here Wednesday with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger as the Republican Partyâs presumptive presidential nominee looks to develop his foreign-policy expertise, according to three people close to Trump.

Kissinger has long been the GOPâs preeminent elder statesman on world affairs, in particular on the U.S. relationship with China.

Trump declined to comment. Kissingerâs spokesperson was not reachable.

Meeting with Kissinger has become a rite of passage for many ambitious Republicans, especially those who land on the partyâs presidential ticket.Â Sarah Palin had a high-profile meeting with him in 2008 when she becameÂ the GOP vice-presidential nominee, seekingÂ his counsel and association with his credentials.

The face-to-face session comes after weeks of phone conversations between Trump and Kissinger, who was a top adviser to presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. The people close to Trump requested anonymity to discuss his private schedule and his relationship with the 92-year-old former diplomat.

Trumpâs conferring with Kissinger underscores not only how he is building relationships with Republican elders but how he leans toward a more realist view of international affairs, which has long been the bailiwick of Kissingerâs work.

While Trump rarely describes himself as a realist, which is a worldview grounded in national interest, his impulses and comments have often had a hardheaded and non-hawkish tilt, and he has been a critic of extensive U.S. intervention abroad.

âAmerica first will be the overriding theme of my administration,â Trump said last month in a speech at Washingtonâs Mayflower Hotel, where he also called globalism a âfalse song.â

Trump delivered his remarks at an event sponsored by the National Interest, a policy journal affiliated with the Center for the National Interest, which was established by Nixon in 1994.

Last week, during a visit to Washington to meet with party leaders, Trump met with James A. Baker III, another former Republican secretary of state.
