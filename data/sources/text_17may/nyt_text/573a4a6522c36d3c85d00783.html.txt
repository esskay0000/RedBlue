PADUCAH, Ky. â Hillary Clinton fought Monday to fend off Senator Bernie Sanders on the eve of Kentuckyâs Democratic primary, hoping to avoid another show of weakness as she heads into an almost certain general-election fight with Donald J. Trump.

Mrs. Clinton has a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Mr. Sanders. But after losing to him in West Virginia last week and in Indiana on May 3, she is hoping to avoid going winless in Tuesdayâs two contests, in Kentucky and Oregon.

Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, won Kentucky in both 1992 and 1996, and Mrs. Clinton trounced Barack Obama here in the 2008 primary. But this yearâs primary here is hard to predict: Polling has been scarce, and both she and Mr. Sanders have lavished attention on the state.

On Monday, Mrs. Clinton continued a two-day tour, starting her day in the western part of the state with a visit to the Lone Oak Little Castle restaurant in Paducah, where she was joined by Kentuckyâs secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes.

âIâm excited about the primary tomorrow, but we got to turn a lot of people out,â Mrs. Clinton said. âAnd Iâll tell you this: Iâm not going to give up on Kentucky in November.â

Mr. Sanders campaigned in central and western Kentucky over the weekend, visiting Frankfort, Elizabethtown and Paducah and urging voters to flock to the polls. âWhat seems impossible today is not impossible if people come together, stand up and demand that change,â he said in Bowling Green. (He campaigned in Puerto Rico on Monday.)

Oregon, which now votes by mail, requires ballots to be received by Tuesday night, and the stateâs demographics favor Mr. Sanders. Kentucky is more competitive, and it poses another test of how much Mrs. Clinton can appeal to white working-class voters, who have been receptive to Mr. Sandersâs populist message.

In Paducah on Monday, Mrs. Clinton also appealed to voters who have fond memories of her husbandâs administration. âI want to help bring back the kind of economy that worked for everybody in the 1990s,â she said, adding that she had told Mr. Clinton that if she became president, she expected him to work to bolster the economy.

Asked if she would give Mr. Clinton a Cabinet role, Mrs. Clinton shook her head and said no.

Losses in Kentucky and Oregon would not imperil her grip on the Democratic nomination, but Mrs. Clinton is in the awkward position of running two campaigns at once: urging voters to turn out in the primary while also laying out arguments geared toward a face-off with Mr. Trump in November.

Campaigning on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton revived an attack against Mr. Sanders, saying that he voted against the auto industry bailout, though Mr. Sandersâs record is not as clear-cut as Mrs. Clinton suggested.

At the same time, Mrs. Clinton devoted considerable attention to Mr. Trump, criticizing his views on issues like wages and foreign policy.

She also stressed her commitment to help workers in the coal industry, an important issue in Kentucky. She is still trying to recover from a comment she made in March about putting coal miners out of work, which turned off some voters.

âWe canât and we must not walk away from them,â she said on Sunday. âI feel such a sense of obligation.â

At the Lone Oak Little Castle on Monday, where the menu includes staples like biscuits and gravy, Mrs. Clinton saw signs of loyal support for her and her husband, as well as of the resistance she is likely to face in November from some voters.

Residents peered in the windows of the restaurant to try to get a glimpse at the frenzy inside as Mrs. Clinton slowly snaked through the crowd, greeting admirers like Debbie Patterson, 60, who wore a shirt saying, âAnything Bill can do Hill can do better.â

Mrs. Clinton also encountered DiAnna Dooley, 66, a supporter of Mr. Trumpâs who made a miniature Trump sign by scrawling his name on a slip of paper. Before Mrs. Clinton made the rounds, Ms. Dooley described her as âjust a carbon-copy Obama.â

Later, Ms. Dooley told Mrs. Clinton that she would never vote for her. Mrs. Clinton was unruffled: âYou vote for whoever you want,â she replied.
