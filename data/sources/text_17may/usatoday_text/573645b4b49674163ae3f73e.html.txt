Two Republicans, somewhat alike in dignity, in fair Washington, where we lay our scene. A pair of star-crossâd politicians met in real life, who hope to with their meeting bury their partyâs strife.

Donald Trump and Paul Ryan met Thursday. It was dramatic.Â Shakespearan, even. And like two of the Bard's characters of yore, Trump and Ryan pledged their undying devotion (to work together for Republicans this fall).

Here areÂ all the theatrics in todayâsÂ For the Record, the politics newsletter from USA TODAY.

As we previewed yesterday, Trump and Ryan swiped right (though not too far right) and met up to see see if they had any connection.

At stake: The unity of the Republican party, perhaps, should Trump become president and Ryan remain House speaker. The result:Â Itâs complicated.

âWeâre off to a very good start,â said Ryan, who added that he and Trump plan on seeing each other again. But Ryan still hasnât formally endorsed Trump, making this whole thing feel more like an arranged marriage.

Over the course of 45 minutes, Trump and Ryan chatted about free trade, immigration, party unity and probably their hobbies. Reince Priebus, dad of the GOP, chaperoned the whole thing (ugh, so embarrassing) but the Republican national chairman issued his approval:

âThe meeting was great,âÂ Priebus tweeted. Â #ProudDad

Weâve watched the nation move through theÂ five stages of griefÂ since Trump closed in on the GOP, from denial to anger and bargaining to depression. Now, one step remains: acceptance.

Cue Lindsey Graham, the GOP senator who once likened a Trump nomination to being âshot or poisoned.â

Graham spoke with Trump Wednesday, he said, calling the conversation âcordialâ and âpleasant.â And while Graham congratulated Trump on becoming the face of the GOP, Graham still says he wonât vote for him.

Also not endorsing Trump:Â George H.W. Bush. But Bushâs former V.P.? Sure, why not.

Dan Quayle praised Trump on theÂ TodayÂ showÂ Thursday, claiming he is more qualified to be presidentÂ than Hillary ClintonÂ because votersâ main qualificationÂ is that a candidate not be qualified to be president. Makes sense, actually.

With only a narrow path to the nomination (by his words, not ours), Bernie Sanders is still hustling in early states andÂ picking upÂ someÂ primary wins. His real goal: to beef up his delegate count, giving him more sway to shape his partyâs platform at the Democratic convention this summer.

He looks now to the June 7 primary in New Jersey, a state whose wacky ballot system requiresÂ Sanders to get a 28-year-old guy named Alex to run for sheriff. Alex doesnât want to be a sheriff. Alex doesnât think heâll be a sheriff. But such is this convoluted process we call democracy.



Memo to Ted Cruz: You may be out of the 2016 race. You may be back to running for Senate. But youâll never be free from the scorn of John Boehner. Heâs retired, has plenty of free time, and seemsÂ committed to publicly insulting you at every opportunityÂ for the rest of his days.
