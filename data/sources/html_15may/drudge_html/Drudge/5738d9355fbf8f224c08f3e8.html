They want the foreigners to think ­everything is OK.”<\/p><p>Beyonce, 34, previewed last month’s launch at Topshop’s flagship Oxford Street store in London with a sizzling video on YouTube. <\/p><p>She said: “My goal with Ivy Park is to push the boundaries of ­athletic wear and to support and inspire women who understand that beauty is more than your physical appearance. <\/p><p>“True beauty is in the health of our minds, hearts and bodies. <\/p><p>“I know that when I feel physically strong, I am mentally strong and I wanted to create a brand that made other women feel the same way.”<\/p><p>Beyonce and rapper hubby Jay Z are worth a combined £760million. <\/p><p>She named the 228-piece Ivy Park range after their four-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. <\/p><p>In 2013 Beyonce headlined the Chime for Change gig at Twickenham to raise cash for struggling women and girls around the world. <\/p><p>The star was joined by Jay Z during her 45-minute set for the gig, which raised £2.8million. <\/p><p>Sir Philip, 64, took more than £400million out of BHS before ­selling it for £1 last year.

She has to work Saturdays and overtime in the week. <\/p><p>The monotonous work involves stitching clothes alongside hundreds of other women. <\/p><p>Speaking at her cramped 100-room boarding house near the factory in Katunayake, close to Colombo airport, she said: “All we do is work, sleep, work, sleep.”<\/p><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865362\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p>She shares a basic 10ft by 10ft room with her 19-year-old sister for which they each pay 4,000 rupees a month, or £18.86. <\/p><p>The farmer’s daughter, from a remote village 200 miles away, said: “We don’t have our own kitchen or shower, it’s just a small bedroom. We have to share the shower block with the men so there isn’t much privacy. It is shocking and many of the women are very scared. <\/p><p>“We don’t have much spare money and what we do have we send back to our family.”<\/p><p>Like thousands of other women working in garment factories in Sri Lanka, the sisters were forced to move to find work. <\/p><p>The older sister added: “We had to come and work here because our father could not afford to feed us and there are no jobs there. <\/p><p>“We have no choice. I have worked here for three years now and it was very difficult at the beginning but I am used to it now. <\/p><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865363\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p>“And it’s better now that my ­sister is here with me.” Her sister said: “I miss home. <\/p><p>“The work is hard — it’s just the same, same, same every day. <\/p><p>“We don’t get to go home much because we work all the time. They say if you work you can go up, up, up, but that’s just office workers. For us it stays the same always.”<\/p><p>Their three-storey boarding house has a strict 10.30pm curfew after which the gates are locked, mainly for their own safety. <\/p><p>The communal shower block was only installed last month and the landlord hiked the rent by 500 rupees a month to pay for it. <\/p><p>They previously washed in a communal well. The workers are not entitled to sick pay and get no paid holiday in their first year. <\/p><p>Another machinist we spoke to, who has worked for the company for 11 years, said there was little opportunity to escape poverty. <\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865364\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p>The 40-year-old, who lives in a compound made up of ten basic rooms built from breeze blocks with corrugated iron roofs, said her basic wages were 21,000 rupees per month, or £99. <\/p><p>She said: “I have worked here many years and my money is a bit more now. I have to work many hours overtime to pay for everything and there is no money left afterwards.”<\/p><p>MAS Holdings is owned by Sri Lankan tycoon Mahesh Amalean, 61, and his two brothers. <\/p><p>It employs 74,000 workers, 70 per cent of them women, in 48 factories in 15 countries across Asia. <\/p><p>The company says on its website that it works to promote “gender equality and women’s empowerment” and helps workers “to achieve a well-rounded and holistic life-experience”. <\/p><p>MAS is not breaking any laws and even the poorest workers are paid more than the legal minimum wage of 13,500 rupees a month. <\/p><p>But campaigners say a living wage is nearer 43,000 rupees. <\/p><p>Jakub Sobik, from the charity Anti-Slavery International, said: “This is a form of sweat shop slavery. <\/p><p>“There are a number of elements here that tick the boxes in terms of slavery, the low pay, restriction of women’s movement at night and locking them in. <\/p><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865365\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p>“Companies like Topshop have a duty to find out if these things are happening, and it has long been shown that ethical inspections by these companies are failing. They should be replaced by independent inspections.”<\/p><p>The Arcadia group, which owns Topshop, claims it enforces a “code of conduct” on suppliers. <\/p><p>It states: “When customers buy our goods they have to be sure they have been made under acceptable conditions. That means without exploiting the people who make them.”<\/p><p>The group adds that all ­suppliers must provide “decent working conditions”. <\/p><p>But Owen Espley, sweat shops campaigner for anti-poverty charity War on Want, said: “The superyachts and luxurious lifestyles enjoyed by the likes of Philip Green are a far cry from the grim reality facing garment workers in Sri Lanka. <\/p><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865366\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865367\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p>“Unless the fashion industry is transformed, women will continue to be exploited to ­produce clothes for the UK high street. <\/p><p>“As long as brands remain unaccountable for conditions in their suppliers’ factories, ­garment workers and their ­families will suffer.”<\/p><p>A Topshop spokeswoman said: “Ivy Park has a rigorous ethical trading programme. <\/p><p>“We expect our suppliers to meet our code of conduct and we support them in achieving these requirements.”<\/p><p>A statement by Ivy Park said: \"Ivy Park has a rigorous ethical trading programme.<\/p><p>\"We are proud of our sustained efforts in terms of factory inspections and audits, and our teams worldwide work very closely with our suppliers and their factories to ensure compliance. <\/p><p>\"We expect our suppliers to meet our code of conduct and we support them in achieving these requirements.\"<\/p><p><i><b>-AROUND<\/b> 150 protesters blocked Oxford Street and let off smoke bombs during a Topshop protest yesterday. <\/i><\/p><p>The demonstration was organised by living wage campaigners who claim two store cleaners were victimised and bullied for joining the United Voices of the World union. <\/p><h2 align=\"center\">What pay buys <\/h2><p><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"2865368\" type=\"image\"/><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p>WHAT 902 rupees or £4.30 a day goes on... <\/p><p>McDonald’s meal: 650rupees (£3.07). <\/p><p>Pint of beer: 200rupees (94p). <\/p><p>Litre of milk: 150rupees (71p). <\/p><p>Levi jeans: 3,900 rupees (£18.41). <\/p><p>Trainers: 8,000 rupees (£37.74). <\/p><p>1-bed flat rent monthly: 30,000 rupees (£141.51). <\/p><p><br><\/br><\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"6860580\" type=\"manualArticleList\"/> <\/p>","articleMainMedia":{"imageMainPosition":0,"image":{"altText":"Main Image","caption":"The star . . .
