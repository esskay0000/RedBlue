Over the weekend, The Washington Post reported that a group of anti-Trump Republicans led by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and conservative commentator William Kristol had begun recruiting candidates to make an independent run for the White House.

According to the paper, Romney has made personal overtures to Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a prominent anti-Trump Republican, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Inquries have also been made to businessman and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.Priebus Fox_0007_L" width="154" height="115" />

Temer went to the police and last week the hacker was arrested, before any of the photos leaked out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Perhaps his biggest headache, though, will be trying to rein in his high-maintenance wife while, as the country's new 'austere' president, he attempts to show the country he is reining in excessive spending.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Taking office at the swearing-in ceremony last week, Temer said: 'First of all, we need to balance our public spending.

Nearly 4,000 other possible cases are still being investigated.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But the amount of money put aside to fight the Zika crisis is 16 times less than what has been spent on hosting the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, which start on August 5.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The Olympics, which have so far cost over £7billion, and was supposed to be a 'coming out party' for once-booming Brazil, is another massive headache.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">With a surge in violent crime in Rio, and worries over the Zika epidemic, terrorism and protests amid the country's political upheaval, only half of the 7.5million tickets have been sold.

Jorah and Daario engage in a difficult task. Jamie and Cersei try to improve their situation.\nSeven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond. \n" />

Cmdr. Eric Rasch was the executive officer of the squadron when they 'misnavigated' into the Islamic republic's territory last January.
The nine men and a woman were detained on Farsi Island - a top secret Iranian government facility - for 16 hours before they were released.
The diplomatic debacle that ensued had almost scuttled the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal at the 11th hour.
