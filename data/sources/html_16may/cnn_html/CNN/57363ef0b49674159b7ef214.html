I mean, media is, as usual, focused on the wrong things and advocating responsibility for the general filtration of toxicity.  You have enormous amounts of money flowing into crazy people who are channeling populace of years past.

I don't necessarily believe that a full court press on his untruthinness would necessarily change it.  I mean, he's not -- he was voted for, but I do think he is, generally, the conclusion to years of -- he makes sense if you view it through the prism of talk radio.  I like to drive, and so I listen to talk radio and it is 24/7 of 'your country is being taken away from you.'

This is you are run by a tyrant; he is going to take away your rights.  We are falling.  There are rapists and murders at the border coming to kill you.  If that's what you've been fed and that's what you're buying into, Donald Trump makes more sense than anybody else out there because he's going, "Great, let's build -- the Visigoths are out the gate.  Let's build a f---ing wall and not let it..." It makes total sense.

He tends to sue for things like that.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yeah, I mean, I'm just -- I don't know that a man-baby can be president.  He's -- character is destiny and he is the most thin-skinned individual -- and look, you've been around politicians, you know they're thin-skinned.  You know President Obama, for all his qualities that you love, gets angry and I've borne the...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Irritated, I would say.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> STEWART:   ...brunt of that, at times.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yes.  I've heard.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yes.  But, I don't know that he has -- and they keep saying, which I think is the most wonderful thing, "Don't worry, when he becomes president, he's going to be totally mature."  And...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Well, he says, he said, "Being presidential is easy, and he'll do it at the appropriate time."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right, but what does that say about your constituency if what you're saying to them is, "Look, the only way that I can win this part of the race is by being an unrepentant, narcissistic asshole, because that's what my voters like.  But once I have to appeal everybody, I'll be cool."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.  But, the fact is that you look at all these exit polls from primary after primary, and the big number that he commands is he tells it like it is.  He says stuff other politicians aren't willing to say, and, you know, you spoke earlier about people who are frightened, you know, because of these changes in the economy that have left them without the kind of future that they thought they would have, and they're eating that up.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right, but that, again, and this gets to the point of...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Authenticity is what they say.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   This gets to the point, though, of the press versus the campaign, and what we see in the press is they're covering the campaign, but they're not covering voracity or, you know, so the exit polls say this is what people think, then someone in the press has to come out and go, "Wow, people must be assholes because that's not OK to think, you know.  It's no OK to have nostalgia for the madmen society and think that that ignorance is virtue."  And they have twisted this around so that his ignorant pronouncements are somehow a sign of great character.  It's like where I grew up, when people go like, 'Hey look, no disrespect, I'm not saying your mother's a whore, I'm saying..." and you're like, "I think that's what you're saying." </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  The difference is he would just say, "Your mother's a whore."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.  But, when he says, you know, "People are so nerv..." -- See, here's what so amazing about this.  So, the whole idea of political correctness is everybody's so sensitive, just get over it.  you know, why should African Americans be so sensitive about police shootings?  Why do they have to be so sensitive about years of systemic racism creating economic disparity?  Come on.  I'm not a slave owner.  Donald Trump couldn't handle us making a joke about him.  Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter, did a joke about Donald Trump's hands 25 years ago.  He's still not f---ing over it.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  And his hands weren't any bigger.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   So Muslims...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Not true, by the way.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   He actually did a spiel...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Finger extensions.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   ...Trump International, and if you see them now, they say, "Trump," in gold letters.  (Inaudible).  But the idea being that Muslims, hey man, all he's saying is they're evil and shouldn't be allowed in this country.  He's just telling it like it is, but God forbid you say, "Happy Holidays" in December.  It's f---ing war.  So who is it who's exactly sensitive here?   We're only talking about what are the trigger points and the trigger points, to me, seem to be, on one side, grounded in a certain reality of life that only those with no experience or empathy towards what those individuals are going through are having and the other seems to be a clinging to a societal paradigm that just doesn't exist anymore and probably never did.  When was America great?  What is this time that he speaks of, '81 to '82?  Like what are we talking about, and who took your country away from you?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Whose country, you know, whose is it?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Take up...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Well those...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWARET:  ...take up the argument with the founders, take it up with the age of reason.  That's the, you know, "All men are created equal," that's f---ed the whole thing up. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.  The, you know the thing that they -- I think the people who are rallying to him would say -- I mean, some of it is just, I think, grounded in pure racism, and nativism, and all of that, but there also is the fact that the economy; you mentioned globalism, technology...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Mm-hmm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...has made a lot of jobs obsolete that...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...you didn't need a college education.

But, you have a situation in government that makes that very difficult, if government is.  The fallacy of this whole thing, and maybe it's a leftover for the Marshall Plan and everything else, and the nostalgia for the World War II era, is that America can actually control things in a matter that is tidy.  This idea, somehow, that we can control -- we live in a post-colonial world.  We no longer have a western frontier.  Like, that's just reality.  And, globalization is not a question of -- American policy cannot -- that box has been opened and the problem with globalization is not that America hasn't handle it, it's that corporate America would prefer -- money travels, people don't.  so, if they can send money to places where they can hire 100 people that'll work twelve hours a day for two dollars, versus ten people that only work eight hours a day for $15 an hour, what are they going to do?  So, this has nothing to do with...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  That's kind of the argument Trump's been making.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Here -- but here's the real political incorrectness.  If they really want to be truthful, the problems in this country are not because of Mexicans and Muslims, and if they want to, in any way, confront what's really going on, the problems in this country is you have one party in America whose sole purpose is to freeze the government and to not fix any of the problems that are associated with it.  They have a great game going, which is:  government sucks and can't get the job done, and then they can sit as an impediment to that government and point to their destruction as evidence of their thesis.  It's a great tautology and it's -- for what everyone is saying about the democrats, maybe they're feckless, maybe they focus too much on identify politics, or they're not fiscally responsible.  At least they're f---ing trying. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah, well, I'm not going to debate you on that. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   You know what?  You're not the same without the mustache.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  I know, but thank God you took up the facial hair so we can still carry the torch out there. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I appreciate that.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Well, talk -- I want to talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton, but...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Who?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...before we do -- before we do, you're obviously -- you haven't lost your edge, you haven't lost your passion.

There's only two cities that I know of that are that arrogant and that's D.C. and Los Angeles, where they truly believe -- and we saw it again with Larry Wilmore. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  At the White House Correspondents'...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   At the White House Correspondents' Dinner.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  I want to ask you about your reaction.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Larry Wilmore did the White House Correspondents' Dinner and everybody went nuts, "My God, he's done."

I don't think he gives a sh--.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   You know, and when you watch the post-show analysis, it was all based on whether or not he had helped himself; how some of the room had read it, and not, in any way...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  A little narcissistic there.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART: But not only narcissistic, but in no way an examination of the foundation of what he was saying, which is:  You are an incredibly corrupt and blinded, symbiotic terrarium. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah, I don't understand why that message wasn't well received.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Here's the thing, not well received, not received.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yes.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Not noticed.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Now that's -- yes. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   They did not notice it.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   What they noticed was, "He didn't get that many laughs.  He really bombed."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.  Well that's the weird thing about the White House Correspondents' Dinner...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...because there is this, sort of, strange symbiosis between Hollywood and Washington and they're similar communities...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Mm-hmm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...and so the actors come to Washington and love to mix with the politicians; the politicians love to mix with the actors, and you know there is a narcissism about those two communities that is very much the same.  You did the dinner once, right...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...in '97?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Mm-hmm.  I did it right after Imus, and Imus famously made a joke, I guess, about Clinton's proclivities, and again they said...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  For diplomacy, for...?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yes.  For reading mostly.  I have to watch, obviously we're in a church, there's only so far I can go.  Or, actually, you know what?  I'm out of his jurisdiction, so I can pretty much say whatever I want.  He'd be ready to strike me down with lightening, and be like, "Eh, it's not his house anyway."  I think that the problem is the system is incentivized in all the wrong directions.  And, right now, the system is incentivized in the way that a crack dealer is incentivized, which is it can do tremendous damage, but as long as people are buying crack, everything's good on his block, and I really, I truly believe it's that corrosive and corrupt.  When you have the presidents of networks saying, "Trump is good for business."  When you have the lead anchor of FOX News having to go to Trump's hotel to make him stop being mean to her, and now he says she's terrific because they've had a dayton (ph), that's f---ed.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   You know, I don't know how you describe -- you know, there are heads of networks who have said, "Donald Trump is great for business."  Well, why would you kill the thing that's great for business?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Well, I asked you that at the beginning and you...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Why would you even say what it was?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  I asked you at the beginning and you were sort of dismissive about what the role of the media has been.  But, what you're suggesting is that there is an -- they have a pecuniary interest the Trump story.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Correct.  Right?  I think what I was responding to, about the role of the media is, can they solve it on their own?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Mm-hmm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   But look, television journalism was ahead of the game at the Nixon-Kennedy debate, you know.  That's when the television medium...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  That was a while ago.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   ...came into -- Right.  I was there, you were there.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.  We were pages.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  ...came into effect.  Basically, Kennedy understood it a little bit, rudimentary he thought, I should probably wear makeup and Nixon was like, "I look right."  You know, so he went out there and, you know, everybody thought he had hepatitis and that was the end of his career.  Since then, an entire industry has risen up as to how to manipulate and skew that medium to the advantage of the politicians and the powerful, and the industry, rather than, in some ways, creating a counterweight to that, have been subsumed by it, and so now it's a symbiosis.  The media is no longer predator and prey, which I think should be the relationship, but a Remora that's just attached underneath, hoping for crumbs that fall off the shark.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Thought they do -- I mean, I watched Trump with George Stephanopoulos yesterday...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Mm-hmm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...who tried to probe -- I don't know if you saw this show, but he was probing him on his various proposals and Trump said, you know he said, "You know your tax plan would be a windfall for the wealthy" and Trump said, "Well, it is now, but once we negotiate, it won't be anymore." </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Mm-hmm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  And just basically shedding all of his...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...positions, so.  But he's being challenged.  He's just -- he's just.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   No.  But it's -- you're talking about singular, anecdotal moments.  You're talking about floating logs in a torrent.  You know, the relentless of the cycle requires an equal counterweight.  It can't -- a counterweight does not mean that occasionally, you know, you push back to a small extent as the waters rush by you everywhere else.  That's, I think, where FOX has an advantage, is that they understood that, to take over the cycles, you need to be relentless; you need to be perpetuating your point of view and your propaganda in the same way that people consume it, which is constantly, and self-reinforcingly, and over and over and over again. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Which seems to be (inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Unless you have someone pushing back with that same force, you're not going to have any balance.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Well, the interesting thing about this election though is it's not much different.  Trump has, basically, embraced that tactic.  I mean, he is relentless, he is ubiquitous, he is out there all the time.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   He's just learned how to -- he's just doing judo against them.  What works for a 24-hour network -- what is it incentivized for?  It is incentivized for -- here's what you would want it to be incentivized for:  clarity.  It is incentivized for what?  Conflict.  The voices that are amplified are the ones that are the most conflict-oriented, the most extreme; those are the guys that get the airtime.  So, if they're incentivized for conflict, Trump is not playing this like that.  Everybody keeps talking about, "He's amazing."  He's not -- this is the first season of survivor.  This is reality show 101.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Right, right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I'm going to be an enormous dick at the beginning of the show to get all of this attention and then, once I make it to final council, then I'm going to reveal -- he's -- what's the guy's name?  Jonny Fairplay.  He's Jonny Fairplay.  He's the guy who said, "Oh, my grandmother died, and don't vote me out."  And then, finally, when he got to the final tribal council, that's what he's playing.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Talk to be about Hillary Clinton as an opponent to him, and what...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I've never run against her, so I don't...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...what would you be saying about her if you were doing your show right now?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   What I think about Hillary Clinton is, you know, I imagine to be a very bright woman without the courage of her convictions because I'm not even sure what they are.  So, I would suggest that, when I watch her campaign -- when I watch her campaign, it reminds me of -- and again, I'm throwing out references that mean absolutely nothing to anybody, so I will continue to do that -- she reminds me of Magic Johnson's talk show, and I won't say anything else.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  You had that thought too, huh?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   If you ever watch Magic Johnson's tele--  Magic Johnson was a charming individual, but he wasn't a talk show host, and when you watched his show you could almost see Arsenio's advice to him, in real time rendering, so he would sit and he would go, "Uh, my first guest tonight -- Oh, Arsenio said, enthusiasm is something that's sell is -- "my first guess tonight is Cher, everybody."  But he never seemed authentic and real to his personality.  It seemed like he was wearing an outfit designed by someone else for someone else to be someone else, and that is not to say that she is not preferable to Donald Trump, because at this point, I would vote for Mr. T over Donald Trump.  But, I think she will be in big trouble if she can't find a way, and maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe a real person doesn't exist underneath there.  I don't know.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  You worked -- you dabbled on the government side when you were advocating for the Zadroga Act for 9/11 survivors.

Kirsten Gillibrand is terrific.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  So, Hillary was out of the Senate by then.

It's -- look, there are politicians who are either rendering their inauthenticity in real enough time to appear authentic, and then there are politicians who render their inauthenticity through -- it's like when your computer -- you want to play -- if you have a MAC and you want to play a Microsoft game on it...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yes, yes.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   ...and there's that weird lag.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yes.

The...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   By the way, as far as uplifting messages, I have never in my life experienced what I experienced in my one day of lobbying down in Washington, D.C.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah, I want to ask you about...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   And let me just say, like for however I painted it on the show, it's so much worse than you could possibly imagine.  It is a cesspool.  There are some good people trying to survive within the lava, but it's a f---ing horror show.  No disrespect.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  No.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   There is...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Just the fact that you're at the Institute of Politics where we're trying to encourage young people to get into the public arena.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Can I say this?  Get into it and don't get it on you.  I've never -- I was down there with firefighters who had spent a year on the smoldering remains of the World Trade Center.  The guy that I was with, Ray Pfeifer, had a titanium rod in his leg that was breaking because of the metastasized cancer that was roiling through it that he got from being on the pile.  We had the scientific evidence with us.  You cannot imagine the disrespect, the lack of compassion, that was exhibited towards this man and this cause by individuals in higher office.  It was -- I will never recover from it. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  So, here's my -- here's my theory, because I can't sit in front of a thousand young people and not say this; you know, you have to -- if you turn away, and you walk away from this and you just seed -- seed all of that to the people you're talking about, you're going to get what you get and it seems to me that there's some obligation to go in there and try and change it.  You say go in there and don't get it on you...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yes.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...but, we need that.  We need that.   We need that.  No, but this is the most public spirited...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   When I say, "Don't get it on you" I don't mean, don't engage.  I mean, take appropriate precautions, wear a HAZMAT suit.  Bring your ideals.  Whenever I speak to -- and we used to do this thing every year where we'd bring the press secretaries for all the Senate and all the House people that wanted to come in and they would say to me, "So, what can my candidate to have a successful appearance on your show?"  And I would say, "He could, or she could, say what she thinks about the issues concerning America." </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  And he says, "Is there any other way to do it?"</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  But they would say, "But what should I tell them?  What works best?"  "When people say what they believe."  "What's that?"   And honestly, like, I know you think that I'm being hyperbolic.  I recognize that you don't understand this.  I am not -- they are as unaware of their own machinations as you could possibly imagine.  It's -- and I'm not even saying its malevolence.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  It's the way the game is played.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I assume that it's survival.  That's a good (inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  But you must've met people over the course of -- from '99 to last year, doing this show...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Mm-hmm.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...you must have run across people who were disarming and...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Sure, no, I must've.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Do you want a few seconds to think about that?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yeah, hold on.  There are people that were -- what I would get there is the same thing I would get in the news industry, which is people would pull you aside, and they would say, "Yeah man, it sucks.  It's so -- you're absolutely right, it's terrible down here."  And you would just go, "Hmm."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  But, you know, again, I don't want to sit here as this, sort of, defender of a system that is badly broken.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  But there are people who do make a difference.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   (Inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  You mentioned Kirsten Gillibrand; there are others who...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Sure.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...actually go there and try (inaudible)...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   The thing I always -- the amount of energy that you have to expend -- I'll just go along with the 9/11 building.  This is as no-brainer as you can possibly get.  This is, a hoard of zombies would stop their brain-eating rampage to go, "Yeah, those guys should get some healthcare.  That makes sense."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.  So run out a find a hoard of zombies?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   So, these guys, for nine years, had to travel with cancer, with mesothelioma, with low lung function, with heart failure, nine years of incessant lobbying to move this body and it only, through their lobbying efforts, and some measure of public shaming, they relented in the most condescending of ways, to finally give into it.  If it takes that effort to do something that easy, it is a system that must be -- it is self-perpetuating in a way that is dangerous...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   ...at this point.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  You know, but I saw, you know, I saw, and you were there, doing your thing, I saw people cast votes for the Affordable Care Act, who lost their positions and people who voted for Cap and Trade to try and do something about climate change...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Sure.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...who lost their positions.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  And we should -- and there are some who didn't, but we should, at least, acknowledge that there are those people who are willing to do that.  I always say, Profiles in Courage, was a thin volume for a reason. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  OK, it's not the norm.  But, it's something that we should...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I guess my point is, is why, in God's name, should that be courage?  In what world is taking a political stand and trying to affect legislation that should be -- and by the way, what's incumbent on those who believe government can make a difference in people's lives is to try and make it more efficient and I think that's where the democrats fail in an enormous way, is that in their world, if you believe that government can make a difference in people's lives, well then make the bureaucracy work more efficiently, make the regulations that are strangling, you know, small businesses; don't just open the FED window at zero percent to corporations.  Force them, at some level, to, at least, give a percentage of that to small business loans.  I mean -- and I understand that they are trying.  And, you and your boss and I had a big argument about this, but the VA.  If you can do an Executive Order to kill an American citizen from above with a missile, how can you not do an Executive Order to re-evaluate the DOD and the VA systems so that you don't spend a billion dollars trying to get two computer programs to talk to each other when probably three of these idiots could do it for $500?  It doesn't wash.  And at some level, and I'll lay the blame then with the democrats.  The door is open to an asshole, like Donald Trump, because the democrats haven't done enough to show to people that government, that can be effective for people, can be efficient for people, and if you can't do that, then you've lost the right to make that change and someone's going to come in and demagogue you...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   ...and that's what happens.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  I don't know, Jon, that the people who are following Trump are following him because of efficiency.  I think there are other elements.  There are other elements, without question.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   And, I don't disagree with you. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  I've always said this, that we be committed to ends and not means, and if the means don't work, then change them, you know.  I think that challenging government is something that democrats should do.  But, on the other hand...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Let me ask you a question.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...on the other hand, let me...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Is government too big to manage?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  That's a very good question and what I think happens is we've got a country of 330,000,000 so government's going to be large.  What I think happens is bureaucracy builds on bureaucracy and it gets incrusted on top of itself...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...and we -- especially in an age of technology, there is an opportunity to do things better and more creatively and I think that government should (inaudible).

What are you gonna do?"  And, you're like, "I don't know."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  And here's the thing Jon, government...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...the system we have, and you wrote the definitive on the U.S. Constitution, so I know you know this...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Right.  </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...the government we have is hard to move.

There are these projects going on within government, but it's very hard to turn it around.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  So...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   But, all I'm saying is, if people can see your re-election effort be incredible agile and, I mean, I honestly, I'm still getting emails from Re-Elect barack Obama, like sometimes through, like the television.

Thank you for that.  That was the appropriate amount of applause for New Jersey.  Wait.  You said, "When you were growing up in New Jersey" and literally I just heard this... like in the way you would if, at the Masters, somebody sank a put.  All right, go ahead.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  But, you could not have imagined that you would be opining and you'd have the world hanging on your words on politics, on the social scene.  I mean, this wasn't -- you couldn't -- this was not your life goal.  This is important because I think some kids are taught to believe that they need to have a life plan.  You didn't have a life plan to become what you are now.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I did. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Well, yeah, kind of a circuitous route to get there.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I was raised in a laboratory, a comedic laboratory.

I mean, you know, the one thing I also want to make clear to people is, when you're not on television, you're still alive, and you're still engaged in the world, and I feel maybe more engaged with the world in a real way now than I ever did sitting on television interviewing politicians and convincing them, you know, I...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Do you have any creative projects planned between now and November that have to do with the election, whether it's on the internet...?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I mean, you know, we're working on technology and animation to try to do, sort of, interesting, little, small bits, and if we can figure out...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  (Inaudible) go viral.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   I don't -- again, like, do what you think is good, and if you get 50 likes, great; if you get 500 likes.

The reason why I was talking about bureaucracy is so my wife, who is so much nicer than me; you'd love her, she is -- we're starting this sanctuary for farm animals, so we had to go before a local Monmouth County Agriculture Board.  The epitome of real America civic engagement, civic society.  The work that these individuals -- they were all farmers; the board is ten farmers -- the work that they put into preserving and keeping the farm life and what they do, there way of life was inspiring.

I wish I had a better answer.  I just don't -- I don't know.  You know, we're working on it.

I don't -- in other words, you know, let me put it this way, the October surprise in this election is not a two-minute cartoon that I'm going to release.  Like, the powers that be are working very diligently.  Television has never been more right with beautiful satire.  There are people from John Oliver to Sam B., to Steven Colbert to Seth Meyers, to Trevor, to Larry, to -- I am so impressed and amazed at the level of insight and wit that is displayed on television every day.

I was like, "Hey, what?"</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  (Inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I don't think the mic is...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">COMMENTATOR:  Yeah, thank you so much.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Oh, I see, there we go.  You're coming next.  I'm sorry.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Thank you for being here.  Thinking about this election cycle and the rise of Trump or Sarah Palin's condemnation of Paul Ryan, or whatever it is...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:   Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...are there limits to comedy, the effect that it can have, and are there certain topics that are off limits to political satire?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  To the first -- no topic is off limits, unless you've got one that you'd like to toss out there because no topics are off limits to life.  And, I'm still waiting for someone to ask that question to a politician instead of a comic, because all I ever hear is people always say, "Where's the line?"  And they always ask comedians, "Where's the line?"  Very rarely do they say to Presidents and Senators, "Where's the line?  Which bomb would be the line?"  So, it's always interesting to me that people think comedians, somehow, are the ones that go against -- you know, push human nature too far.  But, the actions of our government, or somehow we all just kind of accept it.  And I would say this, as far as the efficacy of satire, I am of the school of Peter Cook, who was a great comedian.  Dudley Moore and Peter Cook were a great team and he was a British comedian, and he was asked once, "What is the greatest satire, in your mind?  Who had the greatest satire?"  And Peter Cook, as normal comedians would, when ask that question, would go, "I don't know" and so the interviewer said, "Well, I believe it was the follies of Berlin; Munich in Berlin in 1938, the rise of the Nazis."  And Peter Cook said, "Yeah, they really showed Hitler" and that's how I feel about satire.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Hi.  Thank you so much for coming.  My name is Baxter Stein, I'm a second year here in the college, and my question is about policy and comedy.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  And so, one of your intellectual successors, John Oliver, does a lot of work every week, you know, advocating for policy change.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  And so I just want to hear more about your philosophy and what (inaudible) areas of policy are where you think comedy can have a big impact?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  You know, here's the only thing I would say, shame can be a final gust of wind.  Comedy can't have an impact on policy.  People can have an impact on policy.  Grassroots lobbying, foundational lobbying, have an influence.  In terms of 9/11 and Zadroga, as an example, nine years they worked, tirelessly, down there, at the right moment -- it's sort of -- you know what it reminds me of?  Back to the Future.  He built the car, he spent his whole life building that car, and all one guy had to do was just make the clock hand go to that one thing.  That's comedy.  You're just -- when the lightening -- if there's one moment that could help the guy that has made his life's work something this profound, if you can somehow focus some energy on that, in that moment, at just the right time, it can be catalyzing, but it, in no way, can be mistaken for activism.   Comedy and satire are an expression.  They are an artistic idea.  They are not activism.  It is not anything other than a painting, a song, a joke.  None of those can change anything.  They can, occasionally, focus a conversation at a crucial moment and help the good work of all the individuals that have put in that time, and I never forget that.  Nothing that we ever did meant anything compared to the people on the ground in grassroots who work tirelessly in anonymity against all odds to do what's right, and have to do that facing headwinds that shouldn't be there in the first place, that are artificial. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Jon, when you went to the Daily Show...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...it was a much different show that you inherited then.  It was more celebrity-oriented show.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Sure.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Did you make a decision right from the beginning that we're going to do political satire and we're going to use the platform where we can be that final ingredient or...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  No.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD: ...did this all evolve over time?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  No.  None of it is explicit and conscious.  What I made a decision about on the Daily Show, when I took it is, I'm not interested in this, I'm interested in this, and if I'm going to spend every day here, 12 hours a day, I want to work on something I'm interested in, and I'm not interested in that.  But at no moment was there ever the explicit, we are going to turn this ship to focus here to enact change there.  It was, "That seems boring; that seems interesting.  Let's do that."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">HEBNER:  HI.  I'm Brock Hebner (ph), I'm a fourth year student here. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Brock, I know who you are.  Everybody knows 'The Hebner.'  Yeah, baby.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:   You knocked the question right out of him.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">HEBNER:  There has been so much talent that has come out of the Daily Show with your correspondence.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">HEBNER:  And I'm wondering what about the Daily Show environment, in general, or your leadership, in particular, do you think led to the growth and development of such talented actors and talk show hosts?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Brock, when you are a facilitator of men, if I may -- I mean, some of it, honestly, is happenstance.  We were fortunate to be able to identify really talented people and have the pleasure and honor of having them come and work with us and hopefully the environment was stimulating enough for them and collaborative enough for them that they were able to express themselves to their best ability, and I think that's -- you know, my feeling about those environments is always, simply, have a clarity of vision, but a flexibility of process.  So, the idea being, know your intention.  It's the one -- the only thing that you can ever control is intention.  You can't control people's perception of it, you can't control what they make of it, but you can control through your own sense of moral foundation, or barometer, or whatever it is that makes you tick, what your intention is, and then you try and execute that intention to its best Avatar, to its best self, and that's what we would try and do in the show, and we were fortunate to have access to the kind of talent that we did.  So, I don't know that there was anything inherent in the atmosphere as much as in the same way that I felt like talking about issues in politics would make it more interesting, we were able to find performers that also felt that way, and together that created, I think, a certain energy through part of that process.  Cameraman has a question?  (Inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Hi.  I just wanted to back to -- earlier you were talking about the media and how they...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yes.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  ...kind of twisted incentives.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  And I was wondering how we could really go about changing those incentives, to focus on clarity over a conflict, like you said, kind of stray away from the FOX business model.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Well, it's not -- the one thing I would say is it's not just the FOX business model.  I think it's the business model.  FOX has found a way to work their ideology into the business model, which I think is, you know, having your cake and eating it too.  CNN doesn't have an ideology, other than, you know, narrating the news as it happens outside, without knowing why.  MSNBC would like to have the clarity of their ideology mesh with making money, but so far, that hasn't just worked out.  But, I think, again, news isn't just another -- as in the same way that I view healthcare; it's just not another commodity that is placed on your cable box, and I think the concerted effort has to be is to remove it from that system, to not necessarily to try and create a 24-hour news network that can be powerful counterweight, a FOX news of voracity, where it's not so reliant on the daily (inaudible) of ratings and such, but is still good television and is still interesting, and I think it can be done.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELFORD:  When you and I were kids, there were three major networks.  Everybody watched, sort of, the same news and so on.  Now, the media environment is completely vulcanized and...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  ...and people tend to seek out the media that affirm their views rather than necessarily inform their views.  Is that unhealthy?  I mean, how do you get people to listen to each other?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Well, I thank people, in general -- yeah, I mean, I don't know of people that don't live that way normally.  And, you know, I don't think that's a common, like, phenomenon that people tend to congregate with like-minded people.  I don't know if you -- you ate lunch in high school, right?  Like, it's not like in high school you sought out, "Today, I'm going to sit with the stoner kids..."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  No.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  ...and find out what they think about Pink Floyd."  Like people tend to go with people that they're like-minded.  What I would say about media today is that maybe you're in a bubble, but generally little bits of other people's bubbles find their way into yours, and that's, as far as I'm concerned, that's good.  But you need a bubble-making machine.  You need a machine that makes good bubbles and is constantly putting them out there and popping other people's sh--ty bubbles.  So -- but I would suggest that while there is this, sort of, epistemic closure that you talk about, because of the volume of material being generated, and the tenacity of the material being generated, there's a lot of crosspollination, and so, people are much more aware of -- that's part of what globalization is about and that's part of what fuels the anger of globalization is there's a lot of people in a lot of places who go, who just found out, "Oh, we're getting f---ed.  We didn't even know that. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">And now we do."  So, again, every technology has the ability to elevate and the ability to denigrate, and I'm saying that when it comes to news, and again, this is an exercise of editorial authority.  This is subjective.   There is no objectivity here.  It is subjective, you know, but the internet has the ability to elevate discussion; it also has the ability to just, look, I read the comments sections just like everybody else.  Like, I just found out just because I have a gray beard that I have cancer or AIDS.  Like, that's the comment section.  What happened to Jon Stewart?  He has cancer or AIDS?  He had CAIDS, Cancer-AIDS." </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Like, I don't know.  Like, that's just what it is.  That being said, that's not unusual.  Like, what is the biggest thing on the internet?  It's porn.  The internet can illuminate or you can just jerk off to it.  like, that's just -- Alexander Graham Bell man, he invented the telephone; Watson, come quickly and bring a towel."  Like, that's what it is.  Like, that's -- everything that a man makes, everything that we have, can be used for good or evil.  Atomic energy; you can cut it one way and light the world, you can cut it another way, and blow the world up.  Like, that's the dilemma we face.  So, use your energy towards, as much as you can, towards the positive.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MELISSA:  Hi.  I'm Melissa.  I'm a second year in the college.  So, I know you spoke a little bit before about how comedy is just comedy, it's just satire.  But if you...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I don't -- I don't -- I should probably -- I don't mean it's just satire, like it's a trifle.  I'm really proud of it.  I think it's an amazing way to express yourself.  I meant that it cannot take the place of activism, so I don't mean it as a sense of -- it's just jokes folks.  It's not.  Satire is an expression of my true beliefs put through the prism -- the reason why it's not news is the tools of satire are hyperbole and pun, and denigration, you know, sh-- you can't get away with.  But, the expression of it may have a similar foundation.  So, I apologize for that.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MELISSA:  Well, on that note...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MELISSA:  ...there were a few criticisms and articles about John Oliver and Trevor Noah's work in doing satire, and talking about how they're basically doing the work of journalists in order to eliminate different issues.  Do you see the world of comedy skewing more towards a comedy-journalism hybrid in any way?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I see the world of journalism skewing more towards comedy, unfortunately.  I feel like they're moving towards our box.  No, I mean, I think part of -- you know, there is a certain form of -- what we did on the Daily Show was we took a, sort of, short form content and we tried to create a more essayistic version of that, utilizing principles of argument and logic with the comedy.  What that requires, at times, is a certain balance of foundational material, background, and without that background, it wouldn't make -- an essay doesn't make much sense without its premise statements and things, so that's where that comes from. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But, I don't think, you know, people will get tired -- art is always evolving into a lot of different ways, but that particular form, comedy generally requires a shared set of knowledge with its audience, so in the days of great scandal that's sweeping through the country, those jokes are easy because when Dick Cheney shot a guy in the face, that was an easy show to write because everybody knew Dick Cheney shot a guy in the face, so you didn't really have to go through the whole thing of like, "In 1972, Congress passed the Don't Shoot Your Friends Act.  Now, here's where--" Like, it was kind of like it was right there, so it was comedy tries to require the least amount of distance between your brain and your gut.  So when you have to fill that in, it can to detract from it, so it makes it difficult, so to be able to do that, like guys like Oliver, I really admire their ability to do that, but I don't think that's the new thing.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MCNICHOLAS:  Thank you so much for being here.

They were, I think, more of the mindset that people liked the pop culture and I was more the mindset that we could create something slightly different that would still bring in viewership.  I think they were feeling like we would be narrowing our focus, economically, and those shifts, generally, take time, but that's all it was, was that fight had to be fought.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  (Inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MCNICHOLAS:  Can I follow up?

But, in Illinois, I think you have a better chance of going to prison -- if you drop out of high school, you have less of a chance of going to prison than if you become governor.  All right.  I think, honestly, Watergate and Vietnam were the crucibles by which my mindset was shaped, much more than, you know, New Jersey, which is another whole set of problems.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MARK:  Hi.  So, my name is Mark.  I'm a big fan of the show and I'm actually very lucky because I'll be interning at the Daily Show this summer.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Hey, congratulations. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MARK:  Thank you.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  That'll be nice.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MARK:  So, this is more of a work advice...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  You know what?  Can I say this?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MARK:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Practice washing fruit.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MARK:  I'll do my best. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I just want to make sure you know the gig.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">MARK:  So, my question is, how do you keep your sanity amid the onslaught of 24-hour news networks, like for your job?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Well, I think -- were you here the whole time?  You don't.  it's a lot like, remember the movie The Green Mile?  Where you like, you don't -- people get lost in it and I think you begin to think that it's real life and you have to understand that when you watch it it's designed for a reason and the reason is to heighten urgency and anxiety so that you won't turn away, and you can begin to think that that's real, but it's not.  So, just keep that in mind, and Xanax.  Go ahead.  What?  Yeah?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Aztec.  So, Senator Republicans have done a pretty effective job in not confirming Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.  Now that the media has shifted their attention to November, do you think that the, "Let's wait until the next president chooses the Justice"?  Do you think that argument is valid now that there's six months until the election and what's your prediction on, you know, who's going to fill the seat?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  First of all, don't threaten me with those boxing gloves on your arm.  I know what's going on.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  I swear to God, I got hit by a truck on Friday, so I'm thankful for...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Wait.  You got hit by a truck?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Yes. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Well, let me just say this, the Merrick Garland question is interesting, but the truck story is f---ing phenomenal.  How did you get hit by a truck?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Let's just say that Hyde Park has some reckless drivers.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Oh right, it was 'the driver' in Hyde Park and in no way are you stoned on a unicycle.  All right.  Here's the question, so I have no idea, and as far as I'm concerned, they're f---ing themselves because the vote that's not there is one of the only reliably conservative votes, so any case that's coming up through this next year that was going to be a 5:4 decision for the conservatives is now moved, so they basically they're going to spend a year losing, pretty much, any case they had a shot with.  So, I don't know what to tell them.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">AXELROD:  Take one more question.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.  Yes.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Me? </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yes, sir.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Oh great. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Brothers and beards.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Thank you.  It's a new one.  I'm trying it out.  I wanted to ask you about the last interview on your who, which I think was Louis CK.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  So, from my memory, I think that was after some of the rumors about Louis CK's alleged harassment of female comedians...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Woah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  ...and sort of started to come out.  Just some things started (inaudible) on the internet.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Wait.  What?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  I think this was after Jen Kirkman, for example, had talked about like her knowledge of Louis CK's alleged harassment of female comedians...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  ...at least people interpreted it that way. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Yeah.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  There was an article on Gawker, I believe, about it.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  And I just wanted to know -- I mean, if this is the first you're hearing of it, maybe my I already got my answer that there really...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Oh, OK.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  ....wasn't discussion about this on the show, but I...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  No, wait, wait, wait.  I'm a little lost.  So, the internet said Louis harassed women?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  So, there was first a Gawker article and then there were a couple of tweets by people and I know this is all internet stuff.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Pretty authoritative.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  I know that this is how...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  You know who you're talking to, right? </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  No, I totally get that.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  All right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  And it's a fair point, that like internet rumors are not, you know, court case or anything.  I just wanted to know if there was any sort of discussion about that on the show; if that was a thing on your radar?</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  No.  I didn't see the tweets.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  No, or Jen Kirkman's podcast about (inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  No, I don't, and you know, and I apologize, I honestly, like, I'm not that connected to that world, so I do apologize.  I don't know what you're talking about.  But, I can't really add.  I don't know what to say.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  No definitely and I can turn that around and I think that's a good point is that a lot of people, at the time, didn't know what that was, and you know, again, like the internet is not for sure or anything like that, but just there have been comedians who have taken strong stances on Bill Cosby without like certain knowledge from Bill Maher to Hannibal Buress, but I was just wondered if you could talk about the role of comedians in (inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  But, as you pointed out...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Right.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  ...the Bill Cosby case actually is a legal case.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Now it is, but it wasn't when Bill Maher and Hannibal Buress started talking about it.  I just -- maybe you could speak to the role of comedians in (inaudible).</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  I mean, all I can tell you is I've worked with Louis for 30 years and like he's a wonderful man and person and I've never heard anything about this...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Sure.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  ...and we've all known Bill Cosby was a prick for a long time.  So, I don't know what to tell you.  But, I didn't know about the sexual assault.  But, you're right, it's important...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION:  Not sexual assault, like just...</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Or like whatever.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">QUESTION: ...like just harassment in general.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"> </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">STEWART:  Oh.
