Kevin Cain, a D.C. real estate agent who won one of the District's 19 slots for the Republican National Convention, informed the party Monday that he would give up his seat in protest of Donald Trump.

"I do not want my name on record in any way as having ever voted for, contributed to, or otherwise assisted him or his campaign," Cain wrote in a letter he then shared with friends on Facebook. "I firmly believe he is dangerous, to both the future of the party, and, were he to be elected, to the country itself."

Few Republican delegates have given up their tickets to Cleveland. Hundreds were elected as supporters of now-defeated candidates, but only one candidate, Trump endorser Ben Carson, has released his delegates. Some supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich hold out hope that they can pick a fight on the convention floor. More of them plan to defend the party's platform from any Trump-favored changes, and to alter the rules for the 2020 primary. Those were among the reasons that Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, easily won a delegate slot at this past weekend's Republican convention in Texas.

Cain, who like most active D.C. Republicans opposed Trump, declined an interview about everything else that went into his decision. His full letter is below:

I wanted to officially notify you that I would like to withdraw as a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention.

It now appears certain that Donald J. Trump will be the nominee of the Republican Party, and his is a candidacy that I simply cannot support.

I do not want my name on record in any way as having ever voted for, contributed to, or otherwise assisted him or his campaign. I firmly believe he is dangerous, to both the future of the party, and, were he to be elected, to the country itself. His bigotry, incitement of violence, misogyny and sheer ignorance of the major issues are all well known.

I will in no way endorse or support Hillary Clinton, but will instead write in a candidate of my choice. It pains me greatly that this will be the first Presidential election since 1984 that I have not voted for the nominee of my party. Instead, I plan to focus all of my efforts on keeping and winning seats in the House and Senate, as Mr. Trump seems well on his way to endangering our majorities in both bodies.

Thank you, Senator Rubioâs campaign, and the DC Republican Party for giving me this opportunity. I am saddened that I must decline, but I absolutely believe there are larger issues at stake here.
