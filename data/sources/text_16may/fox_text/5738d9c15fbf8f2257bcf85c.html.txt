Hillary Clinton padded her already commanding lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by winning the larger portion of the delegates allocated at Saturday's raucous Nevada State Democratic Convention.

Clinton took seven delegates, while Sanders walked away with five, according to local reports. As the results were announced, Sanders supporters in attendance shouted in protest, reacting to news that a number of Sanders supporters were barred from participating.

One local report showed that by a slim margin, Clinton's 1,695 supporters allowed to participate outnumbered Sanders' 1,662 backers.

Clinton won the state's caucuses back in February, earning her 13 delegates. Meanwhile Sanders got 10 delegates. The delegates awarded Saturday were in addition to those.
