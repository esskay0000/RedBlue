Supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in Las Vegas on Saturday and it got so out of hand, cops descended on the ballroom and threatened arrests.

Convention attendee and YouTube user Anie H. posted several photos of the action, as announcements were made over the loud speaker to leave the Paris Hotel or risk being arrested.





She said Las Vegas Metropolitan police entered from the back of the room and went to the front, and “they are literally going to force us to leave the room.”

As she spoke, people could be seen shouting and waving their fists and signs.

“So much for unity,” she said, as a man could be heard yelling, “Sit down!”

Meanwhile, another video showed a man lying on the floor near the front of the room.



“Stay back,” a person shouted.

“We need a medic in the front, we need a medic in the front,” a woman could be heard saying.

In another cell phone clip, Anie H. said, “They’re threatening us with arrest if we do not leave the convention site right now.”



“Bernie or bust!” a man shouted over the loud speaker.

“Everybody please leave out of here peacefully,” another man said, “and I promise you, we will pursue any and all remedies available under the law. Please leave!”

Attendees could be seen filing out, while others milled about.

“Shame on you Nevada Republican — oops — Democratic party,” Anie H. narrated.

Ashley Ector tweeted a photo of the police lining the front of the room. She referred to them as “brown shirts.”

The Las Vegas Sun reports there was “palpable tension” in the room.

âI think this was of course the fault of the party,â Sanders supporter Angie Morelli tells the paper. âWe wouldâve been able to do more democratic things, but the way they decided to do it messed us up.â

Sanders supporters were demanding a recount and were alleging a number of their delegates were not recognized at the convention.

Gee…..
you get paid activists “protesting” at a Trump rally and that’s all you hear about for a week.

Some 80 year old guy slaps an obnoxious monkey at a Trump rally it’s headline news and a national crisis for a month. Chimp outs never make the local news.

Everyone at that auditorium must have left their mommies basements for the day because they heard there was going to be some free Bernie weed and Hillary phones passed out. They rioted when that didn’t happen.

Michael Moore And Bill Maher Vow To Stop Trump – http://trib.al/G7nxi9h

Michael Moore looks like an obese bulldyke.  Which restroom does he use?

Both as he can’t fit into a single one!

1977: President Jimmy Carter (D) signs the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) guaranteeing home loans to low income families

1999: President Bill Clinton (D) puts the CRA on steroids, pushing Fannie & Freddie to increase the # of sub-prime loans.

2003: White House calls Fannie & Freddie a systematic risk.

2003: Barney Frank (D-MA) says Fannie & Freddie are not in crisis. He bashes Republicans for crying wolf and calls F & F financially sound.

2003: Democrats block the Republicans-sponsored regulations legislation.

2005: Sen Schumer, (D-NY) says âI think Fannie & Freddie over the years have done an incredible job.â

2006: Sen John McCrain (R-AZ) calls for reform. âFor years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that governs F & F and it needs to be reformed NOW.â

2007: Democrats again block reform legislation.

2008: Housing market collapses, Democrats blame the Republicans…

100% correct.

Why are all democrats obese?

Because McDonalds must take EBT.

Because most of them are pregger illegal aliens that are ready to shit out some more piglet anchor babies.

Free government food has too much fat in it. What they need to do is ‘work’ it off.

This is why you don’t let women vote!

The regular media won’t cover this. It bursts their fantasy bubble

Trump slogans = “Work for what you have. Take pride in yourself, families and homes. Personal responsibility”. 

Hillary and Bernie Zombie slogans = “Gimmeee Gimeee. Where’s my free shit!?!!? It’s someone elses fault we’re fat lazy losers! Wahhh! BuUSH!!!” etc etc etc.

Take off your shirt

Oh shut up and get back to eating your mom’s taco.

Trump slogan = use the bankruptcy code to avoid personal responsibility as needed.

A great insult to Sgt. Schultz, who was a good man at heart.

DEMOCRATS PRIDE THEMSELVES ON BEING THE PARTY OF TOLERANCE.

LOL…And the democrat politburo calls Trump totalitarian.

Exactly 100 years ago, America’s first progressive, Woodrow Wilson ran for president, promising Americans he would keep us out of the European War. He was elected and 1 year later, 175,000 American men would die in France and 3 million men would be drafted by the democrats..

AND enacted the INCOME TAX and enacted the Federal Reserve !

Bahahahahaha…. Dems suck.

And swallow.

It is to laugh! The liberals keep pointing the finger at Conservatives all the while not realizing three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Total DEBT outstanding in the US and the actual figure is now somewhere between $60 and $64 trillion at this stage.

Very little of the total $60+ trillion outstanding debt in the US has anything to do with the Federal Reserve or regulated banking system in the US which only has about $12 trillion of funds for all of the 7,000 member banks. 

Much of that DEBT outstanding has to do with MONEY BORROWED IN THE BOND MARKETS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES which has nothing whatsoever to do with the Federal Reserve and is totally outside the scope of regulation of the Federal Reserve and is regulated by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).

Within the $12 trillion regulated banking system the outstanding loans to customer deposits ratio is a record low 67%.

There is around $25 trillion sloshing around in the SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM which is nearly 6 times as much as the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and double the amount of the US M2 money supply. 

The breakdown of the $60 or so trillion of DEBT outstanding is approximately as follows by big picture category:

30% Federal Government Debt
20% Total Consumer Debt
23% Total Corporate Debt
27% Other debt including Municipalities

The federal government debt is presently around $19.2 trillion, Total consumer debt is around $12 trillion which includes about $1 trillion in consumer unsecured credit, $1 trillion in vehicle loans, $1.36 trillion in student loans, and about $8.64 trillion in real estate loans secured by mortgages.  The total corporate debt is around $14 trillion with a large percentage of that outstanding on corporate bonds which now have average interest rates of around 8.83%.  The balance is a mix of all other types of debt outstanding with the largest portion of that $16 trillion being municipal bonds issued by state and local authorities and agencies.

Whether it’s the “Federal” Reserve or not, it’s still Jewish Babylonian Banking.

WHAT IS KILLING THE ECONOMY IN THE US AND GLOBALLY IS VASTLY TOO MUCH DEBT, not too little, and that debt must be cut and revenues must be increased on the part of government to get that debt paid down.  

ALL GOVERNMENT DEBT IS NON-PRODUCTIVE DEBT as it leaves nothing in its wave BUT A TRAIL OF DEBT TO BE REPAID, unlike productive debt which is used to create INCOME SOURCES such as factories which can generate funds to pay off that debt.

There was NEVER ANY SURPLUS during the Clinton years, and the ONLY REASON THAT THE DEFICITS NARROWED SIGNIFICANTLY WAS DUE TO A REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED CONGRESS THAT ACTUALLY CUT FEDERAL SPENDING SIGNIFICANTLY in direct opposition to the massive spending increases that Clinton wanted.

The only way some accounts come up with BOGUS SURPLUSES is due to the way accounting was changed regarding the Social Security Trust Fund.

U.S. Federal Deficits, Presidents, and Congress

http://home.adelphi.edu/sbloch/deficits.html

EACH AND EVERY YEAR SINCE 1956 THE FEDERAL DEBT HAS RISEN BY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT with the huge increases in federal debt starting during the Reagan years at the beginning of which the federal debt was $1 trillion and and at the end of which the federal debt had nearly tripled to more than $2.8 trillion.

Millions of people were for Donald Trump from the very beginning and fully predicted that he would win the Republican nomination and I was one of those folks. About the only ones who got that wrong were the mainstream media people and the Hellery/Bernie pushers.

And the Bush family.

Government’s key role is to be FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE and set a proper example for its citizens and not run up debt that is DUE WITH INTEREST IN THE FUTURE FROM ITS CITIZENS, the latter of which is exactly what the US government (and many other governments) have been doing in spades for the past 35 years or so which is why we have the catastrophic global debt problem and its impending collapse.

Hey, as long as they don’t get the tab at the end of the day, Americans just love government debt.  My longstanding solution to that would be for the US government to send every single American of every age an INVOICE EVERY YEAR FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE FEDERAL DEBT.

$8,314,529,850,339.07: Debt Up $70,612.91 Per Household Under Obama…

http://cnsnews.com/news/article/831452985033907-debt-7061291-household-obamas-first-7-years

The US federal government has no conception of EVER BREAKING EVEN let alone having any money left over after its spending (profit).  The US government is the BIGGEST MONEY LOSING BUSINESS IN THE WORLD and needs to be run much more like an actual business instead of a HUGE LOSS FEST.

In 6 Months Since Budget Deal: Debt Up More Than $1 Trillion

At the close business on Oct. 30, 2015, the total federal debt was $18,152,981,685,747.52. By the close of business on April 28, 2016âthe latest date for which the Treasury has published the number–the total federal debt was $19,186,207,744,589.55.

That is an increase of $1,033,226,058,842.03.

On Monday, Nov. 2–the day Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act and thus suspended the debt limit–the debt took a big leap. It closed that day at $18,492,091,120,833.99âup $339,109,435,086.47 from its $18,152,981,685,747.52 closing on Friday, Oct. 30.

Prior to that, the part of the federal debt subject to the then-legal limit of $18,113,000,080,959.35 had been frozen just below that limit for more than seven months (from March 13, 2015 through Oct. 30, 2015), during a âdebt issuance suspension periodâ that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew had declared on March 13, 2015, to push back the date at which the debt limit would be exceeded.

According to the official summary of the law, Section 901 of the âBipartisan Budget Act,â which Congress passed on Oct. 30 and Obama signed Nov. 2, provided that the âpublic debt limit is suspended through March 15, 2017.â

The $1,033,226,058,842.03 increase in the debt in the six months since then equals approximately $6,828 for each of the 151,320,000 persons whom the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated had a full or part-time job in the United States as of this March.

Oh the Liberals WANT the POLICE PRESENT when THEY need them!

Cops are all retarded losers and wouldn’t do shit.

Your a sick pup!

Oh shut up and get back to munching on your mom’s taco.

So libs are all about having guns now? They certainly change their tune when the shoe is on the other foot, no?

Well to be fair now, Bernie is supporting the right to bear arms against the democrats who seek to remove them.

That’s what we conservatives have been supporting all along!

Libtards eating their own is a beautiful thang!  ð
TRUMP 2016!!!!!!!

Poor decision makers

All the rioters chimping out just need to smoke a few bowls, hold hands and sing James Taylor songs and get in touch with their inner child. Mmmkay?

If you are for more illegals, vote for Hillary.

If you are for more Muslim refugees, vote for Hillary.

If you are for more H1B and H2B visas, vote for Hillary.

If you are for gun bans, vote for Hillary.

If you are for higher taxes, vote for Hillary.

DEMOCRATS MUST KEEP BLACK AMERICANS POOR TO STAY IN POWER 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOuJbHkWgWM

Neegaz are a savage retarded worthless species that should have been exterminated decades ago.

The geriatric DNC, NEEDS A MEDIC!

I love it when the RINOs and Democrats try to give advice to Trump on how he needs to act in order to be electable. You would almost believe they want him to win the Presidency.

The DNC Politburo hates cops until they need them.

DEMOCRATS MUST KEEP BLACK AMERICANS ON WELFARE TO STAY IN POWER!

Every person in that room is a moron. Where is ISIS when you need ’em ??

ISIS is having gay orgies with Obama in the meantime.

Feeling the Bern yet Hillary?

You forgot that your base is actually a gaggle of dangerous malcontents didn’tcha?

I see you have it handled. You’ll be portrayed by your adoring media whores as a “real leader” or some such nonsense.

The worst part?
Every one of these so-called Bernie supporters WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY,  and she knows it.
It’s the “idiot” part of “useful idiot” that is the most appalling part for me.

the fact is they aren’t her supporters no one WANTS hillary… and bernie supporters are determined to either vote TRUMP or write in their vote… #neverhillary

Doubt it.  History proves that Democrats are lemmings.
They do as they’re told and they WILL VOTE FOR HILLARY no questions asked.

The latest polls are indicating they are finally on board over 39 % will not vote for her.

Polls?
Polls had Romney winning too.
Lest ye forget that they are polling DEMOCRATS and Democrats would lie if the truth sounded better.
I will go by historical EVIDENCE on this one thank you very much.

Send all the whining “African Americans” back to da Mother Land. See how long they last. Not a second. They’d poop their pants hanging over their monkey butts. No free shit in da Mother Land. Oook Ook ack ackk eeek eeek. Oooga Boooga.

Neegaz always be whining about something. They’re worse than illegal aliens and the gays. The gays are always mean and nasty and whining because their butts hurt. Never go to a pool or beach where gays are. Their butts leak and it’s nastier than muslims in a mexican jacuzzi.

It’s time to wrest our beloved country back from the Plutocrats who co-opted it when we weren’t paying attention. Each of the viable candidates, with the exception of Independent Bernie Sanders, is either a Plutocrat or a Plutocrat-Wannabee, who will only look out for the rich in order to protect their own wealth. All their policies will enrich themselves more and broaden the income gap. Any policies they’re currently spewing that are targeted to help the workers of America were stolen from Bernie (check the record). POLITICAL REVOLUTION NOW! Back to government OF the people, BY the people, and FOR the people. Enough is enough! BERNIE SANDERS 2016 feelthebern.org  berniesanders.com

Where’s the unity Sanders  been preaching?

Up inside your mom’s taco.

There is no unity when the brown shirts show up thanks to the DNC!

The liberal big tent…

How many blacks does it take to screw in a light bulb? Zero. They break them all trying to figure out what they is.

Hillary should get used to seeing a lot of armed guards in the near future.  But they won’t  be with the secret service
