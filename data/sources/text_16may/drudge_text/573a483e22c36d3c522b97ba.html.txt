Police say man shot, killed landlord over rent dispute 

Updated Monday morning..... It is snowing this morning in northern Maine and so far Caribou has picked up over 2 inches making this the biggest snow for ever so late in the season.

Here is a great comparison though. In 1894 on May 20, portions of eastern Kentucky up through southeast Indiana had up to 6 inches of snow. Flurries fell in Louisville.

Anyway, back to Maine..... The snow total for the season in Caribou is now at about 47 inches which is still about 19 inches below normal.

Radar shows the moderate to heavy snow will continue for a while longer.
    .


This is the same system that produced some snow in Cleveland yesterday morning where this classic photo was taken.


While many viewers are probably looking forward to the summer, there will be one less place to spend time out in the sun.
