Here are the networkâs official descriptions of every new show:

THE EXORCIST

Widely regarded as the greatest horror movie ever made, âThe Exorcistâ broke box office records and terrified audiences around the world. Now, more than four decades after the Academy Award-nominated film, THE EXORCIST returns as a TV series. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (âRise of the Planet of the Apesâ), THE EXORCIST is a propulsive psychological thriller following two very different priests tackling one familyâs case of horrifying demonic possession. FATHER TOMAS ORTEGA (Alfonso Herrera, âSense8,â âThe Chosenâ) is the new face of the Catholic Church: progressive, ambitious and compassionate. He runs a small but loyal parish in the suburbs of Chicago. He has no idea that his quiet life is about to change forever. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, another priest finds himself locked in a life-and-death struggle with evil. FATHER MARCUS BRENNAN (Ben Daniels, âFlesh and Bone,â âHouse of Cardsâ) is a modern-day Templar Knight, an orphan raised since childhood by the Vatican to wage war against its enemies. Father Marcus is everything Father Tomas is not: relentless, abrasive and utterly consumed by his sacred mission. Caught in the middle is the RANCE family, members of Tomasâ parish. On the surface, theyâre a normal, suburban family, but all is not as it seems in this household. The patriarch, HENRY RANCE (guest star Alan Ruck, âSpin City,â âFerris Buellerâs Day Offâ), is slowly but surely losing his mind. Eldest daughter KATHERINE (Brianne Howey, SCREAM QUEENS) has become a recluse who refuses to leave her room. Her younger sister, CASEY (Hannah Kasulka, âThe Fostersâ), thinks sheâs hearing strange noises coming from inside the walls.Â  And mother ANGELA (Academy Award and Golden Globe winner Geena Davis, âCommander in Chief,â âThelma & Louiseâ) has been plagued by recurring nightmares, each more frightening than the last. Angela believes there is something in the house, a demonic presence, growing stronger by the day. Desperate, she begs Father Tomas for help, unwittingly setting the naÃ¯ve young priest on a collision course with Father Marcus. Separately, each faces an insurmountable task, but together they become the only hope against an evil force that has been mobilizing for centuries.

LETHAL WEAPON

Combining action and drama with friendship and humor, LETHAL WEAPON reboots the hit movie franchise, as it follows classic cop duo Riggs and Murtaugh, who are working a crime-ridden beat in modern-day Los Angeles.Â Grief-stricken after the loss of his young wife and unborn child, ex-Navy SEAL-turned-detective MARTIN RIGGS (Clayne Crawford, âRectifyâ) moves to California to âstart overâ at the LAPD. Heâs paired up with ROGER MURTAUGH (Emmy Award nominee Damon Wayans, Sr., âMy Wife and Kids,â âIn Living Colorâ), whoâs just coming back to the job after a near-fatal heart attack. Riggsâ penchant for diving headfirst into the line of fire immediately clashes with Murtaughâs prudent, by-the-book technique. Itâs clear from the moment they meet, this partnership could be lethal. But during their first case together, Riggs drags Murtaugh on a high-speed chase culminating inside the Long Beach Grand Prix and into a seaport shootout with drug dealers â and despite his protests, the older cop feels more alive than he has in years. Meanwhile, Riggs gets a glimpse of why Murtaugh is so determined to get home safely at the end of each day â heâs got a family and a newborn baby of his own. By the time their investigation ends, Riggs realizes he may have found something worth living for â a partner and friend like Murtaugh. And even Murtaugh figures this arrangement might just work out after all. If only Riggs doesnât get them killed firstâ¦

SON OF ZORN

Featuring the voice of Jason Sudeikis (THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, âHorrible Bosses,â âWeâre the Millersâ), SON OF ZORN is a new hybrid live-action/animated comedy about an animated warrior from a faraway island in the Pacific Ocean â where everything and everyone is animated â who returns to Orange County, CA, to win back his live-action ex-wife and teenage son. ZORN (Sudeikis), the Defender of Zephyria, Conqueror of the tribes of Agon, decapitator of the dark herdsmen of Grith, has fought in countless epic battles throughout his life, but may find the greatest challenge of all when travels back to suburbia to reconnect with his family. Once there, Zorn finds himself estranged from his son, ALANGULON or just âAlanâ (Johnny Pemberton, â21 Jump Streetâ), a 17-year-old with a mellow, P.C. attitude; and Alanâs mother, Zornâs ex-wife, EDIE (Cheryl Hines, âCurb Your Enthusiasmâ), a former wild child now living the life of an upper middle class mom. Zornâs efforts to win them back are complicated by the fact that Edie is now engaged to CRAIG (Tim Meadows, âSaturday Night Liveâ), an online psychology professor and a stable presence in their lives. Nevertheless, to be a good dad, Zorn commits to remaining in Orange County for the long haul, renting an apartment and even working in the exciting field of industrial soap sales under his boss, LINDA (Artemis Pebdani, âScandal,â âItâs Always Sunny in Philadelphiaâ), who likes his passion, but just wants him to rein it in at the office. As he adjusts to life in the suburbs, Zorn is the classic fish out of water, navigating his way through fatherhood, divorce and a boring office job. Sure, as an overlord of pain, he defeated glombeasts, wolf-bats and bloodthirsty arachnobots, but now heâll go toe-to-toe with a new set of enemies: meter maids, dress codes and the DMV.

The following new dramas will debut in midseason on FOX:

24: LEGACY

The clock ticks again with 24: LEGACY, the next evolution of the Emmy Award-winning â24.â From Emmy Award-winning executive producer Howard Gordon (âHomeland,â â24: Live Another Dayâ), Academy Award- and Emmy Award-winning executive producer Brian Grazer (âA Beautiful Mind,â â24â), writers and executive producers Manny Coto and Evan Katz (â24,â â24: Live Another Dayâ), director and executive producer Stephen Hopkins (â24â) and executive producer and original series star Kiefer Sutherland, 24: LEGACY chronicles an adrenaline-fueled race against the clock to stop a devastating terrorist attack on United States soil â in the same real-time format that has propelled this genre-defining series. Six months ago in Yemen, an elite squad of U.S. Army Rangers, led by Sergeant ERIC CARTER (Corey Hawkins, âStraight Outta Comptonâ), killed terrorist leader Sheik Ibrahim Bin-Khalid. In the aftermath, Bin-Khalidâs followers declared a fatwah against Carter, his squad and their families, forcing them into federal witness protection. But a recent attempt on Carterâs own life makes it clear to him that his team is now exposed. To thwart further attacks, Carter enlists REBECCA INGRAM (Miranda Otto, âHomelandâ), who quarterbacked the raid that killed Bin-Khalid. Sheâs a brilliant and ambitious intelligence officer who has stepped down from her post as National Director of CTU to support her husband, SENATOR JOHN DONOVAN (Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner Jimmy Smits, âNYPD Blue,â âThe West Wingâ), in his campaign for President of the United States. Decades of sleepless nights and missed anniversaries landed her at the top. With the White House within their grasp, can she truly embrace a new role as First Lady? Or will her love of the action draw her back in? Together, in this fast-paced thrill ride, Carter and Ingram uncover a sophisticated terrorist network that will force them to ask: âWho can we trust?â As they battle Bin-Khalidâs devotees, they are forced to confront their own identities, families and pasts.

STAR

Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee Lee Daniels â creator and executive producer of broadcastâs No. 1 series, EMPIRE â partners with Tom Donaghy (âThe Whole Truthâ) to pull back the curtain on musicâs gritty and dark reality in STAR.

PITCH

From executive producers Dan Fogelman (âCars,â âCrazy, Stupid, Love.â) and Rick Singer (âYounger,â âAmerican Dadâ), PITCH is the dramatic and inspirational story of a young pitcher who becomes the first woman to play Major League Baseball. A beautiful, tough and gifted athlete, GINNY BAKER (Kylie Bunbury, âUnder The Domeâ) is vaulted into instant fame when sheâs called up by the San Diego Padres to make her Major League debut. Like any rookie, Ginny must prove herself to her teammates. Foremost among them is MIKE LAWSON (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, âFranklin & Bash,â âNYPD Blueâ), the teamâs ruggedly handsome star catcher. Thereâs instant chemistry between them, although neither dares admit it. After all, Mike is captain of the team and a few of his players donât even want Ginny on the field. One of the players watching Ginnyâs back is center fielder BLIP SANDERS (Mo McRae, âSons of Anarchyâ), an old friend from the minor leagues. Guiding her is her agent/confidante AMELIA SLATER (Ali Larter, âLegends,â âHeroesâ). Amelia saw Ginnyâs star potential early on and left her previous job as a Hollywood publicist to concentrate on the young phenom. Although groomed for this moment by her demanding father, BILL BAKER (guest star Michael Beach, âSons of Anarchyâ), the end of Ginnyâs improbable journey is the beginning of an almost impossible one: representing her gender as she embarks on a successful baseball career under the glare of the white-hot media spotlight. Itâs a goal hard enough for anyone to achieve â except this player is also a woman, who happens to be the most important historical figure in sports since Jackie Robinson. This season, Ginny Baker will be the other woman trying to break into one of the oldest, most exclusive menâs clubs in the country.

APB

Police work isnât rocket science. Itâs harder. Inspired by true events,Â APB is a new police drama with a high-tech twist from executive producer/director Len Wiseman (LUCIFER, âUnderworldâ) and executive producer/writer Matt Nix (âBurn Noticeâ). Sky-high crime, officer-involved shootings, cover-ups and corruption: the over-extended and under-funded Chicago Police Department is spiraling out of control. Enter billionaire engineer GIDEON REEVES (Emmy Award and Golden Globe nominee Justin Kirk, âTyrant,â âWeedsâ). After his best friend is murdered in a botched attempted robbery, and the killer remains at large, Gideon demands justice. Putting up millions of dollars of his own money, he makes an unprecedented deal to take over the troubled 13th District â and reboot it as a private police force:better, faster and smarter than anything seen before. With cutting-edge technology created by Gideon himself, this eccentric yet brilliant outsider challenges the cityâs police force to rethink everything about the way they fight crime. But the near-overnight transition to the cityâs most advanced police district doesnât sit well with all of its members. Gideon knows if heâs going to change anything, he needs an ally, whom he finds in OFFICER THERESA MURPHY (Natalie Martinez, âKingdom,â âUnder the Domeâ), an ambitious, street-smart cop who is ready to embrace Gideonâs technological changes.Â With the help of Gideonâs gifted tech officer, ADA HAMILTON (Caitlin Stasey âReignâ), he and Murphy embark on a mission to turn the 13the District â including a skeptical SGT. NED CONRAD (Ernie Hudson, âGrace and Frankie,â âGhostbustersâ), and determined OFFICERS NICHOLAS BRANDT (Taylor Handley âVegas,â âSouthlandâ) and TASHA GOSS (Tamberla Perry âBossâ) â into a dedicated crime-fighting force of the 21st century.

PRISON BREAK

PRISON BREAK is back and ready for its biggest escape yet. In the thrilling new event series PRISON BREAK, original series stars Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell, Sarah Wayne Callies, Amaury Nolasco, Robert Knepper, Rockmond Dunbar and Paul Adelstein are reunited for an all-new adventure spanning the globe and featuring the signature thrills and cliffhangers that were hallmarks of the original series when it aired on FOX from 2005-2009. The original action drama centered on MICHAEL SCOFIELD (Miller, âThe Loftâ), a young man determined to save his convicted brother, LINCOLN BURROWS (Purcell, âDCâs Legends of Tomorrowâ), from death row by hatching an elaborate plan to escape from prison. In the all-new event series, filmed on location in Morocco, clues surface that suggest a previously thought-to-be-dead Michael may be alive. Lincoln and SARA (Sarah Wayne Callies, âColony,â âThe Walking Deadâ), Michaelâs wife until he was assumed dead, reunite to engineer the seriesâ biggest escape ever, as three of Fox River State Penitentiaryâs most notorious escapees, SUCRE (Nolasco, âTelenovelaâ), T-BAG (Knepper, âHeroesâ) and C-NOTE (Dunbar, âThe Mentalistâ), are pulled back into the action. âPrison Breakâ was an immediate critical and ratings hit when it premiered on FOX in the fall of 2005, garnering Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Television Series â Drama and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series â Drama (Miller). The original producing team, including series creator Paul T. Scheuring, Neal Moritz, Marty Adelstein and Dawn Olmstead, will return to executive-produce the new series, with Scheuring serving as showrunner/writer.

SHOTS FIRED

Examining the dangerous aftermath of racially charged shootings in a small Southern town, SHOTS FIRED is a dramatic new event series that is a âwhy done it?â and a âwho done it?â From Gina Prince-Bythewood (âBeyond the Lights,â âThe Secret Life of Bees,â âLove & Basketballâ) and Reggie Rock Bythewood (âBeyond the Lights,â âNotoriousâ), the 10-hour event series is an explosive look at the criminal justice system. When an African-American police officer kills an unarmed white college student, a small town in North Carolina is turned upside-down. Before the town has a chance to grapple with this tragedy, the neglected murder of an African-American teen is brought to light, re-opening wounds that threaten to tear the town apart. Leading the Department of Justiceâs inquiry into these shootings is seasoned investigator ASHE AKINO (Sanaa Lathan, âThe Perfect Guyâ) and a young Special Prosecutor, PRESTON TERRY (Stephan James, âRace,â âSelmaâ), both of whom are African-American.Â As they start to pull back the layersÂ of both cases, they suspect a cover-upÂ thatÂ may involve some of the stateâs most powerful people, including fiercely political North Carolina Governor PATRICIA EAMONS (Academy-, Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning actress Helen Hunt, âAs Good As It Gets,â âThe Sessionsâ). Sheâs in a tough re-election fight, and the recent shootings in her state are making it even tougher. Meanwhile, real estate mogul and owner of a privatized prison ARLEN COX (Academy- and Golden Globe Award-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss, âThe Goodbye Girl,â âJaws,â âMadoffâ), is pulled into the case, as LT. ERIC BREELAND (Stephen Moyer, âThe Bastard Executioner,â âTrue Bloodâ), a seasoned veteran in the townâs Sheriffâs Department, gets caught in the middle of the investigation. SHOTS FIRED tackles the racial divide from all perspectives. As Ashe and Preston navigate the media attention, public debate and social unrest that come with such volatile cases, they learn that everybody has a story, and that the truth is rarely black and white.

The following new comedies will debut in midseason on FOX:

THE MICK

THE MICK is a no-holds-barred single-camera comedy that gives new meaning to the phrase âdysfunctional family.â MACKENZIE aka âMICKEYâ (Kaitlin Olson, âItâs Always Sunny in Philadelphiaâ) is a brash, two-bit hustler from Rhode Island who has spent her entire life shirking any semblance of responsibility. Lacking any drive, but in constant search of the next easy payday, Mickey is not without her charms. Sheâs smart, sheâs fun, and despite all appearances, her headâs always in the game. She just needs a big win. That win kinda, sorta comes true when, looking for a handout, Mickey visits her estranged sister and billionaire brother-in-law in Greenwich, CT, but gets more than she bargained for, as this absurdly rich couple flees the country to escape federal fraud charges. In a surprising turn of events, Mickey must assume guardianship of their three high-maintenance and ill-parented children: SABRINA (Sofia Black DâElia, âThe Messengers,â âGossip Girlâ), an ambitious, 18-going-on-30-year-old who is a worthy adversary to Mickey; CHIP (Thomas Barbusca, âThe New Normal,â âGreyâs Anatomyâ), 13, an arrogant, entitled neo-con-in-the-making with an extremely punchable face; and BEN (newcomer Jack Stanton), seven, an adorably fragile nerd. The life that Mickey has wanted for so long now is within her reach â the mansion, the convertible, the swimming pool, the walk-in closet full of designer clothes. But as Mickey is well aware, nothing in life is free. The price? Transforming these outrageously spoiled children into honest, hard-working, decent members of society â something this foul-mouthed, debaucherous and completely out-of-her-element woman knows absolutely nothing about. Being a mother was never in Mickeyâs game plan, but these kids desperately need a parent. And as irresponsible as Mickey has been her entire life, she may discover that responsibility and motherhood arenât the buzzkill she always thought they would be.

MAKING HISTORY

Produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (âLego Movie,â â21 Jump Streetâ), and written by Julius âGoldyâ Sharpe (âThe Grinder,â FAMILY GUY), the new comedy MAKING HISTORY follows three friends from two different centuries as they try to balance the thrill of time travel with the mundane concerns of their present-day lives. Two shows in one, itâs both a rollicking historical adventure, and a contemporary comedy about love, friendship and trying to fit in to an increasingly complex and impersonal world. DAN CHAMBERS (Adam Pally, âThe Mindy Project,â âHappy Endingsâ), a computer science professor at a small Massachusetts college, recently discovered time travel and has been transporting himself back to the 1700s to spend time with the colonial woman heâs fallen for. In the present, Dan is an unpopular nerd. But by claiming song lyrics, lines from movies and stand-up bits as his own in the 18th century, heâs absolutely hilarious â he gets the girl and makes friends. But Danâs actions in the past are messing up the present. That woman heâs dating is not just any woman. Sheâs Paul Revereâs daughter, DEBORAH (Leighton Meester, âGossip Girlâ), and Danâs meddling in the past causes her father to delay his famous ride, which may have altered the outcome of the entire American Revolution. To set matters right, Dan enlists the help of his colleague, CHRIS PARISH (Yassir Lester, âGirls,â âKey and Peeleâ), a brilliant, polished and popular history professor, whoâs now given the incredible opportunity to actually live the history he teaches. Can Dan, Chris and Deborah save America as we know it?Â Can a woman from 1775 adapt to life in 2016?Â Can the three intrepid time travelers improve the past, help the helpless, fight for justice and get rich?

The following new reality series will debut in midseason on FOX:

KICKING & SCREAMING

KICKING & SCREAMING is a new competition series that teams 10 expert survivalists with pampered partners to face the toughest challenges of their lives. From executive producer Matt Kunitz (âWipeout,â âFear Factorâ), in association with Lionsgate Television, and hosted by Hannah Simone (NEW GIRL), the series drops these unlikely duos into a tropical jungle in Fiji, where they must overcome dangerous animals, raging rivers, hunger and extreme weather. While these no-nonsense survivalists are accustomed to fending for themselves, thereâs one thing for which none of their previous expeditions have prepared them: theirÂ nature-phobic partners, who think âglampingâ is roughing it. To win the competition, and a cash prize of $500,000, the experts will have to drag their partners, KICKING & SCREAMING, to the finish line.

MY KITCHEN RULES

The No. 1 show in Australia for five years running is coming to FOX. The unscripted cooking series will pit celebrity duos against each other as they cook and critique each otherâs food, in Hollywood homes. The teams will take turns hosting intimate dinner parties with a menu designed to impress their rival competitors and two professional chef judges, Curtis Stone (âTop Chef Mastersâ) and Cat Cora (âIron Chef Americaâ). Celebrities featured on the series include Lance Bass, Brandy & Ray J, Andrew Dice Clay, Brandi Glanville and Naomi Judd. With escalating rounds of competition, the celebrity duo with the lowest score at the end of each round will be eliminated. The last two teams standing will battle it out in the final round for a pressure-cooker evening during which they will prepare and present their ultimate dining menu. In the end, only one team will survive the heat, the drama and the right to claim MY KITCHEN RULES.
