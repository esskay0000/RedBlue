Upset Bernie Sanders supporters booed California Sen. Barbara Boxer , a Hillary Clinton supporter, during a contentious Nevada Democratic Convention Saturday.

“We need civility in the Democratic Party, civility,” Boxer said as Sanders supporters booed the senator. Clinton won the Nevada Caucus and received more delegates than Sanders at the Saturday convention. Bernie supporters upset with the convention results started chants of “recount.”

Hillary Clinton has an almost insurmountable lead over Sanders, and a victory by the Vermont senator would require Clinton’s super-delegates to switch their support.

Now Clinton is attempting to unify the Democratic Party which is turning out to be a tough task. Her campaign sent out a fundraising email Saturday complaining about having to still compete against Sanders instead of concentrating on Donald Trump.

One Sanders delegate at the convention yelled, “Fuck Hillary and Fuck the DNC” during his speech.

“When you’re booing me, you’re booing Bernie Sanders,” Boxer told the crowd. “You know something I grew up in Brooklyn I’m not afraid of bullies. I’m for Hillary Clinton because she’s for all of us.Â So keep yourselves booing and boo yourself out of the election,” the California senator added.

“We had our Nevada Caucus and Hillary Clinton won,” Boxer told the defiant crowd of upset Sanders supporters.
