THE BROOKINGS Institution and the Wilson Centre, two Washington think-tanks, are putting the âfunâ in âfunding the federal governmentâ. They have launched an online minigame which challenges all comers to balance the budget (or at least, keep the debt-to-GDP ratio from rising) over 25 years, without throwing their favourite policies overboard. Choose imprudently and the âfiscal shipââalso the title of the gameâwill sink. The wonks hope to reach perhaps half a million voters and schoolchildren who might otherwise never realise that tweaking the corporate tax code can be fun. The Wilsonâs Centreâs previous effort, âBudget Heroâ, was played over 2m times. Hopefully, players will find it easier to control spending than the think-tanks did: the new game set them back about $1m.
