Donald Trump is sending mixed signals about one of his most-criticized proposals, a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.

"No,Â I'm not softening my stance at all," the Republican presidential candidateÂ said Friday on NBC's Today show. "But I'm always flexible on issues."

In recent days, Trump has described the proposed ban as a "suggestion" but has also said he's sticking by it.

Some Republicans who are leery of supporting the volatile New York businessman have welcomed the suggestions that he may back away from the ban. Others have expressed concern about Trump's proposed "flexibility," a term he has applied to a variety of plans.

During the NBC interview, Trump said the goal is to try to prevent terrorists from entering the country. The presumptive GOP nominee has also said he would appoint a commission to study the Muslim issue.

"We have a major problem and we have to look at the problem, we have to solve the problem," Trump said.
