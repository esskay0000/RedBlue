In the first big ante of the season, GOP Sen. Rob Portmanâs campaign announced Thursday it had reserved $14 million worth of TV ad time to push his re-election bid in Ohio in a race that could help determine which party controls the Senate. The campaign will spend another $1 million on YouTube ads.

The move makes Portman the first Senate candidate in the country to reserve airtime through Election Day, a clear signal that he is anticipating a brutal race. Portman faces former Democratic governorÂ Ted Strickland in a race that polls show is a virtual tie.

Given Ohioâs status as a pivotal battleground state, Portman is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in 2016. The Ohio Republicanâs bid for a second term is complicated by Donald Trumpâs status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.

Trumpâs controversial positions and incendiary rhetoric have alienated women, minorities, and moderates â voting blocs that Portman will need to win re-election.

But Strickland has lagged far behind Portman in fundraising, and the Ohio Democrat may have a hard time responding to Portmanâs advertising blitz.

Portman raised $2.4 million in the first three months of the year, and he ended March with $13.5 million in the bank. Strickland raised about $1.5 million in that quarter and he closed March with $2.7 million in cash on hand.

âOur paid media campaign will detail what is at stake in the Ohio Senate race: Rob's vision for a brighter future or a return to Ted Strickland's Ohio when the state lost more than 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation,â Portmanâs campaign manager, Corry Bliss, said in a statement. âThe days of Ted Strickland hiding from his awful record are over â every Ohio voter will soon learn why Ted is the worst Senate candidate in America.â

Michawn Rich, a spokesman for Portmanâs campaign, said this would not be a typical ad blitz. The campaign plans to micro-target voters in different regions across the state, using highly sophisticated data to reach different demographic groups.

David Bergstein, a spokesman for Strickland, said the ad buy wouldnât erase Portmanâs electoral problems. He pointed to aÂ poll released Wednesday byÂ Quinnipiac University that found that 42% of registered Ohio voters said they didnât know enough about Portman to have an opinion.

âGiven the fact that 40 percent of voters canât pick Senator Portman out of a lineup, itâll cost him at least $15 million to fix his embarrassing lack of name identification,â Bergstein said. âNo amount of money can change the fact that Portman is the ultimate Washington insider with a decades-long career of backing unfair trade deals that have sent hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs overseas to places like China â or that Portman is running alongside Donald Trump, the most toxic presidential nominee in modern history.â

The Buckeye Stateâs Senate race is among a handful that will determine which party controls the Senate in 2017.
