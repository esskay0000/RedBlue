Since his time as House speaker ended last fall, John Boehner's beenÂ getting used to retirement.

He's got plenty of time. A lot of money. He could do anything he wants, but one of Boehner's favorite pastimes as a retiree has been straight-up clowning on Ted Cruz.

Since leaving office, Boehner's publicly called Cruz "Â aÂ miserable son of a bitch," and thenÂ "Lucifer" before that.

And on Thursday, while speakingÂ at a conferenceÂ in Las Vegas, Boehner expressed glee at Cruz's failed presidential bid.

"Thank God that guy from Texas didnât win," Boehner said,Â per theÂ Wall Street Journal.

Boehner then reportedly riffed on the blowback he got from calling Cruz Lucifer:

Listen: Boehner could beÂ on some far-flung beach right now, getting even more tan, sipping drinks out of coconutsÂ with thoseÂ little umbrellas in them. He could be on a Carnival Cruise Line ship hustling fellow retireesÂ in shuffleboard. He could do anything.

But no.Â John BoehnerÂ wakes up every morning, it seems, with a singular thought, a unified focus: "How will I trash Ted Cruz on this day?"

Is it sporting? Probably not. Does it enliven all of our Twitter timelines? Yes, yes it does.

To be fair, this isn't just a post-retirement fixation for John Boehner.Â He also reportedly called Cruz "a jackass" while still House speaker.

The animosity of course stems from Boehner's frustration with Cruz overÂ Texas senator'sÂ famous lack of compromise, which stymied many a deal among Republican leadersÂ in Congress.

We know how this began. We know not how it will end. Buckle up and grab some popcorn.
