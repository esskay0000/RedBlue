Clinton: People should stop listening to GOP "propaganda"

         HOPKINSVILLE, Ky.        (AP) -- Hillary Clinton says it&apos;s "time people stopped listening to Republican propaganda."

The remark was pushback from the likely Democratic presidential nominee against a vocal critic during a rally in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on Monday.  Clinton was praising the record of former Gov. Steven Beshear, a Democrat, noting education and employment gains, as well as his expansion of Medicaid under President Barack Obama&apos;s health care overhaul. Clinton then said that Republican Gov. Matt Bevin is "trying to undo it all."

A woman then stood up and yelled, "Wait a minute that&apos;s not true."

"Oh yes it is, ma&apos;am," Clinton shot back, amid cheers. "You are entitled to your opinion, but you&apos;re not entitled to your own facts."

Clinton continued that because of Medicaid, "hundreds of thousands of working Kentuckians have health care."
