The bottom line is the V.A. is antiquated. There's no need for a V.A. healthcare system as it existed after World War — why? Because we have the best private healthcare system in the world, we didn't need — we needed it in 1950's, hospitals were not particularly advanced, so, we built the best. We didn't maintain the best. Government didn't keep its promises to its veterans. So, what we need to do is two things. Number one, we need to allow veterans to go to private sector hospitals for their routine and ordinary care to get the best care in their community possible. [applause]
