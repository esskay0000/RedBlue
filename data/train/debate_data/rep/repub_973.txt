We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts â€” we're not running a surplus in Ohio. But, you see, what's getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn't come. Then they put more outsiders in because we're putting people in that don't understand compromise. They don't understand policy...[bell ringing] [applause]...They're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.
