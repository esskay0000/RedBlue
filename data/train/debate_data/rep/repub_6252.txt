But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate â€” what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
