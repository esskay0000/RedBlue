It's not just throwing out the tax code to break the back of the special interests that control Washington. It's other reforms. I would propose a law -- right now there are over 400 former members of the House and Senate who are registered lobbyists in Washington. I would propose a law on day one, you serve one day in the House or Senate, there's a lifetime ban on you ever being a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.
