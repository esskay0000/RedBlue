The other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, "Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail." Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen â€” one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died.
