I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States â€” this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented... [bell rings] ... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
