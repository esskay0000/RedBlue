I'm one of the few people up here who actually believes that we need a level playing field when it comes to manufacturing. That means a good tax code, a good regulatory environment, low energy prices, better opportunities for workers to get training, and, also, I'm â€” a supporter of the EXIM bank. Everybody else on this stage, everybody else, I think, in the entire field, is opposed to it.
