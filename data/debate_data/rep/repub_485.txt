That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day...[applause]...because this election is too important. What's at stake is the future of this country. And I believe â€” I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I've always believed that God has blessed America, that God's hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. [applause]
