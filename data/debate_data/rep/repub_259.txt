As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief...[bell rings]...who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. [applause]
