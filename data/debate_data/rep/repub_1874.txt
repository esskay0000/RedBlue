I've done it — I did it in Washington — four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened. [bell ringing] I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that. [applause]
