One last thing. I will tell you this, they're building those artificial islands in the South China Sea and the president won't — up until recently, wouldn't sail a ship within 12 miles or fly a plane over it. I'll tell you this, the first thing I'll do with the Chinese is I'll throw — I'll fly Air Force One over those islands. They'll know we mean business. [applause]
