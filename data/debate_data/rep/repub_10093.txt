JINDAL: You know, I have spent a lot of time tonight talking about the need to cut the size of government. The reason I'm doing that â€” it's not just about balancing the budget, or balancing a bunch of numbers. Because I believe in the American dream. I think President Obama's done a lot of damage to our country. I think that one of the worst things he has done is try to change the idea of America to be one of dependence. There are a lot of politicians that talk about cutting government spending, I'm the only one that's actually done it that's running for President.
