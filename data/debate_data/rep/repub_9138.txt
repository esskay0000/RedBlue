We have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn't even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors â€” hostage. He didn't mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn't respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn't respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.
