HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, Trish, I don't know why we have to move away from manufacturing. The only reason we have is because... [applause] ...we have a tax code that has punished manufacturing. I hear a lot of people talk about the plans to simplify the tax code. I've got one better than any of the simplifications, it's called a, "Fair Tax", and it eliminates all of the taxes on our productivity.
