She tried to wash her eyes, left work and went to bed early, hoping they would feel less sore the next day. But when she woke up, her vision was worse &ndash; everything was so blurry she struggled to read the time on the clock. Twenty-four hours later, she could not tell night from day.</p><blockquote><p> O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s colleagues assumed Yvonne was faking it, perhaps for some kind of lawsuit. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no Oscar for that performance,&rdquo; one muttered </p></blockquote><p>Except after six months of examinations, doctors could find nothing wrong with Yvonne&rsquo;s eyes. She was eventually admitted to the neurology unit where O&rsquo;Sullivan was working. During the observations, Yvonne&rsquo;s eyes would flicker between her husband and the doctors; as the consultant moved an ophthalmoscope close to her eyes, she blinked. It certainly seemed like her eyes were responding to her surroundings, yet she continued to claim that she was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.</p><p>O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s colleagues assumed she was faking it, perhaps for some kind of lawsuit. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no Oscar for that performance,&rdquo; one muttered after they had left the ward. O&rsquo;Sullivan herself was unconvinced. &ldquo;I liked Yvonne. I felt sorry for her. But I did not believe she was blind,&rdquo; she writes in her new book It&rsquo;s All in Your Head, recently shortlisted for the <a href=\"http://wellcomebookprize.org/\">Wellcome Book Prize</a>.</p><p>Now she knows better. At the Royal London Hospital she has become an expert in &ldquo;psychosomatic&rdquo; illnesses. She has treated people who are paralysed from the waist down, or who have such severe cramp in their fingers that their hand has become little more than a claw; one woman could not even empty her bladder without a medical catheter. Yet when doctors look, they can find no physiological cause &ndash; suggesting the problem originates in the mind, not the body.</p><p>In this light, it&rsquo;s perfectly possible that Yvonne really wasn&rsquo;t conscious of what she was seeing &ndash; somehow, her unconscious mind was discarding the information before she became aware of it.</p><p>Keen to know more, I spoke to O&rsquo;Sullivan about her career and her recent book detailing these remarkable case studies.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03qb67m\"}}</p><p>Although O&rsquo;Sullivan had seen patients like Yvonne from the very beginning of her career, the interest intensified once she started specialising in epilepsy. Patients would often come to her suffering from debilitating seizures that left them writhing around on the floor, limbs flailing, helpless, yet when they came in to the hospital for neurological tests, they showed none of the signature brain activity of epilepsy; they were &ldquo;psychogenic&rdquo; seizures. &ldquo;It became obvious no one is talking about these problems that are consistently common, but which are getting no attention in medical journals or medical conferences,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This is a very neglected area.&rdquo;</p><p>That silence brings stigma, meaning that most patients end up feeling insulted by the diagnosis. &ldquo;Their first reaction is &lsquo;you think I&rsquo;m doing it on purpose&rsquo; or &lsquo;you think it&rsquo;s not real&rsquo; or &lsquo;I could stop it if wanted&rsquo;,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this perception that there is a degree of wilfulness&rdquo;.</p><p>If you find their symptoms hard to believe, consider the many profound ways that your emotions already move your body. O&rsquo;Sullivan points out that every time we cry, or laugh, or shake with anger, if we feel so sad that it is hard to lift ourselves from our bed, or queasy with nausea after we hear of a friend&rsquo;s food poisoning, then we are experiencing psychosomatic phenomena first-hand. In fact, up to 30% of people visiting their family doctor or GP (and 50% of women seeing their gynaecologist) are enduring symptoms that cannot be explained with a physical cause &ndash; suggesting they may be psychosomatic in origin. The difference is that for most of us those feelings pass and we can return to our normal lives, but for O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s patients they are exaggerated and chronic, lasting months, years, even a lifetime.</p><blockquote><p> They really are disabled. They are more disabled than most people with a physical disease </p></blockquote><p>She emphasises that the psychological origin does not make the blindness, fatigue, seizures or paralysis any less debilitating. &ldquo;They really are disabled. They are more disabled than most people with a physical disease.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03qb6d0\"}}</p><p>Consider Camilla, a lawyer in London, who had been diagnosed with epilepsy before O&rsquo;Sullivan managed to show that it was psychogenic. She described how humiliating she found the seizures; how people try to help by sitting on her to stop her limbs from flailing about, and stick their fingers down her throat to stop her choking; one man knelt beside her, asking if she was OK, before stealing her mobile phone. &ldquo;But do you know what happens all the time? People video me on their mobile phones and walk away laughing,&rdquo; she told O&rsquo;Sullivan. The more you know about these patients, the harder it is to believe that anyone would deliberately expose themselves to this humiliation.</p><p>O&rsquo;Sullivan has nevertheless met a few fakers, such as Judith, who claimed to be suffering seizures as the side-effect of chemotherapy for leukaemia years before. Hoping to get to the bottom of the story, O&rsquo;Sullivan called her into a hospital ward, where a video camera could film a seizure when or if it occurred. Sure enough, at 9:15 in the evening, a nurse found Judith lying on the floor unconscious, falling so hard that she had apparently fractured her hand. When O&rsquo;Sullivan played back the video, however, she saw there had been no seizure at all. Judith had simply raised her hand and hit it hard against the wall four times, before lying down gently on the floor, pulling down a plate with her to attract the nurse. Indeed, looking at the medical records, it became clear that Judith had never suffered from leukaemia, either.</p><blockquote><p> What kind of mental torment would make someone invent an illness? </p></blockquote><p>Although such patients with &ldquo;factitious&rdquo; illnesses may add to the stigma of people like Camilla or Yvonne, O&rsquo;Sullivan still feels compassion for these people. After all, what kind of mental torment would make someone behave in this way? Even if Judith hadn&rsquo;t suffered from leukaemia, perhaps she had witnessed it in someone else &ndash; an experience she found difficult to process in any other way? &ldquo;Factitious illness is one of most serious disorders I know,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03qb6l5\"}}</p><p>There is currently precious little research on the best way to treat psychosomatic illness, but she tends to refer her patients to psychiatrists or to a cognitive behavioural therapist (CBT) who might be able to unknot the distress or trauma that is leading to the illness.</p><p>And there are some real success stories. Not all cases can be pinned to a specific event, but Camilla realised that her seizures may have been linked to the death of her young son, setting her on the path to recovery. Yvonne, meanwhile, seemed to have been struggling to juggle the stresses of work, children, and an overbearing husband, and as she learned to cope with those upsets, her sight slowly returned.</p><p>Patients with paralysis or muscle spasms can also respond well to physiotherapy. &ldquo;They need to learn how to use their legs again,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says. It&rsquo;s often an uphill struggle; particularly with seizures, relapse is common. &ldquo;We have to give ongoing support and reassurance.&rdquo;</p><p>One of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s biggest concerns is the rate of misdiagnosis &ndash; doctors overlooking the psychological origin of these illnesses, instead prescribing the patients drugs, or even admitting them for harmful surgery. She says this may come from the doctors&rsquo; fear; somehow, it seems more serious missing a physical cause of an illness than a psychological cause &ndash; yet the damage can be just as great.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03qb6qy\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;The people who have been told they have epilepsy &ndash; they will be put on a toxic medication for at least a couple of years, before they accept it&rsquo;s not going to work.&rdquo; Over that time, the condition has become a part of the patients&rsquo; life &ndash; they&rsquo;ve told their friends, families, and employer, making it much harder to accept the new diagnosis. &ldquo;You become wedded to it through your own belief and the doctor&rsquo;s belief,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says. &ldquo;You are getting treatment you don&rsquo;t need for a disease you don&rsquo;t have, and you are deprived of the treatment you do need &ndash; you&rsquo;re not referred for CBT, a physiotherapist or a psychiatrist.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps inspired by meeting Yvonne at the start of her career, she would like to raise awareness of psychosomatic illnesses at the earliest stages of a doctor&rsquo;s training. &ldquo;My feeling is that it needs to start at medical school-level,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I must have encountered these patients thousands of times but I have no recollection of being told how I should help them.&rdquo;</p><p>For the time being, she hopes that her book will at least spark that conversation; so far, she has already found that a small number of patients are becoming more accepting of the diagnosis, and are less afraid of the stigma attached to it. &ldquo;I have my fingers crossed that it will be a talking point, that people will feel less ashamed.&rdquo;</p><p>--</p><p><em>David Robson is BBC Future&rsquo;s feature writer.

If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.</p><p>&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.</p><p><strong>Round-the-clock detection</strong></p><p>Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.</p><p>As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.</p><p>Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Black holes and revelations</strong></p><p>However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}</p><p>The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.</p><p>What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.</p><p><strong>Time warp</strong></p><p>The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;</p><p>Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;</p><p>Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}</p><p>After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.</p><p>&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasa’s cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.</p><p>&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\">here</a> &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)</p><p>Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at <a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\">TED2015 in Vancouver</a> last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}</p><p>Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\">handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts</a>. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.</p><p>She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"> bodily motion and visualisation</a> &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\">accent and articulation</a> &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}</p><p>But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.</p><p>Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Infectious giggles</strong></p><p>That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\">to open up about personal information</a> &ndash; paving more common ground between people.</p><p>Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\">laughter correlates with increased pain threshold</a>, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.</p><p>Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}</p><p>For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.</p><p>Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.</p><p>You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\">asking visitors of different ages to judge</a> the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}</p><p>Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.</p><p>Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p>Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.</p><p>&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\">here</a> &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)</p><p>Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at <a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\">TED2015 in Vancouver</a> last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}</p><p>Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\">handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts</a>. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.</p><p>She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"> bodily motion and visualisation</a> &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\">accent and articulation</a> &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}</p><p>But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.</p><p>Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Infectious giggles</strong></p><p>That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\">to open up about personal information</a> &ndash; paving more common ground between people.</p><p>Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\">laughter correlates with increased pain threshold</a>, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.</p><p>Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}</p><p>For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.</p><p>Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.</p><p>You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\">asking visitors of different ages to judge</a> the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}</p><p>Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.</p><p>Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p>Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people.

Like a witch doctor&rsquo;s spell, their words might be spreading modern plagues.</p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it</p></blockquote><p>We have long known that expectations of a malady can be as dangerous as a virus. In the same way that voodoo shamans could harm their victims through the power of suggestion, priming someone to think they are ill can often produce the actual symptoms of a disease. Vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and even death, could be triggered through belief alone. It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;nocebo effect&rdquo;.</p><p>But it is now becoming clear just how easily those dangerous beliefs can spread through gossip and hearsay &ndash; with potent effect. It may be the reason why certain houses seem cursed with illness, and why people living near wind turbines report puzzling outbreaks of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wind-turbine-syndrome-blamed-mysterious-symptoms-cape-cod/story?id=20591168\">dizziness, insomnia and vomiting</a>. If you have ever felt &ldquo;fluey&rdquo; after a vaccination, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/29/electrosensitivity-is-technology-killing-us\">believed your cell phone was giving you a headache</a>, or suffered an inexplicable food allergy, you may have also fallen victim to a nocebo jinx. &ldquo;The nocebo effect shows the brain&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; says Dimos Mitsikostas, from Athens Naval Hospital in Greece. &ldquo;And we cannot fully explain it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A killer joke</strong></p><p>Doctors have long known that beliefs can be deadly &ndash; as demonstrated by a rather nasty student prank that went horribly wrong. The 18th Century Viennese medic, Erich Menninger von Lerchenthal, describes how students at his medical school picked on a much-disliked assistant. Planning to teach him a lesson, they sprung upon him before announcing that he was about to be decapitated. Blindfolding him, they bowed his head onto the chopping block, before dropping a wet cloth on his neck. Convinced it was the kiss of a steel blade, the poor man &ldquo;<a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0091743597902280/1-s2.0-S0091743597902280-main.pdf?_tid=629508a2-ad24-11e4-91aa-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423133431_417644834766d9ed139dcb89374277fb\">died on the spot</a>&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrtf\"}}</p><p>While anecdotes like this abound, modern researchers had mostly focused on the mind&rsquo;s ability to heal, not harm &ndash; the &ldquo;placebo effect&rdquo;, from the Latin for &ldquo;I will please&rdquo;. Every clinical trial now randomly assigns patients to either a real drug, or a placebo in the form of an inert pill. The patient doesn&rsquo;t know which they are taking, and even those taking the inert drug tend to show some improvement &ndash; thanks to their faith in the treatment.</p><p>Yet alongside the benefits, people taking placebos often report puzzling side effects &ndash; nausea, headaches, or pain &ndash; that are unlikely to come from an inert tablet. The problem is that people in a clinical trial are given exactly the same health warnings whether they are taking the real drug or the placebo &ndash; and somehow, the expectation of the symptoms can produce physical manifestations in some placebo takers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it,&rdquo; says Ted Kaptchuk at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqryx\"}}</p><p>Over the last 10 years, doctors have shown that this nocebo effect &ndash; Latin for &ldquo;I will harm&rdquo; &ndash; is very common. Reviewing the literature, Mitsikostas has so far documented strong nocebo effects in many treatments for headache, multiple sclerosis, and depression. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23145482\">trials for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</a>, as many as 65% report adverse events as a result of their placebo. &ldquo;And around one out of 10 treated will drop out of a trial because of nocebo, which is pretty high,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Although many of the side-effects are somewhat subjective &ndash; like nausea or pain &ndash; nocebo responses do occasionally show up as rashes and skin complaints, and they are sometimes detectable on physiological tests too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable &ndash; they are taking sugar pills and when you measure liver enzymes, they are elevated,&rdquo; says Mitsikostas.</p><p>And for those who think these side effects are somehow &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; willed or imagined, measures of nerve activity following nocebo treatment have shown that the spinal cord begins <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/34/13784.long\">responding to heightened pain</a> before conscious deliberation would even be possible.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs10\"}}</p><p>Consider the near fatal case of &ldquo;Mr A&rdquo;, reported by doctor Roy Reeves in 2007. Mr A was suffering from depression when he consumed a whole bottle of pills. Regretting his decision, Mr A rushed to ER, and promptly collapsed at reception. It looked serious; his blood pressure had plummeted, and he was hyperventilating; he was immediately given intravenous fluids. Yet blood tests could find no trace of the drug in his system. Four hours later, another doctor arrived to inform Reeves that the man had been in the placebo arm of a drugs trial; <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834307000114\">he had &ldquo;overdosed&rdquo; on sugar tablets</a>. Upon hearing the news, the relieved Mr A soon recovered.</p><p>We can never know whether the nocebo effect would have actually killed Mr A, though Fabrizio Benedetti at the University of Turin Medical School thinks it is certainly possible. He has scanned subjects&rsquo; brains as they undergo nocebo suggestions, which seems to set off a chain of activation in the hypothalamus, and the pituitary and adrenal glands &ndash; areas that deal with extreme threats to our body. If your fear and belief were strong enough, the resulting cocktail of hormones could be deadly, he says.</p><p><strong>Sick rumours</p><p></strong>The thought that your doctor could inadvertently make you sicker is concerning enough. But more recently, it has become clear just how little is needed to spread the nocebo effect. Even just passing gossip and hearsay can prime your mind for illness with potent effect.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs30\"}}</p><p>Last year, for instance, Benedetti offered to take <a href=\"http://hcpportalco20140430.pfizer.edrupalgardens.com/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/2014_155_5_Nocebo-and-placebo-modulation-of-hypobaric-hypoxia-headache-involves-the-cyclooxygenase-prostaglandins-pathway.pdf\">more than 100 students up the Italian Alps</a> to an altitude of 3000m (9800ft). A few days beforehand, he had told just one of them about a possible consequence &ndash; that the thin air could bring on a migraine. By the day of the trip, he found that the gossip had spread to more than a quarter of the group &ndash; and those who had heard the rumour began to suffer the worst headaches. What&rsquo;s more, a study of their saliva showed an exaggerated response to the low oxygen conditions, including a proliferation of the enzymes that are associated with altitude headache. &ldquo;The brain biochemistry changed in the &lsquo;socially infected&rsquo; individuals,&rdquo; says Benedetti.</p><p>In other words, harmful beliefs, that transmit illness, could be catching. &ldquo;Negative expectations can be communicated to your friends, neighbours, and the like, and they spread very quickly, producing social nocebo effects in a large population of subjects,&rdquo; says Benedetti. Indeed, another study found that simply seeing another patient suffering pain can <a href=\"http://www.pfizerpro.com.co/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/08013%20V154I8-Responding-to-nocebos-through-observation-Social-contagion-of-negative-emotions_1165_1165.pdf\">make a treatment hurt more</a> &ndash; suggesting nocebo could pass from person to person by silent observation. Even more worryingly, you might not need to be <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15959.short\">conscious of those thoughts to be affected</a>; the nocebo can apparently be triggered by subliminal cues.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs5m\"}}</p><p>History is full of mysterious outbreaks that might have arisen in this way. Most famous is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Plague_of_1518\">deadly dancing plague of 1518</a>. Then, in the 1960s, there was the mysterious &ldquo;June Bug&rdquo; epidemic in an American textile factory, which brought about dizziness and vomiting, despite the fact that none of the poisonous insects thought to be responsible could ever be identified. The most chilling was the spate of mysterious deaths within the community of Hmong people who arrived in the US from southeast Asia in the 1980s &ndash; young men, with no existing illness, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/09/the-dark-side-of-the-placebo-effect-when-intense-belief-kills/245065/\">who began dying in their sleep after periods of nightmares and sleep paralysis</a>; experts have speculated that it arose from a strong cultural belief in deadly night spirits. Often, fear of new technology seems to be responsible: in the late 19th Century, early telephone users reported giddiness and wracking pain after using the new contraption, for instance, while Scandinavian workers in the 1980s developed surprising rashes, apparently from their computer monitors.</p><p>Today, the nocebo is perhaps most visible in such controversial disorders as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2014;volume=16;issue=69;spage=116;epage=122;aulast=Rubin\">wind turbine syndrome</a>&rdquo; (sickness and insomnia from wind farms, most common in Canada) and &ldquo;electro-sensitivity&rdquo; &ndash; an allergic reaction to mobile phone signals and wi-fi. Some sufferers even resort to sleeping in metal cocoons to avoid the constant ringing in their ears. Yet dozens of experiments have shown that people are just as likely to report the same symptoms when they are exposed to a sham transmitter that doesn&rsquo;t actually emit any electromagnetic waves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrx1\"}}</p><p>If work on the nocebo tells us anything, it is that we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the distress of their condition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no doubt in my mind &ndash; people are genuinely experiencing physical symptoms,&rdquo; says James Rubin at King&rsquo;s College London. Even the former head of the World Health Organisation was affected: she <a href=\"http://microwavenews.com/short-takes-archive/brundtland-now-using-cell-phone\">banned cell phones in her office</a>, because she thought that they gave her splitting headaches.</p><p>Fears of electro-sensitivity are relatively rare, but there are many other ways a nocebo belief could have taken a hold of your health. Perhaps you suffer from a mysterious food intolerance, for instance. In England, 20% of people claim to be unable to stomach certain foods &ndash; yet hospital tests of the actual digestion suggest that only about a tenth of that number of people have a real problem. The nocebo may also explain why people apparently develop sickness after an inert vaccine, and it may shed light on <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001078241000363X\">the oft-discussed side-effects of the contraceptive pill</a> &ndash; such as depression, headache, and breast pain&ndash; which scientific trails have mostly failed to confirm. Expectation of illness may also lie behind the sickness and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118898/\">eye-strain apparently created by 3D TVs</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrxt\"}}</p><p>What can be done? It is notoriously difficult to neutralise long-held beliefs, but responsible media reporting would at least stem the spread of poisonous rumours. In 2013, Rubin found that simply showing a short video on electro-sensitivity was enough to trigger later symptoms &ndash; and the evidence seems to show that outbreaks of &ldquo;wind turbine syndrome&rdquo; follow local media reports. In other words, the health scares themselves are actually making people ill.</p><p>How about doctors themselves? Rebecca Wells at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina points out that it&rsquo;s a major dilemma for modern medicine. Doctors are obliged to be honest about a drug&rsquo;s side effects &ndash; they need to gain &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; &ndash; but that is a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352765/\">fuzzy concept when the information itself could make someone sicker</a>. &ldquo;There is no hard and fast truth of what a medicine does,&rdquo; Wells says. In the future, she thinks doctors may need to develop new procedures to decide which facts to divulge and the way they frame that information. Due care is crucial in each case &ndash; as Benedetti points out, the contagious nature of the nocebo means that a single person&rsquo;s side-effects could soon spread to a much larger group.</p><p>More positively, education itself may help sap the nocebo effect of its power. Mitsikostas, for instance, tries to explain to his patients that they have to be wary of their own expectations. &ldquo;We have to make the patient understand that it&rsquo;s an internal fear that we both have to try to fight,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The mind-body connection, he says, is something that we can ill afford to ignore, despite our amazing new medical tools. &ldquo;For millennia, medicine was basically placebo &ndash; by using expectation, magicians used the will to heal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is not enough to overcome disease &ndash; but it is indispensable.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"5704c173713ef24330d6f13b"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"5704c176713ef24330d6f3c7"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Science & Environment","Name":"Science & Environment","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Science & Environment"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:45.984509Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"1aa4ccec-87b5-44b8-b5af-c553debaf6f6","Id":"wwfuture/section/science-environment","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:51:20.083392Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/science-environment"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/science-environment","_id":"5704c176713ef24330d6f3d4"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-11T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The contagious thought that could kill you ","HeadlineShort":"The thought that could kill you","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly ‘catch’ such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Option":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":[],"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"gallery","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>It&rsquo;s been just over 45 years since the Apollo Moon landings, and some would have it that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemalone/2010/12/16/why-cant-we-do-big-things-anymore/\">we are failing to build big anymore</a>; that we've since become too fascinated with the small, too impressed by our tablet computers, games consoles, and smartphones that we don't invest in grand, world-changing engineering projects.</p><p>Stand on the bridge of a container ship docked in a mega-port in Korea, however, and it's clear that's just not true. The global supply chain that brings us those tablets and phones, and pretty much everything else from our clothes and food to our toys and souvenirs, is nothing short of a moon shot itself &ndash; a vast, unprecedented engineering solution to a truly astronomical logistics problem. The fact that it's hidden from most people's sight, and that it has become so utterly reliable and efficient to the point of transparency, doesn't make it any less of an achievement of human technical endeavour.</p><p>To find out more about this huge, invisible network, I accompanied a group of architects and designers called the <a href=\"http://www.unknownfieldsdivision.com/mission.html\">Unknown Fields Division</a> for a rare voyage on a container ship between Korea and China. The aim of the trip was to follow the supply chain back to some of the remotest parts of China and the source of our consumer goods &ndash; and what we saw as we travelled through mega-ports and across oceans looked closer to science fiction than reality.</p><p><strong>Early rise</strong></p><p>We're picked up at 9am from our guesthouse in the Korean city of Busan by a local 'ground agent' for the shipping company Maersk, whose ship will be carrying us for the next week. They have at least one of these personnel handlers in every major port in the world, their job being to ensure crew members make their way through each country's unique and complex maze of customs and immigration bureaucracy, and on to their ships on time.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jn9gt\"}}</p><p>If you were asked to name some multi-national corporate brands you could probably reel off half a dozen, from Apple to Coca-Cola, but chances are that Maersk wouldn't spring to mind. Yet the Danish shipping giant is the very definition of a multi-national corporation, with over 25,000 employees, 345 offices in 125 countries, 600 active ships, and more than 2 million containers moved every year. The company is estimated to be responsible for 20% of Denmark's GDP on its own. Maersk might not make any of the things you buy in shops, but it more than likely put a lot of them there.</p><p>As we drive along, Busan's dense mass of high-rise apartment blocks gives way to what will be one of the defining images of the next seven days; the giant cranes that line every major port in the world. Soon we're into the depths of Busan New Port itself, and speeding past endless, towering stacks of shipping containers until we're finally dwarfed by the huge, blue mass of the Maersk Seletar, the 320m- (1,050ft-) long, 80,000 tonne, 9,000 container capacity ship that will be my home for the next seven days.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jnbj6\"}}</p><p>It's not until we get out on to the towering balconies around the ship's bridge and look back at Busan that we're fully able to first comprehend the scale and nature of these Asian mega-ports. It feels like we're being given a rare look into a usually hidden space, a peek at the intricate but city-scaled machinery of global capitalism.</p><p>From that viewpoint &ndash; essentially high above the sea, looking into land &ndash; it's easiest to describe the ports as a sequence of layers. First, towering above and over the ship, are the loading cranes. Vast structures mounted on huge, four-legged frames, they resemble the naked scaffolding of unbuilt skyscrapers, and trigger nostalgic reminders of Saturn V rocket launch towers from the 1960s. Their sheer size makes them the first thing you see when you arrive at any port &ndash; whether from land or sea, and as staggering as they are they don't make their full impact until you see them move.</p><p><strong>Future gaze</strong></p><p>Built on tracks in the surface of the harbour-side, they slide left and right, parallel to the berthed ships, accompanied by a cacophony of warning sounds and robotic safety announcements. Once in port at night I saw one suddenly fire into life next to the ship in a stroboscopic explosion of lights, before it tracked slowly above my high vantage point, bathing me in the orange glow of a dozen small halogen suns. It was an intense experience.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jnb7k\"}}</p><p>The second layer in from the cranes are the trucks; a constant loop of circling, diesel-belching flatbeds. Endlessly, they arrive at the bottom of the vast cranes, seemingly one every minute when the port is at its busiest, stopping in precise locations so the crane drivers can either pluck their containers off their backs and on to the ships, or drop a freshly unloaded container straight on to them, before the trucks instantly pull away and head inland.</p><p>It's a hypnotic, fascinating dance to watch: the cranes lifting containers off the ships, the trucks pulling up in time to catch them as they are elegantly lowered down on steel cables. The complex and precise orchestration behind every move is almost bewildering to comprehend. The ships never unload everything at just one port &ndash; that'd be hugely inefficient for these vast, globe-orbiting warehouses &ndash; so the crane drivers need to know which one to take off and when, just as the truck drivers need to know where to take each one they collect.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jn7df\"}}</p><p>It's the kind of logistical information that it's hard to imagine any one human mind comprehending, and the truth is no single one does &ndash; this is distributed knowledge, managed by Maersk's vast world-spanning computer network and shaped and interpreted by complex, similarly unknowable, algorithms. In a very real sense the crane and truck drivers are little more than elements in a vast robotic system, receiving instructions in their cabs from their computerised managers, following orders on endless cycles until their shift ends.</p><p>Not that there isn't a certain amount of pride in their work, as regimented and alienating as it might seem &ndash; it's not unusual to see the cranes decorated with awards and badges announcing record breaking container shifting performances. At the same time it's also impossible not to be struck by the precariousness of their job security; with so much managed by the network it must surely only be a matter of time before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140818-robot-ships-poised-to-set-sail\">the system evolves enough to remove the human element entirely</a>. In fact, ports like Rotterdam in the Netherlands have already moved to fully automated systems, with driverless trucks and robotic cranes.</p><p><strong>Stacked neighbours</strong></p><p>Layer three, sat behind the cranes and trucks, is the most easily recognisable image from the whole process: the container stacks. From the bridge of the Seletar they look like row upon row of repeating, multicoloured Lego bricks, six units high, each straddled by multiple cranes &ndash; miniature versions of the ship loaders, sliding back and forth on rails. These cranes continually shuffle the position of the containers within the stacks themselves, following the algorithmic wisdom of the network to ensure everything is in the most efficient position possible; cargo heading backwards and forwards, inland and out.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jn9b9\"}}</p><p>At every port we arrived at, the three layers &ndash; cranes, trucks, containers &ndash; seemed fundamentally the same, standardised with only the occasional exception. The Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtRzGCMV9Fg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">small, fast moving, mini cranes</a> instead of trucks &ndash; oddly top-heavy looking skeletal machines that bounce along on huge moon-buggy tyres. They swarm endlessly like busy robots, their blue or yellow frames smeared in grease and grime, discharging black clouds of diesel smog.</p><p>It's only layer four that displays any individualisation &ndash; the landscapes beyond the ports. In Busan it was housing blocks branded with corporation logos nestling beneath green mountains. And at Shanghai's Yangshan Deep Water Port it was the six-lane, 20 mile long Donghai bridge, built to carry the constant flow of container trucks in and out from the port, built on a vast artificial island.</p><p><strong>Dark skies</strong></p><p>After three days at sea, we reach the city of Ningbo. Arriving into port at night we are presented with an almost nightmare vision, a Blade Runner-like landscape of glowing lights and smokestacks painting the low cloud ceiling orange. We'd been delayed going in as the black shadow of a ship owned by French giant CMA CGM slid gently past. It towers above ours, with a startling 18,000 container capacity. As soon as we hit port-side the cranes fired into life, the trucks queuing up as though impatient to make up the delayed time.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jn9rj\"}}</p><p>The next morning, unable to sleep, I rise at 4.30am and head for the top of the ship again, eager to see the port in daylight. The industrial landscape in front of me is vast and awful: a huge coal burning power station fed directly by incoming bulk carrier ships sits right on the port-side, its towers filling the sky with black, while the landscape behind is filled with refineries, gas storage plants, and tightly huddled together housing blocks. You can not only see the pollution &ndash; the vast carbon footprint of this industrial network &ndash; but taste it in the air. As much talk and concern as there is in the West about the environmental impact of China's economic dominance, it's easy to forget how much of that impact the Chinese people are taking as a direct hit themselves, as much for the West&rsquo;s benefit as their own.</p><p>It's not just onshore environments that containerisation has shaped and transformed. The surfaces of our planet's oceans &ndash; for centuries a space of mystery and myth, of expanse and desolation &ndash; have been rationalised and shrunk. Once an enigmatic, awe-inspiring place, the sea has become a zone of efficiency, little more than another channel for the automated supply chain network.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jn84n\"}}</p><p>Over the course of seven days there wasn't a single time when I stood on the bridge of the Seletar, even when deep at sea, that I couldn't look out and see other container ships, and a brief scan of the horizon with binoculars would usually reveal four or five more. The implications are even more startling when nearing a port, and seeing dozens of vast ships held at anchorage, lined up like trucks in a parking lot. The sea has become dominated by GPS tracking and autopiloted navigation, where the shipping routes are more than just vague geographical gestures, but instead precise spaces traced out both by computerised charts and physical markers, with deep sea buoys marking lanes like the painted lines on road surfaces.</p><p><strong>Human shift</strong></p><p>Change the sea and change ships and it's impossible to not also change seafarers, although perhaps the impact containerisation has had on ship crews is a little more subtle. Certainly, like the crane and truck drivers back at the port, there's a certain sense of alienation from the cargo. Nobody on the ship knows what lies inside the containers the ship carries.</p><p>There are exceptions of course; hazardous materials must be declared, as must the contents of the refrigerated containers &ndash; known in the industry as reefers. The reefers themselves are fascinating pieces of technology, basic containers outfitted to be advanced climate controlled, computer monitored micro-environments. Checking the reefers are running is the crew&rsquo;s only tangible, direct responsibility for the cargo beyond ensuring it arrives on time. Even so, it is still highly computer-controlled; the ship&rsquo;s captain, Brian Argent, tells me that the crew's emails piggy-back off a satellite uplink designed keep an eye on the reefers, transmitting status updates thousands of miles back to land so that the company's computers know about a problem before the ship's crew does.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jn9v4\"}}</p><p>And that's not all the ship receives emails about: Maersk regularly sends Argent and his senior officers messages informing him of course changes or of what speed to take. Even the captain has become just another node in the network, the running of his ship dictated by the unseen algorithms.</p><p>The myth of the seafarer as the drunken adventurer with &ldquo;a girl in every port&rdquo; couldn't be further from the truth, with shore leave a rarity, and ports so far from urban centres that day leave excursions become little more than trips to out-of-town shopping malls to stock up on essentials such as shampoo, shower gel, and snacks. But for most of the Seletar's crew &ndash; made up of mainly Indian, Filipino, and Chinese seafarers &ndash; the reasons for going to sea are the same as they ever were: &nbsp;to make money that can be sent home to their wives, children, and parents.</p><p>And even the sense of distance from their families shrunk, thanks to the Seletar&rsquo;s satellite internet access. It's slow and patchy, but it's enough for the crew to maintain daily communication with home &ndash; with most of them spending a sizable chunk of their free time crouching in corridors and stairwells with smartphones and laptops, trying to find the elusive wi-fi signal so they can talk to home, send messages to loved ones, and connect to Facebook.</p><p>It's a fascinating sight at first, and within a few days I find myself doing the exact same thing. I'd initially thought it might be fun &ndash; healthy even &ndash; to truly escape the internet and life back home for a few days. That was before I realised what the Seletar really was, saw how it was just another node in the network, another rationalised point in the global infrastructure, a bridge between the physical and digital. Once I saw that, I knew it was time to abandon my romantic notions of being away at sea, that it was pointless to resist the lure of the network, and found myself squatting in the stairwell between Decks C and D, trying to get reconnected.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</p><p>Read the first instalment in this series, where <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-the-hidden-home-of-christmas\">Tim Maughan and the Unknown Fields group visits the Chinese city of Yiwu, the real home of Christmas</a>.</p><p>This trip was organised and funded by the </em><a href=\"http://www.unknownfieldsdivision.com/\"><em>Unknown Fields Division</em></a><em>, a group of architects, academics and designers at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. </em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-09T23:47:57Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The invisible network that keeps the world running","HeadlineShort":"The network that runs the world","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"One of the world’s most dazzling engineering feats is largely hidden from view.

Sleep should, in theory, be the most natural and effortless activity in the world, yet insomnia is common to many of us. To add to the frustration, it is now becoming clear that the hours you spend in bed are just as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20130726-the-sleep-secrets-of-ceos\">important to your physical and mental health</a> as those spent walking, talking and eating. A good night&rsquo;s rest can help regulate your mood, sharpen your attention, and boost your memory, while ailments from <a href=\"http://cpr.sagepub.com/content/21/1/57.abstract\">heart disease</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768214/\">diabetes</a> have been linked to those struggling to get sufficient sleep.</p><p>Simply willing yourself to fall to sleep can make its sweet relief even more elusive, and we resort to all sorts of measures to help ease our journey to the land of nod. But what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t? BBC Future has reviewed the evidence to find out.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t&hellip; drink caffeine after dark</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rvr\"}}<strong></p><p></strong>Avoiding caffeine is obvious advice, but it's worth repeating. The good news is that you may not need to be as strict as once thought. If you have your last coffee in the early afternoon, most of the caffeine will have been flushed out of your body by 11pm. So although avoiding coffee or tea within <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24235903\">6 hours of going to bed</a> will make it much easier to drop off, it is unclear whether there are any benefits to abstaining outside that time period. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that not everyone is affected by caffeine equally; some people have a gene variant which means they are much less sensitive to caffeine&rsquo;s effects &ndash; so it&rsquo;s worth experimenting with what works for you.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; keep a sleep diary</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rzl\"}}</p><p>Cutting down on alcohol, taking regular exercise, avoiding daytime naps and following a rigid bedtime schedule <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001002\">can also improve your &ldquo;sleep hygiene&rdquo; and set you up for deeper slumbers.</a> And it should go without saying that you should avoid doing anything strenuous or stressful within a few hours of sleep time &ndash; a habit that is easier said than remembered. For this reason, some studies suggest keeping a sleep diary of your activity before bed, which <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23813124\">helps to ensure you avoid the worst triggers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t&hellip; curl up with your favourite reading device</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6s2g\"}}</p><p>Although the act of reading may be soporific, changes in the way we consume literature could be sending your bodily rhythms into disarray. Many e-readers are backlit with blue frequencies of light &ndash; which can fool the brain into thinking that it&rsquo;s still daytime. Perhaps for this reason, a recent study found that reading on these devices for a few hours before bed seems to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535358\">suppress melatonin</a> (the sleep hormone) and therefore makes it harder to doze off, compared to a traditional paperback. The same goes for tablets, MP3 players and smartphones. So if you want to feel refreshed the next day, the bedroom may be the perfect place for an analogue revival.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; try some &ldquo;slumber-foods&rdquo;</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rgj\"}}</p><p>According to the old wives&rsquo; tale, cheese and chocolate before bed will give you nightmares. That remains to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares\">proven scientifically</a>, but your day&rsquo;s meals can certainly influence how quickly you get to sleep, and the quality of your slumbers. Meals high in carbohydrates and protein (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812543\">especially oily fish</a>), but low in fat, show moderate benefits to overall sleep duration and quality, provided they are eaten at least an hour before you plan to drop off. Food rich in tryptophan (an important precursor to several neurotransmitters), and the hormone melatonin, might also help regulate the body clock <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008810/\">to prepare your brain for a more restful night</a>. A recent review, charting the evidence so far, suggests that about 300g of turkey, 200g of pumpkin seeds, or a glass of tart cherry juice, could give you the necessary dose of these compounds &ndash; though hard evidence is lacking.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; sleep in a new position (or learn the didgeridoo)</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6yq0\"}}</p><p>Many restless nights can be linked to sleep apnoea &ndash; a condition linked to snoring, in which the airways becomes constricted when you are unconscious. Often, the sleeper doesn&rsquo;t even realise what has woken them up with a start &ndash; despite the fact that it can happen many times in one night. There are several causes, but some cases may be easily solved by switching from lying on your back, to sleeping on your <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25618193\">front</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24118690\">side</a>. Another, more left-field suggestion is to learn the didgeridoo; perhaps because it strengthens muscles in the respiratory system. A small study in the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7536/266\">British Medical Journal</a> found that learning the instrument gave some sufferers a smoother sleep with fewer interruptions. Certainly not a solution for everyone &ndash; particularly those with close neighbours trying to get some sleep themselves.</p><p>As you may have gathered, there is no fool-proof path to a sleepless night. But by considering the different cocktail of factors that may make you toss and turn in bed, you can at least start to experiment with your habits to see what works for you. It certainly beats counting sheep.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.<br /></em></p><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zsspn39\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j8p7c\"}}</a></p><p><em>BBC iWonder investigates <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zsspn39\">what's stopping your slumber</a>.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20141013-can-you-become-a-morning-person\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j8jgc\"}}</a></p><p><em>Drowsy in the mornings?

After boarding their flight in Canada on the evening of 23 August 2001, newlyweds Margaret McKinnon and her husband were heading for Lisbon, Portugal. As Air Transat flight 236 soared over the mid-Atlantic, McKinnon went to the lavatory. Nothing inside it was working. &ldquo;It seemed odd,&rdquo; she says, but she didn't think a lot of it.</p><p>Returning to her seat, the crew served breakfast, but then announced that they would be making an emergency landing. She remembers thinking it seemed early to be arriving in Lisbon. &ldquo;I didn't really understand at the time what that meant,&rdquo; she says. She soon found out. Crew instructed passengers to put on their life jackets. The lights flickered, then extinguished. The cabin depressurised. Oxygen masks deployed.</p><p>The plane&rsquo;s systems had shut down after a catastrophic leakage of fuel. &ldquo;They were shouting that we would be ditching into the ocean,&rdquo; McKinnon recalls.</p><p>After a half hour of preparing for the worst, McKinnon recalls somebody yelling that they&rsquo;d made it to land. It was the Azores, an isolated archipelago some 850 miles (1,360km) off the Portuguese coast. The pilots had established contact with Lajes, a joint military-civilian air base. Following a harrowing 360 degree spin and several sharp turns to reduce altitude, the crew shouted &ldquo;brace, brace, brace&rdquo; as the officers brought the plane to a bumpy landing. Fires licked across the plane&rsquo;s wheels.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgwj\"}}</p><p>The stunned passengers and crew descended escape slides and ran across a field to a safe distance, towards American soldiers with guns. Two serious and 16 minor injuries were sustained during evacuation down the chutes, but all 293 passengers and 13 crew survived.</p><p>But for many the flight didn&rsquo;t end there. For some &ndash; including McKinnon &ndash; the terrifying experience replayed vividly as intrusive memories and nightmares in the months that followed.</p><p>The experience inspired McKinnon, now a clinical psychologist, to study what trauma does to the brain &ndash; how it changes what we remember and why some people experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In recent years, she and a number of other researchers have been trying to understand what makes fearful experiences seem to become imprinted so deeply in our brains. And if they can understand why trauma has such a profound and lasting effect on us, perhaps they can find ways to help people cope better with the aftermath.</p><p><strong>Fearful imprint</strong></p><p>The link between fear and memory has intrigued researchers and clinicians for decades. Yet the data is conflicting. &ldquo;Some studies have found that during the recollection of traumatic events, recollection is enhanced. It's very vivid, people recall many details, and people don't seem to have difficulty remembering,&rdquo; says McKinnon. Other studies have found that recollection of traumatic events can be very impoverished and fragmented, with &ldquo;a detail here, a detail there, that don't really fit together&rdquo;, she explains.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgp8\"}}</p><p>Few studies have looked at memory during the experience of trauma itself, especially for a single, shared event. So McKinnon decided to delve into the memories of her fellow passengers on Air Transat flight 236.</p><p>&ldquo;We wanted to take this opportunity to look at a very &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; circumstance, so to speak,&rdquo; says McKinnon, suppressing an awkward laugh at using &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; to describe AT 236&rsquo;s emergency descent. McKinnon and collaborators examined the memories for 15 passengers on the flight, comparing their recollection of three events: the flight itself, an emotionally neutral event from the same year, and their experience during 9/11, the following month. Six of those interviewed exhibited PTSD symptoms.</p><p>The researchers guided subjects&rsquo; memories by saying &ldquo;tell me everything you can remember about the event&rdquo;, and then further aided retrieval with cues like &ldquo;what were you thinking, what were you feeling, and what was the lighting like in the cabin?&rdquo; These detailed recollections were compared with the known sequence of events, and a control group who had suffered less traumatic memories.</p><p>What they found was that all passengers, regardless of whether they went on to develop PTSD, had vivid and enhanced recollections of the incident, supporting the idea that fear changes how the brain stores memories. In those that subsequently developed PTSD, &ldquo;they showed a lot of recollection of extraneous details, not only of the traumatic event, but also for the events of September 11, as well as from the neutral memory from the same time period&rdquo;, says McKinnon. It suggests that these individuals have difficulty editing what they recollect, or fading the contents of memory.</p><p>McKinnon admits that her study represents a small sample, and is cautious about generalising the results, but they are nevertheless intriguing. &ldquo;Understandably, people were reluctant to participate,&rdquo; says McKinnon. &ldquo;And we are very, very grateful to the people who did participate, because it can be difficult to talk about these kinds of things.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgvy\"}}</p><p>So if traumatic memories are more vivid, what&rsquo;s going on inside our heads when they are &lsquo;made&rsquo;? There are multiple memory systems in the brain. We have physical memories, like how we learn to ride a bike. We have auditory memories for singing songs. And we have more specific &ldquo;declarative&rdquo; memory systems heavily involving the hippocampus. The hippocampus stores memory for things like where we parked our car, and that two plus two is four.</p><p>But fear activates a different system: our body&rsquo;s emergency control centre &ndash; the <a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_04/d_04_cr/d_04_cr_peu/d_04_cr_peu.html\">amygdala</a>. The amygdala, a pair of almond-shaped structures on the left and right of the brain&rsquo;s medial temporal lobe, is particularly involved in emotional memories like fear, but also in pleasurable memories associated with food, sex, or recreational drug use. When a memory is particularly striking and unexpected, it activates this emotional memory system.</p><p>That may be partly why there are a plethora of anecdotes about how sensory cues, out of context, can take you right back to emotional memories &ndash; perhaps you associate the scent of a certain perfume or cologne with your first kiss because the memory is higher fidelity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgyp\"}}</p><p>With a fearful experience, our survival systems kick into action, and we can achieve what&rsquo;s known as a single trial memory. &ldquo;If you escape from a lion once, or you see someone else being eaten by a lion, you know to be afraid of that lion,&rdquo; explains Kerry Ressler, a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. That's very different from something like studying facts in a book, and activities that aren&rsquo;t emotionally arousing. &ldquo;That may make sense evolutionarily, because we want to prioritise things that are really important,&rdquo; explains Ressler.</p><blockquote><p>The fear system has evolved to keep us alive</p></blockquote><p>When we feel fear, a burst of adrenaline activates a cascade that is thought to enhance memory storage of the immediately preceding events. &ldquo;The fear system has evolved to keep us alive,&rdquo; says Karim Nader, a psychology professor at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.</p><p><strong>Flashbulb memories</p><p></strong>Fearful experiences may not always lay down strong memories, however. Elizabeth Phelps, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, was interested in people&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;flashbulb memories&rdquo; of 9/11. These are not individuals with PTSD, &ldquo;but everyday people who had experienced 9/11, which was most of us&rdquo;, says Phelps. And curiously, she found that, vivid as these memories feel, they were not as strong as people believed &ndash; they could be changed.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgy8\"}}</p><p>Phelps&rsquo; lab at NYU was near the thick of the disaster. In a large-scale detailed survey conducted first within a few weeks of 9/11, then one year, two years, and 10 years later, they found that &ldquo;people were very confident that the details of their memory were correct&rdquo;. Not the detail in terms of the fact that it happened, but where they were, who they were with, how they first heard about it, and what they did afterwards. However, personal recollections of the contextual details often actually changed with time.</p><p>This suggests, says Phelps, that flashbulb memories differ from memories of more neutral events not because the details of the memory are preserved any better, but because we think they are. &ldquo;With highly traumatic events we think we have this incredibly accurate memory,&rdquo; she says. The truth is, many of the details we think are accurate are not. &ldquo;Emotion focuses your attention on a few details, at the expense of a lot of others,&rdquo; explains Phelps.</p><p><strong>Total recall</p><p></strong>So, could this mean that <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/partial-recall\">traumatic memories can be manipulated, even removed</a>? Based on an emerging understanding of the storage and retrieval of memory, we have windows of opportunity for altering the closure of fearful memories in the brain. The time window for dampening the initial locking-in of memories, explains Nader, is on the order of 6 hours. So pharmacological approaches to lessen the strength with which a distressing memory is locked into the brain need to be administered within that short window. Indeed, there is emerging evidence from rodent and human studies that drugs called beta-blockers can achieve a reduction in later PTSD symptoms if administered quickly. &ldquo;The Israeli military now use that,&rdquo; says Nader. But new research is suggesting that even beyond the short window during which memories are saved to the internal hard drive of our brain, they can be retrieved, updated, and toned down.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jchfv\"}}</p><p>Experimenting with rats, Nader reminded animals of a conditioned fearful memory with a musical tone (previously linked to an electric shock), and subsequently administered a beta-blocker. Even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, the fearful freezing response to the memory was gone. Exploring the same approach in a small sample of humans, Nader and colleagues determined that despite an average of 11 years between trauma and experimental intervention, &ldquo;even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, their trauma was down to non-PTSD levels&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s still early days for this method, and studies of its efficacy are ongoing.</p><p>Still, by using what we know about reconsolidation as a potential therapeutic tool, it seems that a subtle form of memory reprogramming is within reach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not changing your knowledge of what happened. We&rsquo;re just changing its association with these fight or flight stress responses that we get&rdquo;, says Phelps. &ldquo;So the notion that we&rsquo;re going to be able to erase your knowledge of what happened &ndash; that&rsquo;s science fiction at this point.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Departure points</p><p></strong>As for McKinnon, she admits that despite her vividly traumatic experience, there are many details she can&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>&ldquo;We were over the top of the island and then the plane veered back over the ocean, which was incredibly scary, because then we thought &lsquo;that was it&rsquo;,&rdquo; says McKinnon, recalling the moment that AT 236 approached the Lajes landing strip. She remembers seeing the tops of houses, and worrying about crashing there and killing other people. But asked if the plane was in darkness during its terrifying descent, McKinnon says, &ldquo;I have to be honest with you &ndash; I entirely don't remember.&rdquo; Nor can she remember whether or not she was sitting beside the window.</p><p>When it comes to terrifying memories, perhaps our brains are selective in what details are stored. The more we learn about how and why, the closer we&rsquo;ll get to lessening the impact of trauma.</p><p>That fated honeymoon flight was an eventful way to begin a marriage. &ldquo;It was quite a start, yes,&rdquo; McKinnon laughs. &ldquo;Unexpected.&rdquo; It proved to be a life-changing year in more than one way: making her aware of the need for research, but also for better care and treatment for PTSD, she says. &ldquo;And that was the direction I wanted to take my career in.&rdquo; McKinnon&rsquo;s experience that day was the start of an unforeseen new personal and scientific journey. As time goes by, the memory may be harder to remember, but the legacy is hard to forget.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"How extreme fear shapes what we remember","HeadlineShort":"How extreme fear shapes the brain","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Many of us will experience a significant trauma in our lives, says Lesley Evans Ogden.

Even if the bugs had names, and you could hear their shells painfully crunching? And would you take a perverse pleasure from blasting an innocent bystander with an excruciating noise?</p><p>These are just some of the tests that Delroy Paulhus uses to understand the &ldquo;dark personalities&rdquo; around us. Essentially, he wants to answer a question we all may have asked: why do some people take pleasure in cruelty? Not just psychopaths and murderers &ndash; but school bullies, internet trolls and even apparently upstanding members of society such as politicians and policemen.</p><p>It is easy, he says, to make quick and simplistic assumptions about these people. &ldquo;We have a tendency to use the halo or devil framing of individuals we meet &ndash; we want to simplify our world into good or bad people,&rdquo; says Paulhus, who is based at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But while Paulhus doesn&rsquo;t excuse cruelty, his approach has been more detached, like a zoologist studying poisonous insects &ndash; allowing him to build a &ldquo;taxonomy&rdquo;, as he calls it, of the different flavours of everyday evil.</p><p><strong>Self-regard</strong></p><p>Paulhus&rsquo;s interest began with narcissists &ndash; the incredibly selfish and vain, who may lash out to protect their own sense of self-worth.&nbsp; Then, a little more than a decade ago, his grad student Kevin Williams suggested that they explore whether these self-absorbed tendencies are linked to two other unpleasant characteristics &ndash; Machiavellianism (the coolly manipulative) and psychopathy (callous insensitivity and immunity to the feelings of others). Together, they found that the three traits were largely independent, though they sometimes coincide, forming a &ldquo;Dark Triad&rdquo; &ndash; a triple whammy of nastiness.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwhgf\"}}</p><p>It is surprising how candid his participants can often be. His questionnaires typically ask the subjects to agree with statements such as &ldquo;I like picking on weaker people&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wise not to tell me your secrets&rdquo;. You would imagine those traits would be too shameful to admit &ndash; but, at least in the laboratory, people open up, and their answers do seem to correlate with real-life bullying, both in adolescence and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911005423\">adulthood</a>. They are also more likely to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913012634\">be unfaithful to their spouses</a> (particularly those with Machiavellian and psychopathic tendencies) and <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/09/cheating-personality.aspx\">to cheat on tests</a>.</p><p>Even so, since Paulhus tends to focus on everyday evil rather than criminal or psychiatric cases, the traits are by no means apparent on the first meeting. &ldquo;They are managing in everyday society, so they have enough control not to get themselves into trouble. But it catches your attention here or there.&rdquo; People who score particularly high on narcissism, for instance, quickly display their tendency to &ldquo;<a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=leadershipfacpub\">over-claim</a>&rdquo; &ndash; one of the strategies that helps them boost their own egos. In some experiments, Paulhus presented them with a made up subject and they quickly confabulated to try to appear like they knew it all &ndash; only to get angry when he challenged them about it. &ldquo;It strikes you that yes, this fits into a package that allows them to live with a distorted positive view of themselves.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Born nasty</strong></p><p>Once Paulhus had begun to open a window on these dark minds, others soon wanted to delve in to answer some basic questions about the human condition. Are people born nasty, for instance? Studies comparing identical and non-identical twins suggest a relatively <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886907003054\">large genetic component for both narcissism and psychopathy</a>, though Machiavellianism seems to be more due to the environment &ndash; you may learn to manipulate from others. Whatever we&rsquo;ve inherited cannot take away our personal responsibility, though. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone is born with psychopathy genes and then nothing can be done about it,&rdquo; says Minna Lyons at the University of Liverpool.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwhfq\"}}</p><p>You only need to look at the anti-heroes of popular culture &ndash; James Bond, Don Draper or Jordan Belfort in the Wolf of Wall Street &ndash; to realise that dark personalities have sex appeal, a finding supported by more scientific studies. Further clues to the benefits might come from another basic human characteristic &ndash; whether you are a morning or evening person. Lyons and her student, Amy Jones found that &ldquo;night owls&rdquo; &ndash; people who stay up late but can&rsquo;t get up in the morning &ndash; tend to score higher on a range of dark triad traits. They are often risk-takers &ndash; one of the characteristics of psychopathy; they are more manipulative &ndash; a Machiavellian trait &ndash; and as narcissists, they tend to be exploitative of other people. That might make sense if you consider our evolution: perhaps dark personalities have more chance to steal, manipulate, and have illicit sexual liaisons late while everyone else is sleeping, so they evolved to be creatures of the night.</p><p>Whatever the truth of that theory, Paulhus agrees there will always be niches for these people to exploit. &ldquo;Human society is so complex that there are different ways of enhancing your reproductive success &ndash; some involve being nice and some being nasty,&rdquo; he says.</p><p><strong>Dark corners</strong></p><p>Recently, he has started probing even further into the darkest shadows of the psyche. &nbsp;&ldquo;We were pushing the envelope, asking more extreme questions,&rdquo; he says &ndash; when he found that some people will also readily admit to inflicting pain on others for no other reason than their own pleasure. Crucially, these tendencies are not simply a reflection of the narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism, but seem to form their own sub-type &ndash; &ldquo;everyday sadism&rdquo;. For this reason, Paulhus now calls it a &ldquo;dark tetrad&rdquo;.</p><p>The &ldquo;<a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/24/11/2201.long\">bug crushing machine</a>&rdquo; offered the perfect way for Paulhus and colleagues to test whether that reflected real life behaviour. Unknown to the participants, the coffee grinder had been adapted to give insects an escape route &ndash; but the machine still produced a devastating crushing sound to mimic their shells hitting the cogs. Some were so squeamish they refused to take part, while others took active enjoyment in the task. &ldquo;They would be willing not just to do something nasty to bugs but to ask for more,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;while others thought it was so gross they didn&rsquo;t even want to be in the same room.&rdquo; Crucially, those individuals also scored very highly on his test for everyday sadism.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwh59\"}}</p><p>Arguably, a rational human being shouldn&rsquo;t care too much about bugs&rsquo; feelings. But the team then set up a computer game that would allow the participants to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; a competitor with a loud noise through their headphones. This wasn&rsquo;t compulsory; in fact, the volunteers had to perform a tedious verbal task to earn the right to punish their competitor &ndash; but, to Paulhus&rsquo;s surprise, the everyday sadists were more than happy to take the trouble. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t just willingness to do it but a motivation to enjoy, to put in some extra effort to have the opportunity to hurt other individuals.&rdquo; Importantly, there was no provocation or personal gain to be had from their cruelty &ndash; the people were doing it for pure pleasure.</p><p><strong>Troll tracking</strong></p><p>He thinks this is directly relevant to internet trolls. &ldquo;They appear to be the internet version of everyday sadists because they spend time searching for people to hurt.&rdquo; Sure enough, an anonymous survey of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000324\">trollish commentators found that they scored highly on dark tetrad traits</a>, but particularly the everyday sadism component &ndash; and enjoyment was their prime motivation. Indeed, the bug-crushing experiment suggested that everyday sadists may have more muted emotional responses to all kinds of pleasurable activities &ndash; so perhaps their random acts of cruelty are attempts to break through the emotional numbness.</p><p>More immediately, his discoveries have attracted the attention of police and military agencies, who want to collaborate with Paulhus to see if his insights might explain why some people abuse their positions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The concern is that these people might deliberately select jobs where you are given the mandate to hurt individuals,&rdquo; he says. If so, further work might suggest ways to screen out the dark personalities at recruitment.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwh8n\"}}</p><p>He&rsquo;s also excited about new work on &ldquo;moral Machiavellianism&rdquo; and &ldquo;communal narcissists&rdquo; &ndash; people who perhaps have dark traits but use them for good (as they see it). In some situations, ruthlessness may be necessary. &ldquo;To be prime minister, you can&rsquo;t be namby pamby &ndash; you need to cut corners and hurt people, and even be nasty to achieve your moral causes,&rdquo; he says. After all, the dark personalities often have the impulse and the confidence to get things done &ndash;even <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html\">Mother Theresa apparently had a steely side</a>, he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to help society by sitting at home being nice.&rdquo;</p><p>All of which underlines the false dichotomy of good and evil that Paulhus has been keen to probe. In a sense, that is a personal as much as a professional question. He admits to seeing a dark streak in his own behaviour: for example, he enjoys watching violent, painful sports like Mixed Martial Arts. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take long to see I would stand above average on these dark traits,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But given my abiding curiosity as a scientist and my enjoyment of investigating such things &ndash; I thought that perhaps I was in a good position to take a closer look at the dark side.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-01-30T09:47:58Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Psychology: the man who studies everyday evil","HeadlineShort":"The man who studies evil","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Why are some people extraordinarily selfish, manipulative, and unkind?

Throughout the interview, Porter&rsquo;s words subtly create a negative impression for the patient. He says he has some &ldquo;bad news&rdquo; and the knees are &ldquo;worn out&rdquo; due to osteoarthritis; the drugs &ldquo;help a bit&rdquo; &ndash; but they may damage the lining of the stomach, he says.</p><p>As Watts goes on to discover, those subtle cues might actually exacerbate the physical symptoms. &ldquo;The problem with the way I sold it, was that it validated your concerns that your knee&rsquo;s falling apart, it&rsquo;s crumbling, you&rsquo;re doomed,&rdquo; says Porter. &ldquo;And the side effects I mentioned &ndash; I put them out of all proportion.&rdquo;</p><p>Experiments have shown that simply warning people about certain side-effects can actually make them more likely to experience the nausea, fatigue, headaches or diarrhoea &ndash; even when they have been assigned innocuous pills rather than an active drug.</p><p><strong>Healing words</strong></p><p>Medicine has long known about the placebo effect &ndash; the healing power of good expectations. But the nocebo effect, as its evil twin is known, may be more powerful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to do harm than good,&rdquo; explains Watts. &ldquo;And this is worrisome, because nocebo&rsquo;s negative influence can be found lurking in almost every aspect of medical life and beyond.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs6n\"}}</a></p><p>In extreme circumstances it could even be deadly, as we recently explored in our article &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death\">The contagious thought that could kill you</a>&rdquo;.<strong> &nbsp;<br /> </strong><br /> The good news is that, through the same power of the mind-body connection, a good bedside manner may do wonders for treatment. One study found that depressed patients given placebo pills by an empathetic doctor <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16503356\">ended up with better results</a> than those taking an active drug from a psychiatrist who seemed less concerned about their welfare. Some scientists have even hypothesised that doctors could try to make use of the placebo effect to reduce the dose given to patients &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699032\">by using the power of their mind to make up the difference</a>. &ldquo;Healing is a real phenomenon. We all have the ability to self-heal in many conditions and that can be activated by our interactions with other people,&rdquo; says Paul Dieppe at Exeter Medical School.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ll8ng\"}}</p><p>Simple measures might include taking an empathetic and caring attitude during diagnosis, that considers the patient&rsquo;s concerns and fears, however unlikely, says Porter. And when prescribing treatments, the doctor should emphasise the positive effects of the medicine, while framing the negative side-effects so they seem less frightening, and being careful not to over-emphasise their risks.</p><p>&ldquo;Every word counts, every glance counts,&rdquo; says Ted Kaptchuk of Harvard University.

In the same way that voodoo shamans could harm their victims through the power of suggestion, priming someone to think they are ill can often produce the actual symptoms of a disease. Vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and even death, could be triggered through belief alone. It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;nocebo effect&rdquo;.</p><p>But it is now becoming clear just how easily those dangerous beliefs can spread through gossip and hearsay &ndash; with potent effect. It may be the reason why certain houses seem cursed with illness, and why people living near wind turbines report puzzling outbreaks of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wind-turbine-syndrome-blamed-mysterious-symptoms-cape-cod/story?id=20591168\">dizziness, insomnia and vomiting</a>.

The 18th Century Viennese medic, Erich Menninger von Lerchenthal, describes how students at his medical school picked on a much-disliked assistant. Planning to teach him a lesson, they sprung upon him before announcing that he was about to be decapitated. Blindfolding him, they bowed his head onto the chopping block, before dropping a wet cloth on his neck. Convinced it was the kiss of a steel blade, the poor man &ldquo;<a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0091743597902280/1-s2.0-S0091743597902280-main.pdf?_tid=629508a2-ad24-11e4-91aa-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423133431_417644834766d9ed139dcb89374277fb\">died on the spot</a>&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrtf\"}}</p><p>While anecdotes like this abound, modern researchers had mostly focused on the mind&rsquo;s ability to heal, not harm &ndash; the &ldquo;placebo effect&rdquo;, from the Latin for &ldquo;I will please&rdquo;. Every clinical trial now randomly assigns patients to either a real drug, or a placebo in the form of an inert pill. The patient doesn&rsquo;t know which they are taking, and even those taking the inert drug tend to show some improvement &ndash; thanks to their faith in the treatment.</p><p>Yet alongside the benefits, people taking placebos often report puzzling side effects &ndash; nausea, headaches, or pain &ndash; that are unlikely to come from an inert tablet. The problem is that people in a clinical trial are given exactly the same health warnings whether they are taking the real drug or the placebo &ndash; and somehow, the expectation of the symptoms can produce physical manifestations in some placebo takers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it,&rdquo; says Ted Kaptchuk at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqryx\"}}</p><p>Over the last 10 years, doctors have shown that this nocebo effect &ndash; Latin for &ldquo;I will harm&rdquo; &ndash; is very common. Reviewing the literature, Mitsikostas has so far documented strong nocebo effects in many treatments for headache, multiple sclerosis, and depression. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23145482\">trials for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</a>, as many as 65% report adverse events as a result of their placebo. &ldquo;And around one out of 10 treated will drop out of a trial because of nocebo, which is pretty high,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Although many of the side-effects are somewhat subjective &ndash; like nausea or pain &ndash; nocebo responses do occasionally show up as rashes and skin complaints, and they are sometimes detectable on physiological tests too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable &ndash; they are taking sugar pills and when you measure liver enzymes, they are elevated,&rdquo; says Mitsikostas.</p><p>And for those who think these side effects are somehow &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; willed or imagined, measures of nerve activity following nocebo treatment have shown that the spinal cord begins <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/34/13784.long\">responding to heightened pain</a> before conscious deliberation would even be possible.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs10\"}}</p><p>Consider the near fatal case of &ldquo;Mr A&rdquo;, reported by doctor Roy Reeves in 2007. Mr A was suffering from depression when he consumed a whole bottle of pills. Regretting his decision, Mr A rushed to ER, and promptly collapsed at reception. It looked serious; his blood pressure had plummeted, and he was hyperventilating; he was immediately given intravenous fluids. Yet blood tests could find no trace of the drug in his system. Four hours later, another doctor arrived to inform Reeves that the man had been in the placebo arm of a drugs trial; <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834307000114\">he had &ldquo;overdosed&rdquo; on sugar tablets</a>. Upon hearing the news, the relieved Mr A soon recovered.</p><p>We can never know whether the nocebo effect would have actually killed Mr A, though Fabrizio Benedetti at the University of Turin Medical School thinks it is certainly possible. He has scanned subjects&rsquo; brains as they undergo nocebo suggestions, which seems to set off a chain of activation in the hypothalamus, and the pituitary and adrenal glands &ndash; areas that deal with extreme threats to our body. If your fear and belief were strong enough, the resulting cocktail of hormones could be deadly, he says.</p><p><strong>Sick rumours</p><p></strong>The thought that your doctor could inadvertently make you sicker is concerning enough. But more recently, it has become clear just how little is needed to spread the nocebo effect. Even just passing gossip and hearsay can prime your mind for illness with potent effect.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs30\"}}</p><p>Last year, for instance, Benedetti offered to take <a href=\"http://hcpportalco20140430.pfizer.edrupalgardens.com/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/2014_155_5_Nocebo-and-placebo-modulation-of-hypobaric-hypoxia-headache-involves-the-cyclooxygenase-prostaglandins-pathway.pdf\">more than 100 students up the Italian Alps</a> to an altitude of 3000m (9800ft). A few days beforehand, he had told just one of them about a possible consequence &ndash; that the thin air could bring on a migraine. By the day of the trip, he found that the gossip had spread to more than a quarter of the group &ndash; and those who had heard the rumour began to suffer the worst headaches. What&rsquo;s more, a study of their saliva showed an exaggerated response to the low oxygen conditions, including a proliferation of the enzymes that are associated with altitude headache. &ldquo;The brain biochemistry changed in the &lsquo;socially infected&rsquo; individuals,&rdquo; says Benedetti.</p><p>In other words, harmful beliefs, that transmit illness, could be catching. &ldquo;Negative expectations can be communicated to your friends, neighbours, and the like, and they spread very quickly, producing social nocebo effects in a large population of subjects,&rdquo; says Benedetti. Indeed, another study found that simply seeing another patient suffering pain can <a href=\"http://www.pfizerpro.com.co/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/08013%20V154I8-Responding-to-nocebos-through-observation-Social-contagion-of-negative-emotions_1165_1165.pdf\">make a treatment hurt more</a> &ndash; suggesting nocebo could pass from person to person by silent observation. Even more worryingly, you might not need to be <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15959.short\">conscious of those thoughts to be affected</a>; the nocebo can apparently be triggered by subliminal cues.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs5m\"}}</p><p>History is full of mysterious outbreaks that might have arisen in this way. Most famous is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Plague_of_1518\">deadly dancing plague of 1518</a>. Then, in the 1960s, there was the mysterious &ldquo;June Bug&rdquo; epidemic in an American textile factory, which brought about dizziness and vomiting, despite the fact that none of the poisonous insects thought to be responsible could ever be identified. The most chilling was the spate of mysterious deaths within the community of Hmong people who arrived in the US from southeast Asia in the 1980s &ndash; young men, with no existing illness, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/09/the-dark-side-of-the-placebo-effect-when-intense-belief-kills/245065/\">who began dying in their sleep after periods of nightmares and sleep paralysis</a>; experts have speculated that it arose from a strong cultural belief in deadly night spirits. Often, fear of new technology seems to be responsible: in the late 19th Century, early telephone users reported giddiness and wracking pain after using the new contraption, for instance, while Scandinavian workers in the 1980s developed surprising rashes, apparently from their computer monitors.</p><p>Today, the nocebo is perhaps most visible in such controversial disorders as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2014;volume=16;issue=69;spage=116;epage=122;aulast=Rubin\">wind turbine syndrome</a>&rdquo; (sickness and insomnia from wind farms, most common in Canada) and &ldquo;electro-sensitivity&rdquo; &ndash; an allergic reaction to mobile phone signals and wi-fi. Some sufferers even resort to sleeping in metal cocoons to avoid the constant ringing in their ears. Yet dozens of experiments have shown that people are just as likely to report the same symptoms when they are exposed to a sham transmitter that doesn&rsquo;t actually emit any electromagnetic waves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrx1\"}}</p><p>If work on the nocebo tells us anything, it is that we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the distress of their condition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no doubt in my mind &ndash; people are genuinely experiencing physical symptoms,&rdquo; says James Rubin at King&rsquo;s College London. Even the former head of the World Health Organisation was affected: she <a href=\"http://microwavenews.com/short-takes-archive/brundtland-now-using-cell-phone\">banned cell phones in her office</a>, because she thought that they gave her splitting headaches.</p><p>Fears of electro-sensitivity are relatively rare, but there are many other ways a nocebo belief could have taken a hold of your health. Perhaps you suffer from a mysterious food intolerance, for instance. In England, 20% of people claim to be unable to stomach certain foods &ndash; yet hospital tests of the actual digestion suggest that only about a tenth of that number of people have a real problem. The nocebo may also explain why people apparently develop sickness after an inert vaccine, and it may shed light on <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001078241000363X\">the oft-discussed side-effects of the contraceptive pill</a> &ndash; such as depression, headache, and breast pain&ndash; which scientific trails have mostly failed to confirm. Expectation of illness may also lie behind the sickness and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118898/\">eye-strain apparently created by 3D TVs</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrxt\"}}</p><p>What can be done? It is notoriously difficult to neutralise long-held beliefs, but responsible media reporting would at least stem the spread of poisonous rumours. In 2013, Rubin found that simply showing a short video on electro-sensitivity was enough to trigger later symptoms &ndash; and the evidence seems to show that outbreaks of &ldquo;wind turbine syndrome&rdquo; follow local media reports. In other words, the health scares themselves are actually making people ill.</p><p>How about doctors themselves? Rebecca Wells at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina points out that it&rsquo;s a major dilemma for modern medicine. Doctors are obliged to be honest about a drug&rsquo;s side effects &ndash; they need to gain &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; &ndash; but that is a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352765/\">fuzzy concept when the information itself could make someone sicker</a>. &ldquo;There is no hard and fast truth of what a medicine does,&rdquo; Wells says. In the future, she thinks doctors may need to develop new procedures to decide which facts to divulge and the way they frame that information. Due care is crucial in each case &ndash; as Benedetti points out, the contagious nature of the nocebo means that a single person&rsquo;s side-effects could soon spread to a much larger group.</p><p>More positively, education itself may help sap the nocebo effect of its power. Mitsikostas, for instance, tries to explain to his patients that they have to be wary of their own expectations. &ldquo;We have to make the patient understand that it&rsquo;s an internal fear that we both have to try to fight,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The mind-body connection, he says, is something that we can ill afford to ignore, despite our amazing new medical tools. &ldquo;For millennia, medicine was basically placebo &ndash; by using expectation, magicians used the will to heal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is not enough to overcome disease &ndash; but it is indispensable.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-11T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The contagious thought that could kill you ","HeadlineShort":"The thought that could kill you","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly ‘catch’ such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Option":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly ‘catch’ such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","SummaryShort":"Deadly if you believe it – and contagious","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-11T02:42:14Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"501b5d72-b021-4ba6-a02e-84fcc597b84f","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-11T02:42:14Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death","_id":"5706fb35713ef24330d96f02"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>It was a case that baffled everyone involved. The 74-year-old woman had initially been troubled by a rash that wouldn&rsquo;t go away. By the time she arrived at the hospital, her lower right leg was covered in waxy lumps, eruptions of angry red and livid purple. Tests confirmed the worst suspicions: it was carcinoma, a form of skin cancer.</p><p>The future looked bleak. Given the spread of the tumours, radiotherapy would not have been effective; nor could the doctors dig the tumours from the skin. Amputation was perhaps the best option, says Alan Irvine, the patient&rsquo;s doctor at St James&rsquo; Hospital, Dublin &ndash; but at her age, she was unlikely to adapt well to a prosthetic limb. After a long and frank discussion, they decided to wait as they weighed up the options. &ldquo;We had a lot of agonising for what to do,&rdquo; says Irvine.</p><p>Then the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; started. Despite receiving no treatment at all, the tumours were shrinking and shrivelling before their eyes. &ldquo;We watched for a period of a few months and the tumours just disappeared,&rdquo; says Irvine. After 20 weeks, <a href=\"http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/qjmed/early/2013/07/30/qjmed.hct162.full.pdf\">the patient was cancer-free</a>. &ldquo;There had been no doubt about her diagnosis,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But now there was nothing in the biopsies, or the scans.&rdquo;</p><p>Somehow, she had healed herself of arguably our most feared disease. &ldquo;Everyone was thrilled, and a bit puzzled,&rdquo; Irvine says, with some understatement. &ldquo;It shows that it is possible for the body to clear cancer &ndash; even if it is incredibly rare.&rdquo;</p><p>The question is, how? Irvine&rsquo;s patient believed it was the hand of God; she had kissed a religious relic just before the healing set in. But scientists are instead looking to the underlying biology of so-called &ldquo;spontaneous regression&rdquo; to hunt for clues that could make these rare cases of self-healing more common. &ldquo;If you can train the body to do this on a broader scale, you could have something that&rsquo;s very widely applicable,&rdquo; says Irvine.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldbfh\"}}</p><p>In theory, our immune system should hunt out and destroy mutated cells before they ever develop into cancer. Occasionally, however, these cells manage to sneak under the radar, reproducing until they grow into a full-blown tumour.</p><p>By the time the cancer has reached the attention of doctors, unaided recovery is highly unlikely: overall, just one in 100,000 cancer patients are thought to shed the disease without treatment.</p><p><strong>Disappearing act</strong></p><p>Within those scant reports, though, there are some truly incredible stories. A hospital in the UK, for instance, recently reported the case of a woman who had experienced long-lasting fertility problems. She then discovered that she had a tumour between her rectum and her uterus, but before doctors could operate, she finally conceived. All went well and a healthy baby was delivered &ndash; only for the doctors to find that the cancer had mysteriously vanished during the pregnancy. <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/crie/2014/481823/\">Nine years later, she shows no sign of relapse</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldbyt\"}}</p><p>Similarly spectacular recoveries have now been recorded in many different kinds of cancer, including extremely aggressive forms like acute myeloid leukaemia, which involves the abnormal growth of white blood cells. &ldquo;If you leave the patient untreated, they usually die within weeks, if not days,&rdquo; says Armin Rashidi at Washington University in St Louis. Yet he has found <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2014.970545\">46 cases in which acute myeloid leukaemia </a>regressed of its own accord, although only eight avoided a relapse in the long term. &ldquo;If you find a random oncologist and ask if this can this happen, 99% would say no &ndash; it makes no sense,&rdquo; says Rashidi, who worked with colleague Stephen Fisher on the paper.</p><p><strong>Agonising wait<br /> </strong><br /> In contrast, dramatic recoveries from a childhood cancer called neuroblastoma are surprisingly frequent &ndash; offering some of the best clues about what might trigger spontaneous remission. This cancer arises from tumours in the nervous system and hormonal glands. If it then spreads, or metastasises, it can lead to nodules on the skin and growths in the liver, with swelling in the abdomen that makes it difficult for the infant to breathe.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldblr\"}}</p><p>Neuroblastoma is very distressing, yet it can sometimes disappear as quickly as it came, even without medical intervention. In fact, for infants less than one year old, regression is so common that doctors <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrclinonc/journal/v11/n12/full/nrclinonc.2014.168.html\">tend to avoid starting chemotherapy</a> immediately, in the hope that the tumour will shrink by itself. &ldquo;I can remember three cases with rather impressive skin metastases and an enlarged liver, but we literally just observed them &ndash; and they did well,&rdquo; says Garrett Brodeur at the Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>The decision to sit and observe can be difficult, though: although the chance to avoid harrowing treatment comes as a relief to some parents, others find inaction and helplessness difficult to stomach. The agony of that period is one of the reasons that Brodeur wants to understand the mechanisms behind the cancer&rsquo;s vanishing act. &ldquo;We want to develop very specific agents that might initiate regression &ndash; so we don&rsquo;t need to wait for nature to run its course or for &lsquo;god&rsquo; to decide,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Vital clues</strong></p><p>So far, Brodeur has some strong leads. For instance, unlike other nerve cells, the cells in neuroblastoma tumours seem to have developed the ability to survive without &ldquo;nerve growth factor&rdquo; (NGF) &ndash; allowing them to flourish in the wrong parts of the body where NGF is absent. Spontaneous remission may be triggered by a natural change in the neuroblastoma tumour cells, perhaps involving the cell receptors that NGF binds to. Whatever the change is, it might mean that the cells can no longer survive without the essential nutrient.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldbrj\"}}</p><p>If so, a drug that targets those receptors could kick-start recovery in other patients. Brodeur says that two drug companies already have some candidates, and he hopes trials will begin soon. &ldquo;It would selectively kill tumour cells that are sensitive to this pathway, so it could spare patients from chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make them sick or their hair fall out, or cause their blood cell count to fall.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Friendly fire</p><p></strong>Unfortunately, unexpected recoveries from other kinds of cancer have been less well studied, perhaps because of their rarity. But there are some clues, and they could come from the pioneering work of a little-known American doctor more than 100 years ago.<strong><br /> </strong><br /> It was the late 19th Century, and William Bradley Coley was struggling to save a patient with a large tumour in his neck. Five operations had failed to eradicate the cancer. Then the patient caught a nasty skin infection with a scorching fever. By the time he&rsquo;d recovered, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623675.700-dr-coleys-famous-fever.html#.VPSR-hDtsmA\">the tumour was gone</a>. Testing the principle on a small number of other patients, Coley found that deliberately infecting them with bacteria, or treating them with toxins harvested from microbes, destroyed otherwise inoperable tumours.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldcxl\"}}</p><p>Could infection be the key to stimulating spontaneous remission more generally? Analyses of the recent evidence certainly make a compelling case for exploring the idea. Rashidi and Fisher&rsquo;s study found that 90% of the patients recovering from leukaemia had suffered another illness such as pneumonia shortly before the cancer disappeared. Other papers have noted tumours vanishing after <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010518214001498\">diphtheria, gonorrhoea, hepatitis, influenza, malaria, measles, smallpox and syphilis</a>. What doesn&rsquo;t kill you really can make you stronger in these strange circumstances.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not the microbes, per se, that bring about the healing; rather, the infection is thought to trigger an immune response that is inhospitable to the tumour. The heat of the fever, for instance, may itself render the tumour cells more vulnerable, and trigger cell suicide. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s significant that when we are fighting bacteria or viruses, our blood is awash with inflammatory molecules that are a call to arms for the body&rsquo;s macrophages, turning these immune cells into warriors that kill and engulf microbes &ndash; and potentially the cancer too. &ldquo;I think the infection changes the innate immune cells from helping the tumours to killing them,&rdquo; says Henrik Schmidt at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark. That, in turn, may also stimulate other parts of the immune system &ndash; such as our dendritic cells and T-cells &ndash; to learn to recognise the tumorous cells, so that they can attack the cancer again should it return.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldcww\"}}</p><p>Schmidt thinks that understanding the process of spontaneous remission is vital, since it could help refine the emerging class of &ldquo;immunotherapies&rdquo; that hijack our natural defences to combat cancer. In one treatment, for instance, doctors inject some cancer patients with inflammatory &ldquo;cytokines&rdquo; in order to kick the immune system into action. The side effects &ndash; such as high fever and flu-like symptoms &ndash; are typically treated with drugs like paracetamol, to improve the patient&rsquo;s comfort.</p><p>But given that the fever itself may trigger remission, Schmidt suspected that the paracetamol might sap the treatment&rsquo;s potency. Sure enough, he has found that more than twice as many patients &ndash; <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-014-1637-5/fulltext.html\">25% versus 10%</a> &ndash; survive past the two-year follow-up, if they were instead left to weather the fever.</p><p>There could be many other simple but powerful steps to improve cancer treatment inspired by these insights. One man experienced <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671034/\">spontaneous remission after a tetanus and diphtheria vaccination</a>, for instance &ndash; perhaps because vaccines also act as a call to arms for the immune system. Along these lines, Rashidi points out that a receiving standard vaccine booster &ndash; such as the BCG jab against tuberculosis &ndash; seems to reduce the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673674900701\">chance of melanoma relapse after chemotherapy</a>.</p><p><strong>Catching a cure<br /> </strong><br />Others are considering a far more radical line of attack. For instance, one approach aims to <a href=\"http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/13/1/3\">deliberately infect cancer patients with a tropical disease</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldbnj\"}}</p><p>The technique, developed by American start-up PrimeVax, involves a two-pronged approach. It would begin by taking a sample of the tumour, and collecting dendritic cells from the patient&rsquo;s blood. These cells help coordinate the immune system&rsquo;s response to a threat, and by exposing them to the tumour in the lab, it is possible to programme them to recognise the cancerous cells. Meanwhile, the patient is given a dose of dengue fever, a disease normally carried by mosquitoes, before they are injected with the newly trained dendritic cells.</p><p>Under the supervision of doctors in a hospital, the patient would begin to develop a 40.5C fever, combined with the widespread release of inflammatory molecules &ndash; putting the rest of the immune system on red alert. Where the tumour was once able to lurk under the radar, it should now become a prime target for an intense attack from the immune cells, led by the programmed dendritic cells. &ldquo;Dengue fever crashes and regroups the immune system, so that it is reset to kill tumour cells,&rdquo; says Bruce Lyday at PrimeVax.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ldcw8\"}}</p><p>Infecting vulnerable patients with a tropical illness may sound foolhardy, but dengue fever is less likely to kill the average adult than the common cold &ndash; making it the safest choice of infection. Importantly, once the fever has subsided, the programmed immune cells will remain on the lookout for the tumour, should it reappear. &ldquo;Cancer is a moving target. Most therapies attack from just one side &ndash; but we&rsquo;re trying to put it in a lose-lose situation, now and in the future,&rdquo; says Lyday.</p><p>No one could fault the ambition behind this kind of therapy. &ldquo;Our mission is to replicate spontaneous remission in as standardised way as possible,&rdquo; says Lyday&rsquo;s colleague Tony Chen. Even so, they are keen to emphasise that their idea is still at a very early stage of development &ndash; and they cannot know how it will play out until they begin a clinical trial. The first tests, they hope, will begin with advanced melanoma patients, perhaps by the end of the year.</p><p>Clearly, caution is necessary. As Irvine points out: &ldquo;Spontaneous remission is a little clue in a big complicated jigsaw.&rdquo; But if &ndash; and that is a massive if &ndash; they succeed, the implications would be staggering. A rapid, relatively painless recovery from cancer is now considered a miracle. The dream is that it might just become the norm.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p>Just one in 100,000 cancer patients shed the disease &ndash; but why?</p></blockquote>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-06T10:05:20Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Cancer: The mysterious miracle cases inspiring doctors","HeadlineShort":"Mystery of the vanishing cancer","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"A few patients have made rare and unexpected recoveries leaving doctors scratching their heads, says David Robson.

Sleep should, in theory, be the most natural and effortless activity in the world, yet insomnia is common to many of us. To add to the frustration, it is now becoming clear that the hours you spend in bed are just as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20130726-the-sleep-secrets-of-ceos\">important to your physical and mental health</a> as those spent walking, talking and eating. A good night&rsquo;s rest can help regulate your mood, sharpen your attention, and boost your memory, while ailments from <a href=\"http://cpr.sagepub.com/content/21/1/57.abstract\">heart disease</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768214/\">diabetes</a> have been linked to those struggling to get sufficient sleep.</p><p>Simply willing yourself to fall to sleep can make its sweet relief even more elusive, and we resort to all sorts of measures to help ease our journey to the land of nod. But what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t? BBC Future has reviewed the evidence to find out.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t&hellip; drink caffeine after dark</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rvr\"}}<strong></p><p></strong>Avoiding caffeine is obvious advice, but it's worth repeating. The good news is that you may not need to be as strict as once thought. If you have your last coffee in the early afternoon, most of the caffeine will have been flushed out of your body by 11pm. So although avoiding coffee or tea within <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24235903\">6 hours of going to bed</a> will make it much easier to drop off, it is unclear whether there are any benefits to abstaining outside that time period. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that not everyone is affected by caffeine equally; some people have a gene variant which means they are much less sensitive to caffeine&rsquo;s effects &ndash; so it&rsquo;s worth experimenting with what works for you.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; keep a sleep diary</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rzl\"}}</p><p>Cutting down on alcohol, taking regular exercise, avoiding daytime naps and following a rigid bedtime schedule <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001002\">can also improve your &ldquo;sleep hygiene&rdquo; and set you up for deeper slumbers.</a> And it should go without saying that you should avoid doing anything strenuous or stressful within a few hours of sleep time &ndash; a habit that is easier said than remembered. For this reason, some studies suggest keeping a sleep diary of your activity before bed, which <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23813124\">helps to ensure you avoid the worst triggers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t&hellip; curl up with your favourite reading device</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6s2g\"}}</p><p>Although the act of reading may be soporific, changes in the way we consume literature could be sending your bodily rhythms into disarray. Many e-readers are backlit with blue frequencies of light &ndash; which can fool the brain into thinking that it&rsquo;s still daytime. Perhaps for this reason, a recent study found that reading on these devices for a few hours before bed seems to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535358\">suppress melatonin</a> (the sleep hormone) and therefore makes it harder to doze off, compared to a traditional paperback. The same goes for tablets, MP3 players and smartphones. So if you want to feel refreshed the next day, the bedroom may be the perfect place for an analogue revival.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; try some &ldquo;slumber-foods&rdquo;</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rgj\"}}</p><p>According to the old wives&rsquo; tale, cheese and chocolate before bed will give you nightmares. That remains to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares\">proven scientifically</a>, but your day&rsquo;s meals can certainly influence how quickly you get to sleep, and the quality of your slumbers. Meals high in carbohydrates and protein (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812543\">especially oily fish</a>), but low in fat, show moderate benefits to overall sleep duration and quality, provided they are eaten at least an hour before you plan to drop off. Food rich in tryptophan (an important precursor to several neurotransmitters), and the hormone melatonin, might also help regulate the body clock <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008810/\">to prepare your brain for a more restful night</a>. A recent review, charting the evidence so far, suggests that about 300g of turkey, 200g of pumpkin seeds, or a glass of tart cherry juice, could give you the necessary dose of these compounds &ndash; though hard evidence is lacking.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; sleep in a new position (or learn the didgeridoo)</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6yq0\"}}</p><p>Many restless nights can be linked to sleep apnoea &ndash; a condition linked to snoring, in which the airways becomes constricted when you are unconscious. Often, the sleeper doesn&rsquo;t even realise what has woken them up with a start &ndash; despite the fact that it can happen many times in one night. There are several causes, but some cases may be easily solved by switching from lying on your back, to sleeping on your <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25618193\">front</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24118690\">side</a>. Another, more left-field suggestion is to learn the didgeridoo; perhaps because it strengthens muscles in the respiratory system. A small study in the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7536/266\">British Medical Journal</a> found that learning the instrument gave some sufferers a smoother sleep with fewer interruptions. Certainly not a solution for everyone &ndash; particularly those with close neighbours trying to get some sleep themselves.</p><p>As you may have gathered, there is no fool-proof path to a sleepless night. But by considering the different cocktail of factors that may make you toss and turn in bed, you can at least start to experiment with your habits to see what works for you. It certainly beats counting sheep.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.<br /></em></p><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zsspn39\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j8p7c\"}}</a></p><p><em>BBC iWonder investigates <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zsspn39\">what's stopping your slumber</a>.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20141013-can-you-become-a-morning-person\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j8jgc\"}}</a></p><p><em>Drowsy in the mornings?

It was the beating of his &ldquo;second heart&rdquo;.</p><p>The small mechanical pump was meant to relieve the burden of his failing cardiac muscles, but Carlos (not his real name) disliked the sensation. The beat of the machine seemed to replace his pulse, a sensation that warped his body image: as the device throbbed above his navel, Carlos had the eerie feeling that his chest had dropped into the abdomen.</p><p>It was a strange, unsettling feeling. But when neuroscientist Agustin Ibanez met Carlos, he suspected even odder effects were to come. By changing the man&rsquo;s heart, Ibanez thought, the doctors might have also changed their patient&rsquo;s mind: Carlos would now think, feel and act differently as a result of the implant.</p><p>How come? We often talk about &ldquo;following the heart&rdquo;, but it is only recently that scientists have begun to show that there is literal truth in the cliche; the heaving lump of muscle contributes to our emotions and the mysterious feelings of &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in a very real way. Everything from your empathy for another person&rsquo;s pain to the hunch that your spouse is having an affair may originate from subtle signals in your heart and the rest of your body.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887813\">the man who feels two hearts</a> offered Ibanez, who is based at Favaloro University in Buenos Aires, a unique opportunity to test those ideas.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Cranial stuffing&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ibanez&rsquo;s work chimes with millennia of speculation about the heart&rsquo;s role in cognition &ndash; which was sometimes thought to supersede the brain&rsquo;s. Touching the cool, moist grey matter of the cortex, for instance, <a href=\"http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/1880/47541/1/Reynolds_2007.pdf\">Aristotle assumed that the brain&rsquo;s main function was to chill the passions erupting from the heart</a> &ndash; which he considered the seat of the soul. For similar reasons, embalmers in ancient Egyptians made sure to leave the heart in the chest, but happily removed the mere &ldquo;cranial stuffing&rdquo; from the head.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhfl\"}}</p><p>We now take a more cerebral view of thought, even if the view of the heart as the font of our emotions has lingered; just consider the many metaphors we use to describe feelings today. William James, the founder of modern psychology, helped formalise these ideas in the 19th Century by suggesting that emotions are really a back-and-forth feedback cycle between the body and the brain. According to his theory, the brain might be able to register a threat intellectually &ndash; but it is our awareness of the racing heartbeat and sweaty palms that transforms an abstract concept into a visceral emotion.</p><p>James&rsquo; ideas also raised an important question: if everybody has different bodily awareness, would that shape the emotions they experience? The idea was difficult to test, however, but a hundred years later scientists are now on the case.</p><p>The studies first asked subjects to count their heartbeats based solely on the feelings within their chest; they weren&rsquo;t allowed to put their hand on their heart or actively take their pulse. Try it for yourself, and you&rsquo;ll see that this kind of &ldquo;interoception&rdquo; can be surprisingly difficult; around one in four people miss the mark by about 50%, suggesting they have little to no perception of the movements inside them; only a quarter get 80% accuracy. After testing their cardiac awareness, the researchers then gave the volunteers various cognitive tests.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhqz\"}}</p><p>James, it turned out, was spot on. People with more bodily awareness tend have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16729289\">more intense reactions to emotive pictures</a> and report being more greatly moved by them; they are also better at describing their feelings. Importantly, this sensitivity seems to extend to others&rsquo; feelings &ndash; they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559130\">are better at recognising emotions in others&rsquo; faces</a> &ndash; and they are also quicker to learn to avoid a threat, such as a small electric shock in the lab, perhaps because those more intense bodily feelings saturate their memories, making the aversion more visceral. &ldquo;It may quickly clue us in to the relative goodness or badness of the objects, choices, or avenues of action that we are facing,&rdquo; says Daniella Furman at the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, people who are in tune with their bodies have a richer, more vivid emotional life &ndash; including both the ups and downs of life. &ldquo;We may not be able to describe the particular physiological signature of a pleasurable experience, but we would probably recognise the sensations when they occur,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Emotional barometer</strong></p><p>These <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106893\">secret bodily signals may also lie behind our intuition</a> &ndash; the indefinable hunches that you have the winning hand in poker, say, according to an elegant study by Barney Dunn at the University of Exeter. The task was simple: the volunteers were asked to choose cards from four decks, and they would win money if it matched the colour of another, upturned card.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhbg\"}}</p><p>The game was rigged so that you were slightly more likely to win from two of the decks, and lose if you picked from the other two. Dunn found that the people who could track their heartbeat with the most accuracy would tend to pick from certain decks, whereas those with poor interoception were more likely to choose at random.&nbsp;</p><p>The bodily-aware people weren&rsquo;t always correct &ndash; they were the worst losers as well as the best winners &ndash; but the point was that they were more likely to follow their hunches.</p><p>So the folklore may be right: people who are in touch with their heart are more likely to be swayed by their instincts &ndash; for good or bad. All of which prompted Ibanez to wonder what would happen when you are fitted with an artificial heart? If Carlos experienced substantial changes, it would offer important new evidence that our mind extends well beyond the brain.</p><p>And that is exactly what he found. When Carlos tapped out his pulse, for instance, he followed the machine&rsquo;s rhythms rather than his own heartbeat. The fact that this also changed other perceptions of his body &ndash; seeming to expand the size of his chest, for instance &ndash; is perhaps to be expected; in some ways, changing the position of the heart was creating a sensation not unlike the famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/visualized-heartbeat-out-of-body-experience/28728/\">rubber hand illusion</a>&rdquo;. But crucially, it also seemed to have markedly altered certain social and emotional skills. Carlos seemed to lack empathy when he viewed pictures of people having a painful accident, for instance. He also had more general problems with his ability to read other&rsquo;s motives, and, crucially, intuitive decision making &ndash; all of which is in line with the idea that the body rules emotional cognition. &ldquo;It is a very interesting, very intriguing study,&rdquo; says Dunn of the findings.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A lifeless shell&rdquo;</p><p></strong></p><p>Sadly, Carlos died from complications during later treatments &ndash; but Ibanez now hopes to continue his studies with other patients. He is currently performing tests on people undergoing a full heart transplant to see how it could influence interoception. Damage to the vagal nerve should cut off some of the internal signals sent from the heart to the brain, which might then impact their cognition.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhd7\"}}</p><p>Away from the cardiac clinic, he is also looking at whether a fault in the link between body and brain could lead to strange depersonalisation disorders, in which patients have the eerie feeling that they don&rsquo;t inhabit their own body. &ldquo;I feel as though I'm not alive, as though my body is an empty, lifeless shell,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1025389031000138538\">one patient told researchers</a>. &ldquo;I seem to be walking in a world I recognise but don't feel.&rdquo; Ibanez has found that they tend to show worse interoception, and brain scans suggest that this results from a breakdown in communication across the anterior insula &ndash; a deep fold of the cortex that is, tellingly, implicated in <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098769\">body awareness, emotion perception, empathy, decision making &ndash; and the sense of self</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dunn, who is a clinical psychologist, is more concerned about its relevance to depression. &ldquo;At the moment therapy is very much in the head &ndash; we change what the client thinks and trust that their emotions will follow up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I often hit a wall: they say that they know these things intellectually, but emotionally they can&rsquo;t feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Even after therapy has trained more positive thinking, the patient may still struggle to feel joy, for example &ndash; a problem that Dunn suspects may come from poor interoception. He gives the example that when you are walking around the park, your body might give you all sorts of pleasant feedback that shows you are relaxed and peaceful. &ldquo;But depressed clients seem to walk around the park without being engaged with the sensory experience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and then they come back and say it was flat and empty&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkj1d\"}}</p><p>Along these lines, Furman has found that people with major depressive disorder (but without other complications like anxiety) struggle to feel their own heart beat; and the poorer their awareness, the less likely they were to report positive experiences in their daily life. And as Dunn&rsquo;s work on decision making would have suggested, poor body perception also seemed to be linked to measures of indecision &ndash; a problem that blights many people with depression. Furman stresses, however, that there may be many different kinds of depression, and poor bodily awareness may only influence some of them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clear why some people may have reduced bodily awareness, but Dunn thinks it can be trained, with practice. He is currently looking into the use of mindfulness-based therapy, which encourages people to focus on the sensations in their body. He says the challenge is to try to recognise the feelings, even if they are unpleasant, without reacting to them in a knee-jerk way. You should then be better equipped to use the body as the &ldquo;emotional barometer&rdquo; to inform you about your state of mind and decide how to act. Another group has <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038304\">designed a rudimentary computer game</a> that asks you to tap a key with every four heartbeats, and flashes red when you are wrong, offering feedback that should boost body awareness.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? You can enjoy a richer, more emotional life; tune into the sensory pleasures of the world, and make better decisions. And all you have to do is listen to your heart.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141205-the-man-with-two-hearts&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2d%2Fkh%2Fp02dkh7c.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Share this story on Facebook</em></a><em>, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The mind-bending effects of feeling two hearts ","HeadlineShort":"The man with two hearts","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"When a man was fitted with a new heart, his mind changed in unusual ways.

With Samuel Tisherman, at the University of Maryland, College Park, he has shown that it&rsquo;s possible to keep bodies in &lsquo;suspended animation&rsquo; for hours at a time. The procedure, so far tested on animals, is about as radical as any medical procedure comes: it involves draining the body of its blood and cooling it more than 20C below normal body temperature.</p><p>Once the injury is fixed, blood is pumped once again through the veins, and the body is slowly warmed back up. &ldquo;As the blood is pumped in, the body turns pink right away,&rdquo; says Rhee. At a certain temperature, the heart flickers into life of its own accord. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite curious, at 30C the heart will beat once, as if out of nowhere, then again &ndash; then as it gets even warmer it picks up all by itself.&rdquo; Astonishingly, the animals in their experiments show very few ill-effects once they&rsquo;ve woken up. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be groggy for a little bit but back to normal the day after,&rdquo; says Tisherman.</p><p>Tisherman created headlines around the world earlier this year, when he announced that they were ready to begin human trials of the technique on gunshot victims in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The first patients will have been so badly wounded that their hearts have stopped beating, meaning that this is their last hope. &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/23/tech/innovation/suspended-animation-trials/\">Cheating death with &lsquo;suspended animation&rsquo;</a>&rdquo; is how CNN put it; &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/health/a-chilling-medical-trial.html?_r=0\">Killing a patient to save his life</a>&rdquo; was the New York Times&rsquo; take.</p><p><strong>Hyped up</strong></p><p>The news coverage has sometimes offended Tisherman&rsquo;s cautious sensibility. During our conversation, he comes across as a thoughtful, measured man, who is careful not to oversell his research. He is particularly wary of using the term &lsquo;suspended animation&rsquo;. &ldquo;My concern isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s inaccurate &ndash; it&rsquo;s that when people think of the term, they think about space travellers being frozen and woken up on Jupiter, or Han Solo in Star Wars,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t help, because it&rsquo;s important for the public to know it&rsquo;s not science fiction &ndash; it&rsquo;s based on experimental work and is being studied in a disciplined manner, before we use it to stop people dying.&rdquo; Rhee, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/us/13rhee.html\">who came to global attention after treating congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords after a shooting in 2011</a>, tends to be bolder: he says he wouldn&rsquo;t rule out longer-term suspended animation, in the distant future. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing is beginning part of that experiment.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02256xd\"}}</p><p>Tisherman&rsquo;s quest to bring people back from the brink of death began at medical school, where he studied under Peter Safar. It is an inspiring dynasty: in the 1960s Safar had pioneered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the now familiar procedure of applying pressure to the chest cavity to try to massage the heart back to life.</p><p>Safar&rsquo;s work began to change our perceptions of death &ndash; blurring the point that is meant to mark the end of our lives. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been brought up to think death is an absolute moment &ndash; when you die you can&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo; says Sam Parnia, at the State University of New York in Stony Brook. &ldquo;It used to be correct, but now with the basic discovery of CPR we&rsquo;ve come to understand that the cells inside your body don&rsquo;t become irreversibly &lsquo;dead&rsquo; for hours after you&rsquo;ve &lsquo;died&rsquo;&hellip; Even after you&rsquo;ve become a cadaver, you&rsquo;re still retrievable.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Blurred line</strong></p><p>Tisherman now thinks of death as the (admittedly subjective) point at which doctors give up resuscitation as a lost cause &ndash; but even then, some people can still make a remarkable comeback. Last December, a paper in the journal Resuscitation caused a stir by suggesting that 50% of surveyed emergency doctors have witnessed &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994804\">Lazarus phenomena</a>&rsquo;, in which a patient&rsquo;s heart has begun beating again by itself, after doctors had given up hope.</p><p>Kick-starting the heart is only one half of the doctor&rsquo;s battle, however; the lack of oxygen after a cardiac arrest can cause serious damage to the body&rsquo;s vital organs, particularly the brain. &ldquo;Every minute that there&rsquo;s no oxygen to those organs, they start dying,&rdquo; says Tisherman. His former mentor, Safar, came up with a solution to this problem too, with &lsquo;therapeutic hypothermia&rsquo;, a procedure that involves cooling the body, typically to around 33C by placing ice packs around the body, for instance. At lower temperatures, cells begin to work in slow motion, reducing their metabolism and the damage that could be caused by oxygen starvation. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02256t6\"}}</p><p>Combined with machines that can take over circulation and pump oxygen into the blood stream while the heart is being revived, this has helped open the window between cardiac arrest and brain death. One hospital in Texas recently reported that an <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004494/#__ffn_sectitle\">40-year-old man had survived, with his mind intact, after three-and-a-half hours</a> of CPR. His treatment involved a constant rotation of medical students, nurses and doctors taking it in turns to perform the chest compressions. &nbsp;&ldquo;Anybody in the room who had two arms was asked to jump in,&rdquo; says one of the attending doctors, Scott Taylor Bassett. Such cases are rare, however: Bassett, points out that they were only motivated to continue because the patient regained consciousness during the CPR, despite the fact that his heart was still not functioning. &ldquo;During the chest compressions he would speak to us, showing he was neurologically intact,&rdquo; says Bassett. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen it before or since &ndash; it was the defining moment of the entire decision making.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Buying time</strong></p><p>Such long-term resuscitation is currently impossible for people whose cardiac arrest is accompanied by injury from trauma &ndash; such as gunshot wounds or automobile accidents.&nbsp; At the moment, the surgeon&rsquo;s best option is to clamp the arteries leading to the lower body, before opening the chest and massaging the heart, which pushes a little blood flow to the brain while surgeons try to stitch up the wounds. Unfortunately, the survival rate is less than one in 10.</p><p>It is for this reason that Tisherman wants to plunge the body to around 10-15C, potentially giving the doctors a window of two or more hours to operate. Although this level of deep hypothermia is sometimes applied during heart surgery, Tisherman&rsquo;s project is the first time that it will have been be used to revive someone who had already &lsquo;died&rsquo; before entering the hospital. Perhaps most astonishing of all, the team drain the blood from the body and replace it with chilled saline solution. Because the body&rsquo;s metabolism has stopped, the blood is not required to keep cells alive, and saline solution is the quickest way to cool the patient, explains Tisherman.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02256vm\"}}</p><p>With Rhee and others, Tisherman has spent two decades building a substantial portfolio of evidence to prove that the procedure is safe, and effective. Many of the experiments involved pigs inflicted with near-fatal injuries. Mid-operation, there was no doubt that animals were about as far beyond the realms of the living as it is possible to go and then return. &ldquo;The pig is as white as you can get,&rdquo; says Rhee. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just pale, refrigerator meat.&rdquo; If the animals had been cooled quickly enough, however &ndash; at around 2C a minute &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15580018\">nearly 90% recovered</a> when their blood was returned to their bodies, after having lain in limbo for more than an hour. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most amazing thing to witness &ndash; when the heartbeat comes back,&rdquo; says Rhee.</p><p>Once the animals had returned back to more regular activity, the team then performed several tests to check that their brains hadn&rsquo;t been damaged. For instance, before the procedure, the researchers trained some of the pigs to open a container of a certain colour, where an apple was hidden inside. After they had been revived, most of the animals remembered where to fetch their treat. Other pigs that hadn&rsquo;t been trained before the operation, were instead taught the procedure soon after their recovery. They managed to learn just as quickly as the others &ndash; again suggesting that there had been no effect on their memories.</p><p>Needless to say, gaining approval for human trials has been a struggle. Earlier this year, Tisherman was finally allowed to set up a pilot trial in Pittsburgh to treat patients suffering from gunshot wounds. The hospital sees about one or two such patients a month, meaning that some have already been treated with the technique since the trial began &ndash; although it is too early for Tisherman to speak about the results yet. He is also setting up a trial in Baltimore, Maryland, and all being well, Rhee will later be able to begin work at Tuscon&rsquo;s trauma centre.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02256vy\"}}</p><p>As with any medical research, there will be some challenges in the transition from the animal experiments to the human trials. The animals received their own blood at the end of the operation, for instance &ndash; whereas the patients in this trial will need transfusions that have been sitting in blood banks for weeks. And while the animals were under anaesthesia at the time of injury, the patients won&rsquo;t have been, which could change the way their body reacts to the injury. Tisherman remains optimistic, however. &ldquo;We generally think that dogs and pigs respond to bleeding in a similar way to humans.&rdquo;</p><p>Other doctors are watching with interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very brave,&rdquo; says Parnia. &ldquo;Many of us feel that in order to preserve the brain, we have to cool the body a lot more than we&rsquo;ve done traditionally. But people have been afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>If the trials go according to plan, Tisherman would like to extend the approach to other kinds of trauma. Gunshot victims were chosen for the initial trial because it is easier to localise the source of blood loss, but he hopes eventually to treat internal bleeding from an automobile accident, for instance. It may even, one day, be used to treat people suffering from heart attacks and other kinds of illness.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02256sd\"}}</p><p>Success could also pave the way for investigations into other forms of suspended animation. Some scientists are looking into whether a cocktail of drugs added to the saline solution pumped into body could further reduce the body&rsquo;s metabolism and prevent injury. One promising candidate was hydrogen sulphide &ndash; the chemical that gives rotten eggs their smell &ndash; but although it has been found to reduce the metabolism of some animals, there is little evidence that it improves their chances of survival after a cardiac arrest. Tisherman instead thinks it will be better to find some potent anti-oxidants that can mop up the harmful chemicals that cause injury.&nbsp;</p><p>For Rhee, the need for better treatment is all too urgent. He points out the fate of a patient he saw at the hospital only the day before we spoke. &ldquo;He was shot in the epigastrium, right under the chest in the middle of the belly,&rdquo; he says. The hospital staff tried everything they could, but he still died. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly the kind of patient we hope we could repair if we&rsquo;d been able to work in a less rushed fashion.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>This article is part of a series on &ldquo;Comebacks&rdquo;.

As much as we would like to cling on to our past, even the most poignant moments can be washed away with time.</p><p>Ask Nima Veiseh what he was doing for any day in the past 15 years, however, and he will give you the minutiae of the weather, what he was wearing, or even what side of the train he was sitting on his journey to work.</p><p>&ldquo;My memory is like a library of VHS tapes, walk-throughs of every day of my life from waking to sleeping,&rdquo; he explains.</p><p>Veiseh can even put a date on when those reels started recording: 15 December 2000, when he met his first girlfriend at his best friend&rsquo;s 16th birthday party. He had always had a good memory, but the thrill of young love seems to have shifted a gear in his mind: from now on, he would start recording his whole life in detail. &ldquo;I could tell you everything about every day after that.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> My memory is like a library of VHS tapes, walk-throughs of everyday of my life from waking to sleeping &ndash; Nima Veiseh </p></blockquote><p>Needless to say, people like Veiseh are of great interest to neuroscientists hoping to understand the way the brain records our lives. Quick explanations &ndash; such as the possibility that it may be associated with autism &ndash; have proven to be unfounded, but a couple of recent papers have finally opened a window on these people&rsquo;s extraordinary minds. And this research might even suggest ways for us all to relive our past with greater clarity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gk31l\"}}</p><p>&lsquo;Highly superior autobiographical memory&rsquo; (or HSAM for short), first came to light in the early 2000s, with a&nbsp;young woman named Jill Price. Emailing the neuroscientist and memory researcher Jim McGaugh one day, she claimed that she could recall every day of her life since the age of 12. Could he help explain her experiences?</p><p>Intrigued, McGaugh invited her to his lab, and began to test her: he would give her a date and ask her to tell him about the world events on that day. True to her word, she was correct almost every time.</p><p>Luckily, Price had also kept a diary throughout that period, allowing the researchers to verify her recollections of personal incidents too; again, she was right the vast majority of the time. After a few years of these sporadic studies, they decided to give her a further, spontaneous test: &ldquo;Name the dates of every single time you&rsquo;ve visited our lab&rdquo;. In an instant, she reeled off a list of their appointments. &ldquo;None of us was able to recall this list,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.psych.ufl.edu/~fischler/Hm/Parker06_MemorySavant.pdf\">McGaugh and his colleagues noted</a><span>,</span> but comparing her account with their own records, they found that she was absolutely accurate.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2009/03/ff-perfectmemory/\"><span>magazines</span></a> and <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/fisherw1/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/OVHW3350/autobiographical\"><span>documentary film-makers</span></a> to cotton on to her &ldquo;total recall&rdquo;, and thanks to the subsequent media interest, a few dozen other subjects (including Veiseh) have since come forward and contacted the team at the University of California, Irvine. During one of his visits, Veiseh&rsquo;s memory proved to be so accurate that he even found himself correcting the scientists&rsquo; test about the exact date that Michael Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p><blockquote><p> Sometimes I don&rsquo;t remember what happened five minutes ago, but I can remember a detail from 22 January 2008 &ndash; Bill, who has HSAM </p></blockquote><p>Intriguingly, their memories are highly self-centred: although they can remember &ldquo;autobiographical&rdquo; life events in extraordinary detail, they seem to be no better than average at recalling impersonal information, such as random lists of words. Nor are they necessarily better at remembering a round of drinks, say. &ldquo;Sometimes I don&rsquo;t remember what happened five minutes ago, but I can remember a detail from 22 January 2008,&rdquo; explains &ldquo;Bill&rdquo;, who asked us not to use his full name to avoid unwanted attention. And although their memories are vast, they are susceptible to some of the mistakes we all make: in 2013, Lawrence Patihis (now at the University of Southern Mississippi) and colleagues found that people with <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20947.short\">HSAM still suffer from &ldquo;false memories&rdquo;.</a> They can be primed to remember world events that never actually occurred, for instance.</p><p>Clearly, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; memory &ndash; their extraordinary minds are still using the same flawed tools that the rest of us rely on. The question is, how?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gk3fl\"}}</p><p>Some clues come from observing the way their memories evolve over time. Craig Stark at the University of California, Irvine recently <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02017/full?utm_source=Email_to_authors_&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&amp;utm_campaign=Email_publication&amp;field=&amp;journalName=Frontiers_in_Psychology&amp;id=172904\"><span>questioned HSAM subjects</span></a> one week, one month and one year after events in their life to see how their memories of events change over time. He thought, for instance, that HSAM subjects begin at a richer starting point, encoding more details as soon as an event has occurred. In reality, the differences only emerged months down the line: whereas for the other subjects, they had become faded and vague, for the HSAM subjects the events were still just as fresh. &ldquo;It must be something about the way they hold on to the information that the rest of us aren&rsquo;t doing,&rdquo; Stark says.</p><p>Disappointingly, brain scans have failed to reveal any huge anatomical differences that might explain how this occurs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like they had some extra lobe or a &lsquo;third&rsquo; hemisphere of the brain,&rdquo; says Stark. True, they could spot some signature characteristics, such as&nbsp;additional wiring between the frontal lobes (involved in analytical thought) and the seahorse-shaped hippocampus towards the&nbsp;side of the skull, an area&nbsp;thought to be our memory's \"printing press\". But it was perfectly possible that this was the result of their skills, and not the cause: after all, practising any skill, be it music, sport, or a language, can lead the brain to build more efficient neural networks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chicken or egg kind of thing,&rdquo; says Stark.</p><blockquote><p> They scored particular highly on &lsquo;fantasy proneness&rsquo; and &lsquo;absorption&rsquo; </p></blockquote><p>Instead, the key seems to lie in more general thinking patterns and habits. Patihis recently profiled around 20 people with HSAM and found that they scored particularly highly on two measures: <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/15281391/Patihis_L._in_press_._Individual_differences_and_correlates_of_highly_superior_autobiographical_memory\">fantasy proneness and absorption</a>. Fantasy proneness could be considered a tendency to imagine and daydream, whereas absorption is the tendency to allow your mind to become immersed in an activity &ndash; to pay complete attention to the sensations and the experiences. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely sensitive to sounds, smells and visual detail,&rdquo; explains Nicole Donohue, who has taken part in many of these studies. &ldquo;I definitely feel things more strongly than the average person.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Unknown triggers</strong></p><p>The absorption helps them to establish strong foundations for a recollection, says Patihis, and the fantasy proneness means that they revisit those memories again and again in the coming weeks and months. Each time this initial memory trace is &ldquo;replayed&rdquo;, it becomes even stronger.</p><p>In some ways, you probably go through that process after a big event like your wedding day &ndash; but the difference is that thanks to their other psychological tendencies, the HSAM subjects are doing it day in, day out, for the whole of their lives.</p><p>Not everyone with a tendency to fantasise will develop HSAM, though, so Patihis suggests that something must have caused them to think so much about their past &ndash; as opposed to films or aeroplanes, say. &ldquo;Maybe some experience in their childhood meant that they became obsessed with calendars and what happened to them,&rdquo; says Patihis. The subjects themselves find it hard to put their finger on the trigger, however; Veiseh, for instance, knows that his HSAM began with meeting his first girlfriend, but he still can&rsquo;t explain why she set it off.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gk4d5\"}}</p><p>Given these findings, could we all train ourselves to think and remember like Veiseh, Donohue or Bill? Stark is intrigued by the idea. Some of his colleagues are hoping to launch an app that may encourage the active, detailed rehearsal seen in the HSAM subjects, to see if it improves later recollection. There&rsquo;s already some evidence that this may be effective: one recent study found that simply replaying an event in your head for a few seconds, immediately after it had happened, led to stronger recall a week later. (Read BBC Future&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151111-improve-your-memory-in-40-seconds\">Improve your memory in 40 seconds</a>&rdquo;.)</p><p>In reality, Stark compares it to exercise: the idea of a super memory might be nice in theory but harder to put in practice. &ldquo;Look, many of us could also have fit, athletic bodies. There are great motivations &ndash; yet few of us do it.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Imagine being able to remember every painting, on every wall, in every gallery space, between nearly 40 countries &ndash; Nima Veiseh </p></blockquote><p>The people with HSAM I&rsquo;ve interviewed would certainly agree that it can be a mixed blessing. On the plus side, it allows you to relive the most transformative and enriching experiences. Veiseh, for instance, is something of a polymath. He travelled a lot in his youth to compete in international&nbsp;taekwondo competitions, but in his spare time, he&nbsp;visited the local art galleries, and&nbsp;perhaps because his love of art is entwined with his identity, the paintings are&nbsp;now lodged deep in his autobiographical memories.</p><p>&ldquo;Imagine being able to remember every painting, on every wall, in every gallery space, between nearly 40 countries,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That's a big education in art by itself.&rdquo;&nbsp;With this&nbsp;encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of art, he has since&nbsp;become a professional painter, under the&nbsp;moniker \"<a href=\"http://www.enigmaofnewyork.com/\">Enigma of Newyork</a>\". Similarly, his memory may have also aided his other career as a doctoral researcher in design and technology, he thinks, by helping him to absorb a vast body of knowledge.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gk4np\"}}</p><p>Donohue, now a history teacher, agrees that it helped during certain parts of her education: &ldquo;I can definitely remember what I learned on certain days at school. I could imagine what the&nbsp;teacher was saying or what it looked like in the book.&rdquo;</p><p>Not everyone with HSAM has experienced these benefits, however; Price &ldquo;hated&rdquo; school and as a result, seemed not to be able to access the information she had learned. Clearly, the information still has to be personally important for it to stick.</p><blockquote><p> It can be very hard to forget embarrassing moments. You can&rsquo;t turn that stream of memories off, no matter how hard you try &ndash; Nicole Donohue </p></blockquote><p>Viewing the past in high definition can also make it very difficult to get over pain and regret. &ldquo;It can be very hard to forget embarrassing moments,&rdquo; says Donohue. &ldquo;You feel same emotions &ndash; it is just as raw, just as fresh&hellip; You can&rsquo;t turn off that stream of memories, no matter how hard you try.&rdquo; Veiseh agrees: &ldquo;It is like having these open wounds &ndash; they are just a part of you,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>This means they often have to make a special effort to lay the past to rest; Bill, for instance, often gets painful &ldquo;flashbacks&rdquo;, in which unwanted memories intrude into his consciousness, but overall he has chosen to see it as the best way of avoiding repeating the same mistakes. &ldquo;Some people are absorbed in the past but not open to new memories, but that&rsquo;s not the case for me. I look forward to the each day and experiencing something new.&rdquo;</p><p>Veiseh even thinks his condition has made him a kinder, more tolerant person. &ldquo;Some say &lsquo;forgive and forget&rsquo;, but since forgetting is a&nbsp;luxury&nbsp;I don't have, I need to learn to genuinely forgive,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Not just others, but myself as well.&rdquo;</p><p>--</p><p><em><span>David Robson is BBC Future&rsquo;s feature writer.

An elegant 53-year-old with striking red hair who enjoyed wearing a tuxedo at every possible occasion, he tried to present himself with the poise of the film stars he admired. But while on the ship&rsquo;s dance floor one evening, he was embarrassed to find that his shirt had become drenched in sweat.</p><p>Concerned, he examined himself in a mirror, only to find that his pupils had shrunk to two tiny black pinpricks. It was the same glassy-eyed stare that had afflicted his father and two sisters at the beginning of their mysterious illnesses.</p><p>He knew this was just the beginning. Tremors, impotence and constipation could follow. But the most terrifying symptom would be the disappearance of sleep &ndash; almost total insomnia for months; a kind of waking coma that ultimately would end in death.</p><blockquote><p> He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stop sleeping, and within eight or nine months, I&rsquo;ll be dead </p></blockquote><p>Silvano eventually referred himself to the University of Bologna&rsquo;s sleep unit for further study, but he was under no illusions about the course of the disease. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stop sleeping, and within eight or nine months, I&rsquo;ll be dead,&rsquo;&rdquo; one of his doctors, Pietro Cortelli, told me in a phone interview.</p><p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;how can you be sure?&rsquo; He then drew me his genealogical tree from the 18th Century, all by heart.&rdquo; In each generation, Silvano could name family members who had succumbed to the same fate.</p><p>As Silvano had predicted, he died less than a couple of years later, but he left his brain to science in the hope that it might shed some light on the strange disorder that had plagued his family.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03ftq9b\"}}</p><p>What&rsquo;s going on inside the brains and bodies of people with this strange disease? It&rsquo;s a mystery that researchers are only now starting to fully understand, and possibly treat with a promising new drug. However, since &ldquo;Fatal Familial Insomnia&rdquo; (FFI) involves a genetic legacy that is passed through generations, this research is also raising a difficult and ethically fraught question: if your family&rsquo;s genes meant you could one day be struck down by the inability to sleep, would you want to be told your fate?</p><p><strong>Patient zero</strong></p><p>Silvano&rsquo;s family have mostly remained silent about their struggle with FFI, but about 15 years ago they opened up about their history to the writer DT Max, whose book The Family Who Couldn&rsquo;t Sleep offers an engrossing portrait of a family living in fear of their own genes. Hunting for &ldquo;patient zero&rdquo;, Max found the disease could be traced as far back as a Venetian doctor who fell into a continuous, paralysed torpor during the late 18th Century. Soon after, a nephew named Giuseppe succumbed to a similar fate, and from there, the illness passed through his sons Angelo and Vincenzo to their children and great grandchildren, until it reached Silvano&rsquo;s father Pietro, who died during World War Two.</p><p>Despite this chain of losses, the family tried not to talk about the illness for fear of tempting fate, but that changed in the 1980s when Silvano started developing his symptoms. His niece had married a doctor named Ignazio Roiter, and as a man of science, he persuaded his wife&rsquo;s uncle to visit Elio Lugaresi&rsquo;s famous sleep clinic at the University of Bologna, where Cortelli was working.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03ftr02\"}}</p><p>Together, they set about solving the mystery of the illness. Although their efforts could do nothing to save Silvano or two other family members who would succumb shortly afterwards, extensive testing eventually found the culprit: a misshapen protein in the brain called a prion, caused by a tiny genetic mutation. For some reason it is only at middle age that the prions begin to proliferate wildly, collecting in pockets that poison the neurons.</p><blockquote><p> The size and shape of a walnut, in Silvano&rsquo;s brain the thalamus appeared to have been riddled with boring worms </p></blockquote><p>This made it a relative of Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob disease (CJD) and Mad Cow Disease &ndash; two other prion diseases that were garnering serious scientific interest at the time. But whereas CJD <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/illpres/brain.html\">leaves the surface of the brain looking like Swiss cheese</a>, Silvano&rsquo;s condition seems to target parts of the thalamus, at the very centre of the skull. Normally the size and shape of a walnut, the thalamus in Silvano&rsquo;s brain appeared to have been riddled with boring worms.</p><p>After years of further research, the scientists can now explain why damage to this small nub of neural tissue unleashes such a puzzling constellation of symptoms. We know, for instance, that this hub orchestrates all our &ldquo;autonomic&rdquo; responses to the environment &ndash; things like temperature control, blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of hormones to keep the body ticking over comfortably. When it breaks down, it is as if your central heating is going haywire, your water pipes have sprung a leak, your windows are wide open and your loudspeakers are blaring at full volume &ndash; everything is in chaos. Hence the profuse sweating and shrunken pupils, the impotence and the constipation.</p><p><strong>Turning off consciousness</strong></p><p>This erratic autonomic control could also contribute to the patients&rsquo; insomnia: their bodies can&rsquo;t prepare for a night&rsquo;s sleep. Where blood pressure typically drops before sleep, theirs would be abnormally high, for instance, giving the sensation that their body is still on high alert. &ldquo;If the sympathetic nervous system is unbalanced, of course you&rsquo;ve got insomnia,&rdquo; says Cortelli, who presented his ideas in a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079215000751\">recent issue of Sleep Medicine Reviews</a>.</p><blockquote><p> The closest they get to normal sleep is a kind of mindless stupor &ndash; not quite asleep, but not quite aware </p></blockquote><p>Compounding these issues, the brain&rsquo;s rhythms are now in complete disarray. During the night, we normally experience periodic cycles of &ldquo;rapid eye movement&rdquo; punctuated by a deeper &ldquo;slow wave&rdquo; sleep. During this stage, low-frequency oscillations of electrical activity ripple across the cortex &ndash; the gnarled, bark-like tissue on the surface of the brain. This appears to calm down the buzz of coordinated conscious activity you&rsquo;d normally see when we are awake, while also performing important maintenance work, such as consolidating our memories. And what nub of neural tissue deep in the brain orchestrates those delicate rhythms? The thalamus. Lacking this dimmer switch, the FFI patients are always switched on and can never descend into deep, restorative sleep, says Angelo Gemignani at the University of Pisa, who has <a href=\"http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457%2812%2900170-0/abstract\">demonstrated</a> that people with FFI are missing this important pattern of brain activity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03ftr73\"}}</p><p>Without those slow waves, the closest they get to normal sleep is a kind of mindless stupor &ndash; not quite asleep, but not quite aware, in which they mindlessly mime their routine daily activities. Cortelli thinks this is a pale remnant of the REM stage that punctuates the deeper stages of sleep; in some ways, it looks like they are acting out dreams. He remembers a woman, Teresa, who would mindlessly mimic the action of combing someone&rsquo;s hair; she had been a hairdresser before the disease struck.</p><p><strong>Slowed decline </strong></p><p>One remarkable patient, however, has hinted that there may be some unusual ways to alleviate the misery. A psychologist at Touro College in New York, Joyce Schenkein first came across Daniel not through her work, but through a radio chat line (a precursor to internet forums in the 1990s). &ldquo;His profile was very clever &ndash; he was a brilliant guy, extremely funny,&rdquo; she says; they ended up having a long-distance friendship. (Daniel&rsquo;s name has been changed to preserve his family&rsquo;s privacy.)</p><blockquote><p> Daniel&rsquo;s response was to buy a motorhome and travel across the US - he wasn&rsquo;t just going to sit there and die </p></blockquote><p>In a conversation a few years later, he started to sound confused and vague. &ldquo;At some point, he said &lsquo;pardon me if I sound incoherent but I haven&rsquo;t slept for five days,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Schenkein. Medical tests revealed he was carrying the FFI mutation. (His mother had apparently known there was some illness in his father&rsquo;s family, but had decided not to worry her son with the details.) Worse still, it was the form that should progress most rapidly.</p><p>Rather than crumbling into despair, his response was to buy a motorhome and travel across the US. &ldquo;He was an adventurous spirit &ndash; he wasn&rsquo;t just going to sit there and die,&rdquo; Schenkein says. As the symptoms became more extreme, he employed a driver, and then a nurse, to take over the steering wheel when he was too unwell, she says.</p><blockquote><p> Floating in the egg-like shell, he found the rest that had proven so elusive, enjoying a blissful four and a half hours of sleep </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile (and sometimes with Schenkein&rsquo;s advice) Daniel was determined to try as many potential treatments as possible, ranging from vitamin supplements and exercise to improve his general fitness to anaesthetics such as ketamine and nitrous oxide, and sleep medicines like diazepam &ndash; anything that would give him a few winks of sleep, even for as short as 15 minutes at a time. He even bought a sensory deprivation tank, having found that even under an anaesthetic, his fragile slumbers could be interrupted by the slightest sound or movement.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03ftrnq\"}}</p><p>Floating in the egg-shaped cocoon while bathed in warm salt water, he found the rest that had proven so elusive, enjoying a blissful four-and-a half hours of solid sleep. Once he awoke, however, he had to face terrifying hallucinations &ndash; including a strange uncertainty as to whether he was alive or dead.</p><blockquote><p> He even tried electroconvulsive therapy to see if the sharp electric shock could knock him out </p></blockquote><p>Despite these (relative) successes, Daniel still faced regular relapses that became more intense as the disease progressed. &ldquo;When the symptoms reared themselves, he couldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; says Schenkein. &ldquo;There were times when he lost the whole day &ndash; it takes over your consciousness. He could sit there without the initiative to move; he&rsquo;d be frozen in time.&rdquo; Once, he tried electroconvulsive therapy to see if the sharp electric shock could knock him out; it did, but he suffered such bad amnesia afterwards that it seemed a far from ideal solution. After a few years of this struggle, he too finally passed away.</p><p><strong>Clearing the debris</strong></p><p>Although none of the treatments provided long-term relief, Daniel lived years longer than his diagnosis might have predicted. Schenkein points to recent evidence showing that slow-wave sleep triggers currents of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880190/\">cerebrospinal fluid to wash through the channels between brain cells</a>, carrying away the debris and detritus from the day&rsquo;s activity, and leaving it clean like the beach after high tide. Perhaps, by alleviating the insomnia, you can encourage this clean-up and forestall the brain&rsquo;s further disintegration. Together with the Italian neurologist <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3072495/\">Pasquale Montagna (who had worked on those other cases of fatal familial insomnia),</a> Schenkein wrote up the case study for a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17406189\">medical journal</a> in the hope it may inspire others to look for measures to extend the life of patients with FFI.</p><p>&ldquo;It at least opens the possibility to say that there is something we can do,&rdquo; says Cortelli &ndash; though he emphasises that we can only learn so much from a single case report; it is unclear if similar measures would help any other sufferers.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03ftrfl\"}}</p><p>The Venetian family&rsquo;s hopes lie in a different direction. Lugaresi passed away at the end of December last year after decades of working with people with FFI, but Roiter and his colleagues at Milan and Treviso believe they may finally be close to the cure they had all dreamed of. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996399\">Last year, they announced a clinical trial of a new drug</a>, which, they hope, may prevent (or at least decelerate) the formation of the poisonous prions.</p><p>The drug in question, doxycycline, had previously shown some promise in experiments investigating CJD; originally an antibiotic, it seemed to stop the prions sticking together in clumps and encouraged their <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526008005335\">breakup through the brain&rsquo;s natural enzymes</a>. Indeed, in a small clinical trial on people showing early signs of the disease, the 21 people taking the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526008005335\">drug lived about twice as long</a> (an average of 13 months) as the 78 control subjects.</p><blockquote><p> The problem was that many family members did not want to know the results of the test: the fear would cloud the rest of their lives </p></blockquote><p>Disappointingly, a later study that tested the drug on patients already showing more aggressive symptoms of CJD <a href=\"http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/86/7/705.extract\">failed to find a benefit</a>. Roiter and his colleagues wonder if by that point, it might simply be too late to be of use. For this reason, they want to see if doxycycline may still function as a preventative treatment in people at risk of FFI, before the prions have started to amass. &ldquo;It might delay or completely disrupt the development of the disease,&rdquo; says Gianluigi Forloni at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, who is helping to lead the project.</p><p>Setting up a reliable trial, while remaining sensitive to the family&rsquo;s anxieties, involved some knotty considerations. First, the scientists had to genetically test each member to see who was carrying the mutation, and so should be given the active drug. From these, they selected 10 members aged 42 to 52 who might be expected to decline within the next decade.</p><p><strong>Fear of knowledge</strong></p><p>The problem was that many of the family members did not want to know the results of the test: even with the hope of the drug, the fear would cloud every waking minute of their lives. For this reason, a further 15 members who are not at risk of the disease will also receive a sham treatment. This means that each member should have no way of figuring out the results of their test: as far as they can tell, there is less than a 50:50 chance of proving positive or not.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03fts6x\"}}</p><p>Without treatment, Forloni predicts that at least four of the 10 subjects carrying the mutation would be expected to succumb within the next decade. So if the team find that more than six have escaped the disease by the end of that period, they will consider the trial a success &ndash; perhaps justifying more widespread use.</p><p>Despite the glimmer of hope it offers, the trial remains controversial among some of the doctors who have been following this family closely. Cortelli, for one, has decided not to be involved in the project because he is concerned about its ethics. Some of the side effects of the antibiotics may still give away the subjects&rsquo; diagnosis, causing unnecessary distress, he thinks. (In their defence, Roiter and Forloni&rsquo;s team will be providing psychological support throughout the experiment.) In any case, he is sceptical that the evidence for the drug&rsquo;s potential is not strong enough to justify such an extended period of treatment.</p><p>And even if the family members have escaped the disease at the end of the trial, Cortelli says we can&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that these few individuals were simply lucky; some people with the mutation have still lived into their 80s, although no one knows why their gene remained dormant.</p><p>But with anxiety and uncertainty plaguing them whatever they decide, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why the family is willing to take a gamble on the treatment: here is a chance to absolve the death sentence that has been written in their DNA for centuries.</p><p>Silvano&rsquo;s niece once spoke of creeping into her mother&rsquo;s room each night to check that she was really asleep and not hiding the first signs of insomnia. She was, she said, a &ldquo;spy in her own home&rdquo;. If the drug really does work, it would be the end of this living nightmare &ndash; the start of a future in which the solace of a night&rsquo;s sleep can be embraced without fearing it could soon be the last.</p><p><em>David Robson is BBC Future&rsquo;s feature writer.

It was the beating of his &ldquo;second heart&rdquo;.</p><p>The small mechanical pump was meant to relieve the burden of his failing cardiac muscles, but Carlos (not his real name) disliked the sensation. The beat of the machine seemed to replace his pulse, a sensation that warped his body image: as the device throbbed above his navel, Carlos had the eerie feeling that his chest had dropped into the abdomen.</p><p>It was a strange, unsettling feeling. But when neuroscientist Agustin Ibanez met Carlos, he suspected even odder effects were to come. By changing the man&rsquo;s heart, Ibanez thought, the doctors might have also changed their patient&rsquo;s mind: Carlos would now think, feel and act differently as a result of the implant.</p><p>How come? We often talk about &ldquo;following the heart&rdquo;, but it is only recently that scientists have begun to show that there is literal truth in the cliche; the heaving lump of muscle contributes to our emotions and the mysterious feelings of &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in a very real way. Everything from your empathy for another person&rsquo;s pain to the hunch that your spouse is having an affair may originate from subtle signals in your heart and the rest of your body.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887813\">the man who feels two hearts</a> offered Ibanez, who is based at Favaloro University in Buenos Aires, a unique opportunity to test those ideas.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Cranial stuffing&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ibanez&rsquo;s work chimes with millennia of speculation about the heart&rsquo;s role in cognition &ndash; which was sometimes thought to supersede the brain&rsquo;s. Touching the cool, moist grey matter of the cortex, for instance, <a href=\"http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/1880/47541/1/Reynolds_2007.pdf\">Aristotle assumed that the brain&rsquo;s main function was to chill the passions erupting from the heart</a> &ndash; which he considered the seat of the soul. For similar reasons, embalmers in ancient Egyptians made sure to leave the heart in the chest, but happily removed the mere &ldquo;cranial stuffing&rdquo; from the head.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhfl\"}}</p><p>We now take a more cerebral view of thought, even if the view of the heart as the font of our emotions has lingered; just consider the many metaphors we use to describe feelings today. William James, the founder of modern psychology, helped formalise these ideas in the 19th Century by suggesting that emotions are really a back-and-forth feedback cycle between the body and the brain. According to his theory, the brain might be able to register a threat intellectually &ndash; but it is our awareness of the racing heartbeat and sweaty palms that transforms an abstract concept into a visceral emotion.</p><p>James&rsquo; ideas also raised an important question: if everybody has different bodily awareness, would that shape the emotions they experience? The idea was difficult to test, however, but a hundred years later scientists are now on the case.</p><p>The studies first asked subjects to count their heartbeats based solely on the feelings within their chest; they weren&rsquo;t allowed to put their hand on their heart or actively take their pulse. Try it for yourself, and you&rsquo;ll see that this kind of &ldquo;interoception&rdquo; can be surprisingly difficult; around one in four people miss the mark by about 50%, suggesting they have little to no perception of the movements inside them; only a quarter get 80% accuracy. After testing their cardiac awareness, the researchers then gave the volunteers various cognitive tests.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhqz\"}}</p><p>James, it turned out, was spot on. People with more bodily awareness tend have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16729289\">more intense reactions to emotive pictures</a> and report being more greatly moved by them; they are also better at describing their feelings. Importantly, this sensitivity seems to extend to others&rsquo; feelings &ndash; they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559130\">are better at recognising emotions in others&rsquo; faces</a> &ndash; and they are also quicker to learn to avoid a threat, such as a small electric shock in the lab, perhaps because those more intense bodily feelings saturate their memories, making the aversion more visceral. &ldquo;It may quickly clue us in to the relative goodness or badness of the objects, choices, or avenues of action that we are facing,&rdquo; says Daniella Furman at the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, people who are in tune with their bodies have a richer, more vivid emotional life &ndash; including both the ups and downs of life. &ldquo;We may not be able to describe the particular physiological signature of a pleasurable experience, but we would probably recognise the sensations when they occur,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Emotional barometer</strong></p><p>These <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106893\">secret bodily signals may also lie behind our intuition</a> &ndash; the indefinable hunches that you have the winning hand in poker, say, according to an elegant study by Barney Dunn at the University of Exeter. The task was simple: the volunteers were asked to choose cards from four decks, and they would win money if it matched the colour of another, upturned card.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhbg\"}}</p><p>The game was rigged so that you were slightly more likely to win from two of the decks, and lose if you picked from the other two. Dunn found that the people who could track their heartbeat with the most accuracy would tend to pick from certain decks, whereas those with poor interoception were more likely to choose at random.&nbsp;</p><p>The bodily-aware people weren&rsquo;t always correct &ndash; they were the worst losers as well as the best winners &ndash; but the point was that they were more likely to follow their hunches.</p><p>So the folklore may be right: people who are in touch with their heart are more likely to be swayed by their instincts &ndash; for good or bad. All of which prompted Ibanez to wonder what would happen when you are fitted with an artificial heart? If Carlos experienced substantial changes, it would offer important new evidence that our mind extends well beyond the brain.</p><p>And that is exactly what he found. When Carlos tapped out his pulse, for instance, he followed the machine&rsquo;s rhythms rather than his own heartbeat. The fact that this also changed other perceptions of his body &ndash; seeming to expand the size of his chest, for instance &ndash; is perhaps to be expected; in some ways, changing the position of the heart was creating a sensation not unlike the famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/visualized-heartbeat-out-of-body-experience/28728/\">rubber hand illusion</a>&rdquo;. But crucially, it also seemed to have markedly altered certain social and emotional skills. Carlos seemed to lack empathy when he viewed pictures of people having a painful accident, for instance. He also had more general problems with his ability to read other&rsquo;s motives, and, crucially, intuitive decision making &ndash; all of which is in line with the idea that the body rules emotional cognition. &ldquo;It is a very interesting, very intriguing study,&rdquo; says Dunn of the findings.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A lifeless shell&rdquo;</p><p></strong></p><p>Sadly, Carlos died from complications during later treatments &ndash; but Ibanez now hopes to continue his studies with other patients. He is currently performing tests on people undergoing a full heart transplant to see how it could influence interoception. Damage to the vagal nerve should cut off some of the internal signals sent from the heart to the brain, which might then impact their cognition.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhd7\"}}</p><p>Away from the cardiac clinic, he is also looking at whether a fault in the link between body and brain could lead to strange depersonalisation disorders, in which patients have the eerie feeling that they don&rsquo;t inhabit their own body. &ldquo;I feel as though I'm not alive, as though my body is an empty, lifeless shell,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1025389031000138538\">one patient told researchers</a>. &ldquo;I seem to be walking in a world I recognise but don't feel.&rdquo; Ibanez has found that they tend to show worse interoception, and brain scans suggest that this results from a breakdown in communication across the anterior insula &ndash; a deep fold of the cortex that is, tellingly, implicated in <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098769\">body awareness, emotion perception, empathy, decision making &ndash; and the sense of self</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dunn, who is a clinical psychologist, is more concerned about its relevance to depression. &ldquo;At the moment therapy is very much in the head &ndash; we change what the client thinks and trust that their emotions will follow up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I often hit a wall: they say that they know these things intellectually, but emotionally they can&rsquo;t feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Even after therapy has trained more positive thinking, the patient may still struggle to feel joy, for example &ndash; a problem that Dunn suspects may come from poor interoception. He gives the example that when you are walking around the park, your body might give you all sorts of pleasant feedback that shows you are relaxed and peaceful. &ldquo;But depressed clients seem to walk around the park without being engaged with the sensory experience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and then they come back and say it was flat and empty&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkj1d\"}}</p><p>Along these lines, Furman has found that people with major depressive disorder (but without other complications like anxiety) struggle to feel their own heart beat; and the poorer their awareness, the less likely they were to report positive experiences in their daily life. And as Dunn&rsquo;s work on decision making would have suggested, poor body perception also seemed to be linked to measures of indecision &ndash; a problem that blights many people with depression. Furman stresses, however, that there may be many different kinds of depression, and poor bodily awareness may only influence some of them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clear why some people may have reduced bodily awareness, but Dunn thinks it can be trained, with practice. He is currently looking into the use of mindfulness-based therapy, which encourages people to focus on the sensations in their body. He says the challenge is to try to recognise the feelings, even if they are unpleasant, without reacting to them in a knee-jerk way. You should then be better equipped to use the body as the &ldquo;emotional barometer&rdquo; to inform you about your state of mind and decide how to act. Another group has <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038304\">designed a rudimentary computer game</a> that asks you to tap a key with every four heartbeats, and flashes red when you are wrong, offering feedback that should boost body awareness.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? You can enjoy a richer, more emotional life; tune into the sensory pleasures of the world, and make better decisions. And all you have to do is listen to your heart.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141205-the-man-with-two-hearts&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2d%2Fkh%2Fp02dkh7c.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Share this story on Facebook</em></a><em>, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The mind-bending effects of feeling two hearts ","HeadlineShort":"The man with two hearts","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"When a man was fitted with a new heart, his mind changed in unusual ways.

First German, then Hindi, Nepali, Polish, Croatian, Mandarin and Thai &ndash; they&rsquo;ve barely spoken one language before the conversation seamlessly melds into another. Together, they pass through about 20 different languages or so in total.</p><p>Back inside, I find small groups exchanging tongue twisters. Others are gathering in threes, preparing for a rapid-fire game that involves interpreting two different languages simultaneously. It looks like the perfect recipe for a headache, but they are nonchalant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a common situation for us,&rdquo; a woman called Alisa tells me.<strong><br /> </strong></p><p>It can be difficult enough to learn one foreign tongue. Yet I&rsquo;m here in Berlin for the <a href=\"http://polyglotberlin.com/\">Polyglot Gathering,</a> a meeting of 350 or so people who speak multiple languages&nbsp;&ndash; some as diverse as Manx, Klingon and Saami, the language of reindeer herders in Scandinavia. Indeed, a surprising proportion of them are &ldquo;hyperglots&rdquo;, like Keeley and Krasa, who can speak at least 10 languages. One of the most proficient linguists I meet here, Richard Simcott, leads a team of polyglots at a company called eModeration &ndash; and he uses about 30 languages himself.</p><p>With a modest knowledge of Italian and some rudimentary Danish, I feel somewhat out of place among the hyperglots. But they say you should learn from the best, so I am here to try to discover their secrets.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02scq0j\"}}</p><p>When you consider the challenges for the brain, it&rsquo;s no wonder most of us find learning a language so demanding. We have many different memory systems, and mastering a different tongue requires all of them. There&rsquo;s procedural memory &ndash; the fine programming of muscles to perfect an accent &ndash; and declarative memory, which is the ability to remember facts (at least 10,000 new words if you want to come close to native fluency, not to mention the grammar). What&rsquo;s more, unless you want to sound like a stuttering robot, those words and structures have to make it to the tip of your tongue within a split second, meaning they have to be programmed in both &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; and &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; memory.</p><blockquote><p> Speaking extra languages delays dementia by five years or more </p></blockquote><p>That tough mental workout comes with big payoffs, however; it is arguably the best brain training you can try. Numerous studies have shown that being multilingual can improve attention and memory, and that this can provide a &ldquo;cognitive reserve&rdquo; that delays the onset of dementia. Looking at the experiences of immigrants, Ellen Bialystok at York University in Canada has found that speaking two languages <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24959001\">delayed dementia diagnosis by five years</a>. Those who knew three languages, however, were diagnosed 6.4 years later than monolinguals, while for those fluent in four or more languages, enjoyed an extra nine years of healthy cognition.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02scq52\"}}</p><p>Those lasting benefits are a stark contrast to the failure of most commercial &ldquo;brain training&rdquo; games you can download &ndash; which <a href=\"http://longevity3.stanford.edu/blog/2014/10/15/the-consensus-on-the-brain-training-industry-from-the-scientific-community-2/\">generally fail to offer long-term improvements in memory or attention.</a></p><blockquote><p> Learning a new language as we age is easier than you might assume </p></blockquote><p>Until recently, however, many neuroscientists had suggested that most of us are too old to reach native-like fluency in a fresh language; according to the &ldquo;critical period hypothesis&rdquo;, there is a narrow window during childhood in which we can pick up the nuances of a new language. Yet Bialystok&rsquo;s research suggests this may have been exaggerated; rather than a steep precipice, she has found that there is a very slight decline in our abilities as we age.</p><p>Certainly, many of the hyperglots I meet in Berlin have mastered languages later in life. Keeley grew up in Florida, where he was exposed to native Spanish speakers at school.&nbsp; As a child, he used to tune into foreign radio stations &ndash; despite not being able to understand a word. &ldquo;It was like music to me,&rdquo; he says. But it was only as an adult that he started travelling the world &ndash; first to Colombia, where he also studied French, German and Portuguese at college. He then moved on to Switzerland and Eastern Europe before heading to Japan. He now speaks at least 20 languages fluently, almost all of which were learnt as an adult. &ldquo;The critical period hypothesis is a bunch of crap,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02scpkv\"}}</p><p>The question is, how do hyperglots master so many new tongues &ndash; and could the rest of us try to emulate them? True, they may just be more motivated than most. Many, like Keeley, are globe-trotters who have moved from country to country, picking up languages as they go. It&rsquo;s sometimes a case of sink or swim.</p><p>Yet even with the best intentions, many of us struggle to speak another language convincingly. Keeley, who is currently writing a book on the &ldquo;social, psychological and affective factors in becoming multilingual&rdquo;, is sceptical that it&rsquo;s simply a question of raw intelligence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a major factor, although it does make it faster to have the analytical ability,&rdquo; he says.</p><p><strong>Cultural chameleons</strong></p><p>Instead, he thinks we need to look past the intellect, into the depths of our personality. Keeley&rsquo;s theory is that learning a new language causes you to re-invent your sense of self &ndash; and the best linguists are particularly good at taking on new identities. &ldquo;You become a chameleon,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Psychologists have long known that the words we speak are entwined with our identity. It&rsquo;s a cliche that French makes you more romantic, or Italian makes you more passionate, but each language becomes associated with cultural norms that can affect how you behave &ndash; it could be as simple as whether you value outspoken confidence or quiet reflection, for instance. Importantly, various studies have found that multilingual people often adopt different behaviours according to the language they are speaking.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02scqqd\"}}</p><p>Different languages can also evoke different memories of your life &ndash; as the writer Vladimir Nabokov discovered when working on his autobiography. The native Russian speaker wrote it first in his second language, English, with agonising difficulty, finding that &ldquo;my memory was attuned to one key &ndash; the musically reticent Russian, but it was forced into another key, English&rdquo;. Once it was finally published, he decided to translate the memoirs back into the language of his childhood, but as the Russian words flowed, he found his memories started to unfurl with new details and perspectives. &ldquo;His Russian version differed so much he felt the need to retranslate to English,&rdquo; says Aneta Pavlenko at Temple University in Philadelphia, whose book, The Bilingual Mind, explores many of these effects. It was almost as if his English and Russian selves had subtly different pasts.</p><p>Resisting the process of reinvention may prevent you from learning another language so well, says Keeley, who is a professor of cross-cultural management at Kyushu Sangyo University in Japan. He recently <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/8816844/The_Importance_of_Self-Identity_and_Ego_Permeability_in_Foreign_Culture_Adaptation_and_Foreign_Language_Acquisition\">ran a survey of Chinese speakers learning Japanese</a> to examine their &ldquo;ego permeability&rdquo; &ndash; with questions such as &ldquo;I find it easy to put myself in other&rsquo;s shoes and imagine how they feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can do impressions of other people&rdquo;, and whether you can change your opinions to suit the people you are near. As he suspected, the people who score highly on these traits had much greater fluency in their new language.</p><blockquote><p> It is not just about the amount of time spent learning and using languages </p></blockquote><p>How come? It&rsquo;s well known that if you identify with someone, you are more likely to mimic them &ndash; a process that would effortlessly improve language learning. But the adopted identity, and the associated memories, may also stop you from confusing the language with your mother tongue &ndash; by building neural barriers between the languages. &ldquo;There must be some type of home in your mind for each language and culture and the related experiences, in order for the languages to stay active and not get all mixed together,&rdquo; Keeley says. &ldquo;It is not just the amount of time spent learning and using the languages. The quality of the time, in terms of emotional salience, is critical.&rdquo; Indeed, that might explain why Keeley could switch so effortlessly between those 20-odd languages.</p><p>Of all the polyglots, Michael Levi Harris may demonstrate these principles the best. An actor by training, Harris also has an advanced knowledge of 10 languages, and an intermediate understanding of 12 more. Occasionally, his passion has landed him in some difficulty. He once saw an online ad for a Maltese meet-up. Going along, he hoped to find a group of people from Malta, only to walk into a room full of middle-aged women and their <a href=\"http://www.animalplanet.com/breed-selector/dog-breeds/toy/maltese.html\">white lap dogs</a> &ndash; an experience he recently relayed in a short film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2852262/\">The Hyperglot</a>. You can see a trailer below.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"The-Hyperglot-Teaser-2013-Micha\"}}</p><p>When I meet him in a cafe near the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, he effortlessly slips into a rather posh, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation\">received pronunciation</a>&rdquo; English accent, despite being a native New Yorker. As he does so, his whole posture changes as he melds into the new persona. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really trying to consciously change my character or my persona. It just happens, but I know that I am suddenly different.&rdquo;</p><p>Importantly, Harris thinks that anyone can learn to adopt a new cultural skin in this way &ndash; and he has a few tips for how to begin, based on his experiences of acting. The important thing, he says, is to try to imitate without even considering the spelling of the words. &ldquo;Everyone can listen and repeat,&rdquo; he says. You may find yourself over-exaggerating, in the same way that an actor may be a little over-the-top in their performance to start with &ndash; but that&rsquo;s a crucial part of the process, he says. &ldquo;In acting first, you go really big, and then the director says OK, now tone it down. And you do the same with a language.&rdquo; He also suggests looking carefully at things like facial expressions &ndash; since they can be crucial to producing the sounds. Speaking with slightly pouted lips instantly makes you sound a little bit more French, for instance.</p><p>Finally, he says you should try to overcome the embarrassment associated with producing \"strange\" noises &ndash; such as the guttural sounds in Arabic, for instance. &ldquo;You have to realise it&rsquo;s not foreign to us &ndash; when you are disgusted, you already say &lsquo;eugh&rsquo;. And if you acknowledge and give your subconscious permission to do it in speech, you can make the sound.&rdquo; That may sound a little silly, but the point is that all this should help you to get over your natural inhibitions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all to do with owning the language, which is what actors have to do to make the audience believe that these words are yours. When you own words you can speak more confidently, which is how people will engage with you.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02scqht\"}}</p><blockquote><p> There&rsquo;s one big factor that stops people learning languages efficiently&hellip; </p></blockquote><p>Even so, most agree that you shouldn&rsquo;t be too ambitious, particularly when starting out. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a single factor that stops people learning languages efficiently, it&rsquo;s that we feel we have to be native-like &ndash; it&rsquo;s an unreachable standard that looms over us,&rdquo; says Temple University&rsquo;s Pavlenko. &ldquo;The ease of expression is what matters to me a lot &ndash; finding a better way to express myself, colloquially.&rdquo;</p><p>Along these lines, you should also practice a little and often &ndash; perhaps just for 15-minute stints, four times a day. &ldquo;I think the analogies with exercise are quite good,&rdquo; says Alex Rawlings, who has developed a series of <a href=\"http://polyglotworkshops.com/about/\">polyglot workshops</a> with Richard Simcott to teach their techniques. Even if you are too busy or tired to do serious study, just practising a dialogue or listening to a foreign pop song can help, says Simcott.</p><p>In the UK, Australia and US, it is easy to believe that we don&rsquo;t need to make that effort. Indeed, before I met the hyperglots, I had wondered if their obsession merited the hard work; perhaps, I thought, it was just about bragging rights. Yet all of the hyperglots I meet are genuinely enthusiastic about the amazing benefits that can only be achieved by this full immersion in different languages &ndash; including the chance to make friends and connections, even across difficult cultural barriers.</p><p>Harris, for instance, describes living in Dubai. &ldquo;As a Jewish person living in the Middle East, I faced challenges. But it turns out that one of my best friends was from Lebanon,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And when I moved away, he said &lsquo;when we first met I didn&rsquo;t think I could be friends with you and now you&rsquo;re leaving, I&rsquo;m distraught&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s one of the most precious things to me.&rdquo;</p><p>As Judith Meyer, who organised the gathering in Berlin, tells me, she saw Ukrainians and Russians, Israelis and Palestinians all conversing at the gathering. &ldquo;Learning another language really does open up whole new worlds.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Follow us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"<p>This is part of BBC Future&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/best-of-2015\">Best of 2015</a>&rdquo; list, our greatest hits of the year, including:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151123-how-dark-is-your-personality\">How dark is your personality?</a>&nbsp;<br /> -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150402-the-worst-place-on-earth\">The dystopian lake filled by the world&rsquo;s tech lust</a><br /> -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150906-the-best-and-worst-ways-to-spot-a-liar\">How to spot a liar</a><br /> -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150213-the-downsides-of-being-beautiful\">The downsides of being drop dead gorgeous</a></p>\n<p>&hellip;and much more.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/best-of-2015\">Browse the full list</a>.</p>","CalloutPosition":"top","CalloutSubtitle":"Our top stories","CalloutTitle":"Best of 2015","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-05-29T08:41:24Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"How to learn 30 languages","HeadlineShort":"How to learn 30 languages","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Some people can speak a seemingly impossible number of tongues.

He had gym in the morning, where he played volleyball for 45 minutes. He then entered his office to clear a backlog of emails, before heading to the dentist&rsquo;s for root-canal surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember getting into the chair and the dentist inserting the local anaesthetic,&rdquo; he tells me. After that? A complete blank.</p><blockquote><p> It is as if all new memories are being written in invisible ink that slowly disappears. </p></blockquote><p>Since then, he has been unable to remember almost anything for longer than 90 minutes. So while he can still tell me about the first time he met the Duke of York for a briefing at the Ministry of Defence, he can&rsquo;t even remember where he&rsquo;s living now; he wakes up every morning believing he is still in Germany in 2005, waiting to visit the dentist. Without a record of new experiences, the passing of time means nothing to him. Today, he only knows that there is a problem because he and his wife have written detailed notes on his smartphone, in a file labelled &ldquo;First thing &ndash; read this&rdquo;.</p><p>It is as if all new memories are being written in invisible ink that slowly disappears. How could minor dental work have affected his brain in such a profound way? This real-life medical mystery offers a rare glimpse at the hidden depths of the brain&rsquo;s workings.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzr8k\"}}</p><p>Even the events leading up to William&rsquo;s amnesia are highly puzzling. At the time of the surgery, the dentist didn&rsquo;t realise that anything was wrong; it was only after they asked him to take off his protective dark glasses that they saw he was pale, and struggled to stand up. They called his wife. &ldquo;He was lying on a couch,&rdquo; Samantha recalls. (Both their names have been altered to preserve the family's privacy). &ldquo;His eyes were staring; he looked surprised to see me &ndash; he had no clue what was going on.&rdquo; By 5pm he was removed to hospital, where he stayed for three days. Even after some of the mental fog dissipated, he was still unable to recall anything for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The doctors initially suspected that he&rsquo;d reacted badly to the anaesthetic, causing a brain haemorrhage &ndash; yet they failed to find evidence of injury. So he was discharged with the mystery still hanging over him, and the family moved back to England, where he was referred to the office of <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/psychology/ppl/gb222\">Gerald Burgess</a>, a clinical psychologist in Leicester.</p><p><strong>The brain&rsquo;s printing press</strong></p><p>The obvious explanation would have been that William had a form of &ldquo;anterograde amnesia&rdquo;, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison\">Henry Molaison</a>, whose experiences have informed much of what we know about memory. During brain surgery to treat his epilepsy, surgeons sliced out a large chunk of Molaison&rsquo;s grey matter, including his hippocampi &ndash; seahorse-shaped regions at the centre of the brain. They act as our memory&rsquo;s printing press, stamping the &ldquo;episodic memories&rdquo; of events into long-term storage &ndash; and without them, Molaison was unable to hold on to anything that occurred after the surgery.</p><blockquote><p> William could work out how to solve a complex maze, only to completely forget the skill three days later. </p></blockquote><p>Yet as William&rsquo;s first doctors had noted, brain scans seemed to show that these crucial areas were still intact. Nor did his symptoms exactly match those of other anterograde amnesiacs. While Molaison couldn&rsquo;t remember details of personal events, for instance, he could learn new &ldquo;procedural&rdquo; skills since they are processed in different parts of the brain. When Burgess asked William to work out how to solve a complex maze, however, he had completely forgotten the skill three days later. &ldquo;It was like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu replica of the same errors &ndash; he took the same time to relearn the task once more,&rdquo; says Burgess.</p><p>One possibility is that William&rsquo;s amnesia is a &ldquo;psychogenic illness&rdquo;. Some patients report memory loss after a traumatic event &ndash; but that tends to be a coping mechanism to avoid thinking about painful past events; it doesn&rsquo;t normally affect your ability to remember the present. Samantha says that William had suffered no trauma, and according to Burgess&rsquo;s detailed psychiatric assessments, he is otherwise emotionally healthy. &ldquo;He was a successful father and military officer with good job evaluations,&rdquo; says Burgess. &ldquo;There was no reason to think that there was anything wrong psychiatrically.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzqmd\"}}</p><p>Given the evidence, Burgess instead suspects the answer may be hiding in the thicket of tiny neural connections we call &ldquo;synapses&rdquo;. Once we have experienced an event, the memories are slowly cemented in the long term by altering these richly woven networks. That process of &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; involves the production of new proteins to rebuild the synapses in their new shape; without it, the memory remains fragile and is easily eroded with time. Block that protein synthesis in rats, and they soon forget anything they have just learnt. Crucially, 90 minutes would be about the right time for this consolidation to take place &ndash; just as William starts to forget the details of the event. Rather than losing its printing press, like Molaison, William's brain seems to have simply run out of ink.</p><p>Even so, it&rsquo;s not clear why root canal surgery should have made his brain run dry in this way. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the million-pound question&rdquo;, says Burgess, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t have an answer.&rdquo; Scouring the medical literature, he found five similar cases of mysterious memory loss without brain damage. Although none occurred during a trip to the dentist, they do seem to follow other periods of physiological stress during a medical emergency. &ldquo;It could be a genetic predisposition that needs a catalyst event to start the process,&rdquo; says Burgess.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzrck\"}}</p><p>Burgess hopes that his new paper, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25978125\">which appears in Neurocase journal</a>, will encourage other psychologists to share similar stories and perhaps spark other theories. They are already intrigued. &ldquo;It is a bit of a head scratcher,&rdquo; admits <a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/academics/aggleton.php\">John Aggleton, at Cardiff University</a> in the UK. He would like to see more detailed tests, looking more specifically at the long-distance connectivity of the brain. Even if there&rsquo;s no damage to the brain cells themselves, William may be missing some of the necessary wiring around the hippocampi and other parts of the memory processing pipeline, he thinks.</p><p>For the time being, William helps to remind us just how little we know about our own minds. Mesmerised by colourful MRI scans, many now think of the brain as a kind of computer, with separate chips devoted &ldquo;memory&rdquo;, &ldquo;fear&rdquo; or &ldquo;sex&rdquo;. &nbsp;Yet William perfectly demonstrates why this modular view of the mind is over-simplistic. Even when all that machinery is apparently intact, you can still find yourself lost in the present, with no way of bridging the past and the future. Clearly, the brain has many more layers to be peeled away before we can get to the heart of what makes us who we are.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzqdm\"}}</p><blockquote><p> In the last 10 years, William has been able to cling to one new fact &ndash; his father&rsquo;s death. </p></blockquote><p>William also demonstrates just how the powerfully our emotions shape our minds. In the last 10 years, he has been able to cling to one new fact &ndash; his father&rsquo;s death. Somehow, the force of his grief helped him to forge new tracks in the brain and grasp on to that fact, when everything else has slipped away. Even then, he is unable to remember the events surrounding it, nor the bedside vigil in his last few days.</p><p>When I speak to him, he has just relearnt &ndash; for the thousandth time &ndash; that his daughter and son are now 21 and 18, not the young children he remembers. He hopes the rest of their lives will not be lost to him. &ldquo;I want to walk my daughter down the aisle and remember it. Should they become parents, I would like to remember that I have grandchildren, and who they are.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-07-01T15:01:42Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"‘My dentist saved my tooth, but wiped my memory’","HeadlineShort":"‘My dentist extracted my memory’","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"After simple dental surgery, William lost his ability to form new memories.

Although he had healthy eyes, a brain operation to cure headaches seemed to have destroyed a region that was crucial for vision. The result was that almost everything to the left of his nose was invisible to him. It was as if he were looking out of a window, with the curtains drawn across half of his world.</p><blockquote><p> Daniel was adamant that he could not see a thing, yet somehow his unconscious mind was guiding him correctly </p></blockquote><p>And yet, as Sanders began testing him, he noticed something very strange: Daniel could reach out and grab Sanders&rsquo; hand, even when it must have fallen right behind his blind spot. It was as if some kind of &ldquo;second sight&rdquo; was guiding his behaviour, beyond his conscious awareness.</p><p>Intrigued, Sanders referred Daniel to the psychologists Elizabeth Warrington and Lawrence Weiskrantz, who confirmed the hunch with <a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0140673674929079/1-s2.0-S0140673674929079-main.pdf?_tid=4e2e1084-6110-11e5-862d-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1442916016_b1ee156e7c163df4e829f850cbcfa79b\">a series of clever tests</a>. They placed a screen in front of Daniel&rsquo;s blind spot, for instance, and asked him to point at a circle, when it appeared in different places. Daniel was adamant that he could not see a thing, but Weiskrantz persuaded him to just &ldquo;take a guess&rdquo;. Surprisingly, he was almost always right. Or Weiskrantz and Warrington would present a single line on the screen, and Daniel had to decide whether it was horizontal or vertical. Again, Daniel was adamant that nothing had appeared before his eyes, yet his accuracy was around 80%, much more than if he had been guessing randomly.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p033j6ld\"}}</p><blockquote><p> How many of our decisions occur out of our awareness, even when we have the illusion of control? </p></blockquote><p>Clearly, despite his blindness, Daniel&rsquo;s healthy eyes were still watching the world and passing the information to his unconscious, which was guiding his behaviour. Publishing a report in 1974, Weiskrantz coined the term &ldquo;blindsight&rdquo; to describe this fractured conscious state. &ldquo;Some were sceptical, of course, but it has held its own and become an accepted phenomenon,&rdquo; Weiskrantz says today. And over the following decades, the condition has come to answer some fundamental questions about the human mind.</p><p>Just how many of our decisions occur out of our awareness, even when we have the illusion of control? And if the conscious mind is not needed to direct our actions, then what is its purpose? Why did we evolve this vivid internal life, if we are almost &ldquo;zombies&rdquo; acting without awareness?</p><p>&ldquo;These cases open a window into parts of the brain that are normally not visible,&rdquo; says Marco Tamietto, who is based at Tilburg University. &ldquo;They offer a view to functions that are difficult to observe &ndash; that are normally silent.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Unravelling the mind</strong></p><p>Consciousness is so deeply intertwined with everything we do, that many scientists had previously believed it would be impossible to study. How can you pick apart the rich fabric of our minds to find the one thread that gives rise to the vivid sense of awareness, of feeling and &ldquo;being&rdquo; and experiencing the world, without unravelling everything else around it?</p><p>Daniel, whose name has been changed for this article and is known in the literature simply as DB, offered some of the first clues. &ldquo;What you want to do is to look at something that is as close to consciousness as possible, but which is lacking that specific quality, that subjective experience,&rdquo; says Christopher Allen at Cardiff University. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what blindsight gives you. The participant is still perceiving, but they lack awareness of perception.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Despite their blindness, these people can somehow sense emotions in a face &ndash; and they even start to unconsciously mimic the expressions </p></blockquote><p>One of the first tasks was to test exactly what blindsight patients are capable of without their conscious visual awareness &ndash; and the results have been quite remarkable. Of particular interest has been the fact that they can sense emotion: when presented with faces, they can tell whether it is happy or sad, angry or surprised, and they even start to unconsciously mimic the expressions. &ldquo;Even though they did not report anything at a conscious level, we could show a change in attitude, a synchronisation of emotional expressions to the pictures in their blind field,&rdquo; says Tamietto, who has worked extensively with Weiskrantz.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p033j3ms\"}}</p><p>Besides mirroring expressions, they also show physiological signs of stress when they see a picture of a frightened face. &ldquo;The plan for the future is to try to train them to pay attention to bodily reactions,&rdquo; says Tamietto. It might be helpful to notice if they are in danger, for instance. &ldquo;They can use the bodily changes to understand what&rsquo;s going on in the world &ndash; as an indication that there is something interesting or problematic.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2008, Tamietto and Weiskrantz&rsquo;s team put another blindsight patient through the most gruelling test yet. Unlike Daniel, he was blind across the whole of his visual field, and normally walked with a white cane. But the team took away his cane and then loaded a corridor with furniture that might potentially trip him up, before asking him <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208014334\">make his way to the other side</a>. &ldquo;Despite saying he wasn&rsquo;t able to see, we saw him shooting by on his very first attempt,&rdquo; says Tamietto. You can watch it for yourself, on the video below.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"TN-Blindsight\"}}</p><p>Importantly, the participant claimed that not only was he not aware of having seen anything; he was not even aware of having moved out of the way of the objects. He insisted he had just walked straight down the hallway. According to Beatrice de Gelder, who led the work, he was &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/uncanny-sight-in-the-blind/\">at a loss to explain or even describe his actions</a>&rdquo;.<strong><br /> </strong></p><blockquote><p> It was like seeing a black shadow moving against a completely black background </p></blockquote><p>Only in very rare circumstances do they come close to being aware of what they are seeing. For instance, one subject was able to distinguish movement in fast, high-contrast films; he described it as being like &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810014001780\">a black shadow moving against a completely black background</a>&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; a &ldquo;sense of knowing&rdquo; that there was something beyond. But even then, he could not describe the content itself, meaning that his experience lacked almost everything we would normally associate with vision. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of controversy about whether those reports truly reflect visual experiences,&rdquo; says Kentridge.</p><p><strong>Reversible blindness</strong></p><p>Of all the questions these studies have posed, the most pressing has been why? What causes the conscious and unconscious to decouple so spectacularly? Tellingly, all the blindsight subjects had suffered damage to a region known as V1, at the back of the head, suggesting that it is this region that normally projects the stream of images into our awareness.</p><p>To test their ideas, scientists can use a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that disrupts different brain regions, in an attempt to induce a reversible form of blindsight in healthy participants. Keen to know how it feels, I recently took part in one of those experiments at Allen&rsquo;s lab in Cardiff, UK. (You can see a video of the procedure below.)</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p033jh42\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>The technique is called &ldquo;transcranial magnetic stimulation&rdquo;, which uses a strong magnetic field to scramble the neural activity underneath the skull. &ldquo;The advantage is that you don&rsquo;t have to cut someone&rsquo;s head open to demonstrate the same behavioural characteristics as clinical blindsight,&rdquo; Allen told me before the experiment.</p><blockquote><p> Eventually I noticed a fleeting dark line cross my vision, a bit like an old TV monitor just after you pressed the off switch </p></blockquote><p>The experiment began with Allen placing a magnet over the back of my skull, just above V1. Next, he began applying the magnetic field for short intervals at increasing strengths. At first, all I could feel was a slight tapping sensation (the effect of the magnetic field on my skin) but eventually I did notice a fleeting dark line crossing the centre of my vision, a bit like an old TV monitor just after you pressed the off switch. It only lasted less than a second, however, and although it gave me a small shock, I soon became used to the sensation.</p><p>After Allen had found the right power, I sat in front of a computer screen, and he flashed up pictures of arrows for a split second: my job was to say whether they pointed left or right. The pictures were sometimes timed with the TMS signals causing the temporary blindness &ndash; and like Daniel in those original experiments, I often saw nothing and felt that I was guessing. Nevertheless, once I had finished, Allen told me that I had answered many more correctly than would be expected by chance alone, suggesting the TMS had succeeded in giving me blindsight.</p><p>Through studies such as this, Allen has found tentative evidence that the visual information is funnelled through the &ldquo;lateral geniculate nucleus&rdquo;, deep in the centre of the brain &ndash; a bypass around V1 that allows the information to be processed unconsciously in areas involved in emotion or movement.</p><p>Eventually, the researchers may even understand how the brain creates visual consciousness itself &ndash; and why V1 is so crucial. One idea is that consciousness relies on communication to and from many areas of the brain &ndash; and maybe V1 is working as a hub that helps orchestrate that broadcast.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p033j2t7\"}}</p><p>Picking apart the experience may also reveal further clues about the power of unconscious mind. To understand how, imagine that you are part of a strange puppet show. You have been blindfolded, and your limbs are tied to invisible strings. Every so often, they are tugged here or there by a hidden puppet master, leading you through a complicated dance. To the audience, it looks like you are in full control of your actions, but you don&rsquo;t have the foggiest idea of what you&rsquo;ve just done.</p><blockquote><p> The non-conscious mind acts as the puppet master, pulling the strings without their knowledge </p></blockquote><p>That puppet show is essentially what happens when someone with blindsight navigates their way past obstacles &ndash; with the non-conscious mind acting as the puppet master. &ldquo;It shows that awareness isn&rsquo;t the whole story,&rdquo; says Tamietto. &ldquo;Very often we believe we have decided something, but our brain has made the decision for us before that &ndash; in many ways, and in many contexts.&rdquo;</p><p>Juha Silvanto at the University of Westminster &nbsp;agrees: &ldquo;Consciousness is just a summary of all the information coming in, but the fact the subconscious can guide behaviour suggests that elaborate processing is going on without us being aware of it.&rdquo; Indeed, some philosophers have gone as far as to wonder whether we could be little more than &ldquo;zombies&rdquo; acting on mostly unconscious impulses.</p><blockquote><p> Some philosophers have gone as far as to claim that we could be little more than &ldquo;zombies&rdquo; acting on mostly unconscious impulses </p></blockquote><p>This, in turn, begins to cast doubt on some long-held assumptions about the very nature, and purpose, of consciousness. After all, it is by no means certain that other animals have a rich inner life like us, so it must have emerged for some reason. Previously, psychologists had proposed that we have a kind of &ldquo;spotlight of attention&rdquo; that sweeps over our vision, and when it lands on an object, the object pops into consciousness. In this way, our heightened awareness helps highlight the most important parts of a scene, giving us the chance to respond.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p033j5gq\"}}</p><p>Except Robert Kentridge at the University of Durham has evidence to suggest this too may be wrong. His insight came when he was talking to a blindsight subject in between some of the basic visual tests, in which he flashed different images at different parts of the blind spot. The subject had said that he thought he would do better if we were told where, in the blind spot, the image would appear. &ldquo;It seemed very strange,&rdquo; says Kentridge &ndash; since they have no awareness of what is in their blind spots, they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to focus their attention there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if you were trying to direct attention around the back of head &ndash; you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Even so, he was happy to play along and design a separate experiment where he could give the subject a clue about where the image might appear. The results <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15037061\">were a kind of paradox</a>: even though the participant was still not able to actually see anything, his subconscious discrimination seemed to be quicker. In other words, the subject really was &ldquo;paying attention&rdquo; &ndash; but without being conscious of exactly what he was attending.</p><p>For this reason, Kentridge thinks we need to rethink our ideas about consciousness and attention. Rather than it acting as a spotlight to boost perception, he instead suspects that consciousness may have evolved to boost memory, drawing together all the different pieces of information into a cohesive picture that is easier to remember. &ldquo;You need to encode what&rsquo;s happening in the world in a single package,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>These are just the first of many clues that may eventually solve the riddles of human consciousness. Sadly, Daniel will not be taking part in those further experiments. &ldquo;He passed away last November, but was a willing subject for many years,&rdquo; Weiskrantz tells me. By gently reaching into his darkness, however, he has shown the way for others to follow, guiding us through some of the biggest mysteries of the human mind.</p><p><em>David Robson is BBC Future&rsquo;s feature writer.

Almost every night, her husband would wake her up from sleep to tell her another bon mot that had just come to mind. In a bid to finally get a good night&rsquo;s rest, she eventually persuaded him to write them down rather than telling her directly.</p><p>Soon, he had filled 50 pages with witticisms such as:</p><p><em>Went to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get my driver&rsquo;s license. They gave me an eye exam and here is what they said: ABCDEFG, HIJKMNLOP, QRS, TUV, WXY and Z; now I know my ABC&rsquo;s, can I have my license please?</em></p><p>And</p><p><em>How do you cure hunger? Step away from the buffet table.</em></p><p>They are not exactly the wit of Oscar Wilde, yet Derek (not his real name) would erupt in fits of laughter at these small quips. (Many of the jokes were too rude to repeat in this article.)</p><blockquote><p> As you can imagine, after five years of these inane gags, Derek&rsquo;s wife found herself at her wit&rsquo;s end </p></blockquote><p>As you can imagine, after five years of these inane gags, his wife found herself at her wit&rsquo;s end, and she was also concerned about other strange behaviours &ndash; including shop-lifting candy from their local stores. Finally, she arranged to visit the neurologist Mario Mendez at the University of California, Los Angeles. &ldquo;He constantly cracked jokes during the interview, to the point of being difficult to interrupt,&rdquo; recalls Mendez, whose report can be found in a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26900737\">recent neuroscience journal</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03lygh3\"}}</p><p>Mendez diagnosed him with a condition called Witzelsucht (addiction to wisecracking), brought on, it seems, by two strokes, five years apart. As Derek&rsquo;s family found, the disorder itself is no joke, but exploring this strange compulsion may nevertheless shed light on the complex brain processing underlying a normal sense of humour.</p><blockquote><p> As the doctor started manipulating the cancerous growth, his patient suddenly erupted in a manic flight of speech involving many, terrible puns </p></blockquote><p>One of the first noted cases of this pathological joking emerged in the strangest circumstances by the German neurologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otfrid_Foerster\">Otfrid Foerster</a> in 1929. Foerster was operating on a male patient to remove a tumour. The man was still conscious &ndash; as was common practice at the time &ndash; but as he started manipulating the cancerous growth, the man suddenly erupted in a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=XwMoG3zlYVwC&amp;lpg=PT34&amp;dq=foerster%20witzelsucht&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=foerster%20witzelsucht&amp;f=false\">manic flight of speech</a>&rdquo;, compulsively recounting pun after awful pun. That same year, the psychiatrist Abraham Brill reported coming across similar patients who would joke about &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201402/passive-joking\">anything and everything</a>&rdquo; &ndash; even when they were not tied to the operating table.</p><p>Since then, many other cases have been noted. Strangely, many of the patients &ndash; including Derek &ndash; fail to respond to other people&rsquo;s jokes, despite apparently finding themselves absolutely hilarious. And this may all come from very similar patterns of brain damage in the frontal lobes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03lygq9\"}}</p><p>Derek, for instance, had suffered a brain haemorrhage 10 years previously, causing damage in the right frontal lobe. This in itself seemed to bring about a change in personality, leading him to compulsively search rubbish bins for objects that could be recycled &ndash; but at that point, he had the same, subdued sense of humour his wife had already known. Then, at some point later, he seems to have suffered a second stroke that damaged the left &ldquo;caudate nucleus&rdquo;. This region, lying deep in the skull, seems to act as a hub connecting the frontal lobes (involved in conscious, analytical thought) and the rest of the brain.</p><p>The result appears to be the sudden, compulsive joking that was slowly driving his wife around the bend. To understand how that particular pattern of brain damage may explain that awful sense of humour, you first need to appreciate the complex processing that lies behind a joke, such as:</p><p><em>How do you make a Venetian blind? Poke him in the eye. </em></p><p>Or this one, <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/11/26/the-ten-funniest-jokes-ever-according-to-science-5527698/#ixzz42JhMh5VI\">deemed by researchers at the University of Oxford</a> to be one of the funniest jokes in the world:</p><p><em>Three guys stranded on a desert island find a magic lantern containing a genie, who grants them each one wish. The first guy wishes he was off the island and back home. The second guy wishes the same. The third guy says: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m lonely. I wish my friends were back here.&rsquo;</em></p><blockquote><p> Resolving a joke&rsquo;s puzzle tickles the brain&rsquo;s pleasure centres, making us laugh </p></blockquote><p>Ok, maybe these quips are funnier when told by a professional comedian. But the point is that each is built around an <a href=\"http://www.richardwiseman.com/LaughLab/incon.html\">&ldquo;incongruity&rdquo; in the punchline</a>, and your brain must jump through a series of hoops to unpick the logic. You need to grasp the semantic associations in the word &ldquo;Venetian blind&rdquo; to grasp the double meaning, and you need to place yourself in the shoes of the people stranded on the desert island. In both cases, there&rsquo;s an element of surprise as you realise the twist in the tale. Resolving that puzzle tickles the brain&rsquo;s pleasure centres, making us laugh (or at least, smile politely). &ldquo;The &lsquo;ha ha&rsquo; moment is not very far from the &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moment,&rdquo; explains Jason Warren at University College London.</p><p>This brain processing appears to occur in a network of regions around the frontal lobes &ndash; the seat of more complex, analytical thought, and the very same areas that are damaged in patients like Derek. &ldquo;They cannot see the relationship of the punchline to the joke, so they do not show surprise,&rdquo; says Mendez.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\" p03lygtf \"}}</p><p>Paradoxically, this brain damage seems to &ldquo;disinhibit&rdquo; some of the signalling between those frontal lobes and the pleasure centres. So while others&rsquo; jokes may leave them cold, their own thoughts and feelings &ndash; stemming from any random connection or association &ndash; may end up triggering the dopamine kick as they collapse in fits of giggles.</p><blockquote><p> The findings could be important in predicting the onset and progression of dementia </p></blockquote><p>At least, that&rsquo;s the theory &ndash; and there could be some serious reasons for investigating this kind of disorder further. Warren works with frontotemporal dementia patients &ndash; a rarer form of neurodegeneration that &ldquo;targets people in the prime of their life&rdquo;. The symptoms include difficulties grasping other people&rsquo;s feelings and motives. &ldquo;It plays havoc with their social functioning&rdquo; &ndash; problems that are often accompanied by an impaired (or inappropriate) sense of humour. (Indeed, another one of Mendez&rsquo;s Witzelsucht patients was suffering from frontotemporal dementia &ndash; though not all the patients will be compulsive jokers themselves.)</p><p>Warren recently asked these patients to judge various cartoon strips and compared the results to scans of their brain&rsquo;s grey matter. Sure enough, many were <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4534772/\">worse at detecting more complex, multi-layered jokes</a> &ndash; preferring instead simpler slapstick comedy (such as a drawing of a shocked woman, whose dress had been ripped off her body by a passing car.) And the harder they found the task, the more damage they showed in the &ldquo;humour network&rdquo;.</p><p>Importantly, he thinks these findings could be important in predicting the onset and progression of the disease. Doctors should take notice if a patient&rsquo;s families have noticed a changed sense of humour &ndash; since it&rsquo;s often the first cue that something is amiss. &ldquo;These changes were reported by caregivers years &ndash; maybe nine years &ndash; before the diagnosis,&rdquo; he says. Eventually, it might even be possible to develop a more standardised comedy test &ndash; similar to the cartoons in his own study &ndash; that helps to index changes in their social understanding and functioning.</p><p>If nothing else, it should give us a greater appreciation of the hurdles we jump through every time we find ourselves tickled by another&rsquo;s wit. &ldquo;Humour is an extremely complex phenomenon, but we often take it for granted,&rdquo; says Warren.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.</p><p>&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\">here</a> &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)</p><p>Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at <a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\">TED2015 in Vancouver</a> last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}</p><p>Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\">handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts</a>. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.</p><p>She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"> bodily motion and visualisation</a> &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\">accent and articulation</a> &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}</p><p>But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.</p><p>Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Infectious giggles</strong></p><p>That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\">to open up about personal information</a> &ndash; paving more common ground between people.</p><p>Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\">laughter correlates with increased pain threshold</a>, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.</p><p>Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}</p><p>For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.</p><p>Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.</p><p>You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\">asking visitors of different ages to judge</a> the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}</p><p>Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.</p><p>Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p>Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.</p><p>So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.</p><p>Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a <a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\">charity gig</a> the following evening, she is very funny.</p><p>As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p>Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.</p></blockquote>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

But not like I had seen before. They were more underwater than above water, they had their eyes wide open &ndash; they were like little dolphins.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Deep in the island archipelagos on the Andaman Sea, and along the west coast of Thailand live small tribes called the Moken people, also known as sea-nomads. Their children spend much of their day in the sea, diving for food. They are uniquely adapted to this job &ndash; because they can see underwater. And it turns out that with a little practice, their unique vision might be accessible to any young person.</p><p>In 1999, Anna Gislen at the University of Lund, in Sweden was investigating different aspects of vision, when a colleague suggested that she might be interested in studying the unique characteristics of the Moken tribe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been sitting in a dark lab for three months, so I thought, &lsquo;yeah, why not go to Asia instead&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Gislen.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03l2ft9\"}}</p><blockquote><p> They had their eyes wide open, fishing for clams, shells and sea cucumbers, with no problem at all -&nbsp;Anna Gislen, researcher </p></blockquote><p>Gislen and her six-year old daughter travelled to Thailand and integrated themselves within the Moken communities, who mostly lived on houses sat upon poles. When the tide came in, the Moken children splashed around in the water, diving down to pick up food that lay metres below what Gislen or her daughter could see. &ldquo;They had their eyes wide open, fishing for clams, shells and sea cucumbers, with no problem at all,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Gislen <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982203002902\">set up an experiment</a> to test just how good the children&rsquo;s underwater vision really was. The kids were excited about joining in, says Gislen, &ldquo;they thought it was just a fun game.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03l2g0p\"}}</p><p>The kids had to dive underwater and place their heads onto a panel. From there they could see a card displaying either vertical or horizontal lines. Once they had stared at the card, they came back to the surface to report which direction the lines travelled. Each time they dived down, the lines would get thinner, making the task harder. It turned out that the Moken children were able to see twice as well as European children who performed the same experiment at a later date.</p><p>What was going on? To see clearly above land, you need to be able to refract light that enters the eye onto the retina. The retina sits at the back of the eye and contains specialised cells, which convert the light signals into electrical signals that the brain interprets as images.</p><p>Light is refracted when it enters the human eye because the outer cornea contains water, which makes it slightly denser than the air outside the eye. An internal lens refracts the light even further.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03l7nyc\"}}</p><p>When the eye is immersed in water, which has about the same density as the cornea, we lose the refractive power of the cornea, which is why the image becomes severely blurred.</p><blockquote><p> The Moken children were able to see twice as well as European children </p></blockquote><p>Gislen figured that in order for the Moken children to see clearly underwater, they must have either picked up some adaption that fundamentally changed the way their eyes worked, or they had learned to use their eyes differently under water.</p><p>She thought the first theory was unlikely, because a fundamental change to the eye would probably mean the kids wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see well above water. A simple eye test proved this to be true &ndash; the Moken children could see just as well above water as European children of a similar age.</p><p>It had to be some kind of manipulation of the eye itself, thought Gislen. There are two ways in which you can theoretically improve your vision underwater. You can change the shape of the lens &ndash; which is called accommodation &ndash; or you can make the pupil smaller, thereby <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150727-what-are-the-limits-of-human-vision\">increasing the depth of field</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03l2g9n\"}}</p><p>Their pupil size was easy to measure &ndash; and revealed that they can constrict their pupils to the maximum known limit of human performance. But this alone couldn&rsquo;t fully explain the degree to which their sight improved. This led Gislen to believe that accommodation of the lens was also involved.</p><p>&ldquo;We had to make a mathematical calculation to work out how much the lens was accommodating in order for them to see as far as they could,&rdquo; says Gislen. This showed that the children had to be able to accommodate to a far greater degree than you would expect to see underwater.</p><blockquote><p> Moken children are able to make their pupils smaller and change their lens shape. Seals and dolphins have a similar adaptation </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Normally when you go underwater, everything is so blurry that the eye doesn&rsquo;t even try to accommodate, it&rsquo;s not a normal reflex,&rdquo; says Gislen. &ldquo;But the Moken children are able to do both &ndash; they can make their pupils smaller and change their lens shape. Seals and dolphins have a similar adaptation.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03l2gms\"}}</p><p>Gislen was able to test a few Moken adults in the same way. They showed no unusual underwater vision or accommodation &ndash; perhaps explaining why the adults in the tribe caught most of their food by spear fishing above the surface. &ldquo;When we age, our lenses become less flexible, so it makes sense that the adults lose the ability to accommodate underwater,&rdquo; says Gislen.</p><blockquote><p> The adults have lost the ability to see underwater because their lenses are less flexible </p></blockquote><p>Gislen wondered whether the Moken children had a genetic anomaly to thank for their ability to see underwater or whether it was just down to practice. To find out, she asked a group of European children on holiday in Thailand, and a group of children in Sweden to take part in training sessions, in which they dived underwater and tried to work out the direction of lines on a card. After 11 sessions across one month, both groups had <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698906002367\">attained the same underwater acuity as the Moken children</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;It was different for each child, but at some point their vision would just suddenly improve,&rdquo; says Gislen. &ldquo;I asked them whether they were doing anything different and they said, &lsquo;No, I can just see better now&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03l7nz4\"}}</p><p>She did notice, however, that the European kids would experience red eyes, irritated by the salt in the water, whereas the Moken children appeared to have no such problem. &ldquo;So perhaps there is some adaptation there that allows them to dive down 30 times without any irritation,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Gislen recently returned to Thailand to visit the Moken tribes, but things had changed dramatically. In 2004, a tsunami created by a giant earthquake within the Indian Ocean destroyed much of the Moken&rsquo;s homeland. Since then, the Thai government has worked hard to move them onto the land, building homes that are further inland and employing members of the tribe to work in the National Park. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo; says Gislen. &ldquo;You want to help keep people safe and give them the best parts of modern culture, but in doing so they lose their own culture.&rdquo;</p><p>In unpublished work, Gislen tested the same kids that were in her original experiment. The Moken children, now in their late teens, were still able to see clearly underwater. She wasn&rsquo;t able to test many adults as they were too shy, but she is certain that they would have lost the ability to see underwater as they got older. &ldquo;The adult eye just isn&rsquo;t capable of that amount of accommodation,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Unfortunately, the children in Gislen&rsquo;s experiments may be the last of the tribe to possess the ability to see so clearly underwater. &ldquo;They just don&rsquo;t spend as much time in the sea anymore,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;so I doubt that any of the children that grow up these days in the tribe have this extraordinary vision.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Join 500,000+ Future fans by liking us on</em> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>, or follow us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a><em>, </em><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\">LinkedIn</a> </strong></em><em>and </em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/\"><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, </em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><em>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</em></a><em>, called &ldquo;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&rdquo;.

At first, Fu thought the woman was an extreme morning lark <em>&ndash;</em> a person who goes to bed early and wakes early. However, the woman explained that she actually went to bed around midnight and woke at 4am feeling completely alert. It was the same for several members of her family, she said.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> She went to bed around midnight and woke at 4am feeling completely alert </p></blockquote><p>Fu and her colleagues compared the genome of different family members. They <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884988/\">discovered a tiny mutation in a gene called DEC2</a> that was present in those who were short-sleepers, but not in members of the family who had normal length sleep, nor in 250 unrelated volunteers.</p><p>When the team bred mice to express this same mutation, the rodents also slept less but performed just as well as regular mice when given physical and cognitive tasks.</p><p>Getting too little sleep normally has a significant impact on health, quality of life and life expectancy.

Most of these had insomnia, she says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not focusing on those people who have sleeping issues that make them sleep less, we wanted to focus on people who sleep for a few hours and feel great.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> I always feel great when I wake up - Abby Ross </p></blockquote><p>A positive outlook is common among all of the short-sleepers that Fu has studied. &ldquo;Anecdotally,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;they are all very energetic, very optimistic. It&rsquo;s very common for them to feel like they want to cram as much into life as they can, but we&rsquo;re not sure how or whether this is related to their mutations.&rdquo;</p><p>Ross would seem to fit that mould. &ldquo;I always feel great when I wake up,&rdquo; she says. She has been living on four to five hours sleep every day for as long as she can remember.</p><p>&ldquo;Those hours in the morning &ndash; around five o&rsquo;clock &ndash; are just fabulous. It&rsquo;s so peaceful and quiet and you can get so much done. I wish more shops were open at that time, but I can shop online, or I can read &ndash; oh there&rsquo;s so much to read in this world! Or I can go out and exercise before anyone else is up, or talk to people in other time zones.&rdquo;</p><p>Her short sleeping patterns allowed her to complete university in two and a half years, as well as affording her time to learn lots of new skills. For example, just three weeks after giving birth to her first son, Ross decided to use one of her early mornings to attempt to run around the block. It took her 10 minutes. The following day she did it again, running a little further. She slowly increased the time she ran, finally completing not one, but 37 marathons &ndash; one a month over three years &ndash; plus several ultramarathons. &ldquo;I can get up and do my exercise before anyone else is up and then it&rsquo;s done, out of the way,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wfjkr\"}}</p><p>As a child, Ross remembers spending very early mornings with her dad, another short-sleeper. &ldquo;Our early mornings gave us such a special time together,&rdquo; she says. Now, if she ever oversleeps &ndash; which she says has only ever happened a handful of times, her husband thinks she&rsquo;s dead. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t lay in, I&rsquo;d feel terrible if I did,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Take a shortcut</strong></p><p>Fu has subsequently sequenced the genomes of several other families who fit the criteria of short-sleepers. They&rsquo;re only just beginning to understand the gene mutations that lead to this talent, but in principle, she says, it might one day be possible to enable short sleeping in others.</p><blockquote><p> The most effective way to improve your sleep is to fix your wake-up time in the morning </p></blockquote><p>Until then, are there any shortcuts to a more efficient night&rsquo;s sleep for the rest of us?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thesleepconsultancy.com/index_files/WhoamI.htm\">Neil Stanley</a>, an independent sleep consultant, says yes: &ldquo;The most effective way to improve your sleep is to fix your wake-up time in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Stanley says that when your body gets used to the time it needs to wake up, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v397/n6714/full/397029a0.html\">it can use the time it has to sleep as efficiently as possible</a>. &ldquo;Studies show that your body prepares to wake up one and a half hours prior to actually waking up. Your body craves regularity, so if you chop and change your sleep pattern, your body hasn&rsquo;t got a clue when it should prepare to wake up or not.&rdquo;</p><p>You could also do yourself a favour by ignoring society&rsquo;s views on sleep, he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this social view that short sleeping is a good thing and should be encouraged &ndash; we&rsquo;re always hauling out the example of Margaret Thatcher and top CEOs who don&rsquo;t need much sleep. In fact, the amount of sleep you need is genetically determined as much as your height or shoe size. Some people need very little sleep, others need 11 or 12 hours to feel their best.&rdquo;</p><p>Stanley says that a lot of people with sleep issues actually don&rsquo;t have any problem sleeping, instead they have an expectation that they need to sleep for a certain amount of time. &ldquo;If we could all figure out what kind of sleeper we are, and live our life accordingly, that would make a huge difference to our quality of life,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Follow us <em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-07-07T00:19:19Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The people who need very little sleep","HeadlineShort":"The people who barely sleep","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Is it true that some people need only a few hours of sleep?

Others describe it as like a bomb going off next to their head as they fall asleep. Sometimes it occurs just once in a lifetime, for others it happens multiple times a night.</p><p>The physician Silas Weir Mitchell first described the disorder in 1876, when he described two men who suffered from what he called &ldquo;sensory discharges&rdquo; &ndash; the men themselves described it as hearing &ldquo;loud bells&rdquo; or a &ldquo;gunshot&rdquo; that would wake them from sleep. But despite its provocative and intriguing name, there has been relatively little research into the disorder. There's now a theory, however, that the condition and related sleep disturbances may help explain apparently unrelated cultural phenomena, specifically the&nbsp;origins of alien abductions, government conspiracy theories, and supernatural demons.&nbsp;</p><p>So what do we know about this nocturnal experience? Well, it may not be as rare as you might think. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25773787\">a study published last month</a>, 211 students were asked whether they had ever experienced the condition &ndash; 18% said yes. However, this sample is probably not reflective of its true prevalence since students are prone to lack of sleep &ndash; a factor known to increase the risk of experiencing the phenomenon.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ns7x8\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;If you have any sort of sleep disruption like insomnia or jetlag, then you might be more likely to experience the condition,&rdquo; says <a href=\"http://www.briansharpless.com\">Brian Sharpless</a>, assistant professor of psychology at Washington State University, who led the study. &ldquo;Stress and emotional tension are also associated with an increased occurrence.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Sudden shut down<br /> </strong><br /> Theories about the cause of an exploding head are speculative, says Sharpless. Several ideas have been proposed, including ear disorders and partial epileptic seizures. But the most compelling theory comes from a handful of studies in which people with the condition have had their brain activity monitored overnight. These small studies suggest that there may be a <a href=\"http://journal.sleepnet.or.kr/journal/view.php?doi=10.13078/jksrs.11011\">burst of neural activity</a> in the brain that coincides with the reported explosion.</p><p>Normally, when we go to sleep our body shuts down and becomes paralysed so that we don&rsquo;t act out our dreams. During this transition from wake to sleep, the brain usually turns off bit by bit, says Sharpless. <br />However, in exploding head syndrome, there is a hiccup in the 'reticular formation' &ndash; the part of the brain responsible for overseeing this general shut-down &ndash; which results in a delay in switching off some areas.&nbsp;</p><p>This delay is associated with a suppression of alpha brainwaves that are normally responsible for drowsiness, and a sudden burst of neural activity in the areas of the brain responsible for processing sound.&nbsp;&ldquo;We think the neurons are all firing at once,&rdquo; he says, which results in the sensation of an explosion in your head.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ns82g\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;This theory makes sense to me,&rdquo; says Nielsen. &ldquo;It has always felt electrical in its nature. The sensation of an explosion is accompanied with a very loud sound in both my ears, as if you&rsquo;ve crossed two wires in a circuit and zapped them together.&rdquo;</p><p>Sharpless says some people also feel an aura of electrical sensations that moves from the lower torso to the head, immediately before the explosion strikes. &ldquo;It feels like an electric shock,&rdquo; says Nielsen. &ldquo;You can feel the current passing through you.&rdquo;</p><p>While there is no cure-all treatment, antidepressants reduce occurrence, as do relaxation and stress-busting techniques. &ldquo;You can help a lot just by reassuring a person that they&rsquo;re not crazy or experiencing symptoms of a tumour or some other brain disorder,&rdquo; says Sharpless.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ns7pv\"}}</p><p>But what has this got to do with alien abductions and supernatural beings? Exploding head syndrome is often linked with sleep paralysis &ndash; people who experience one often experience the other. Sleep paralysis is another spooky sleep disorder in which you <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15402002.2014.963583#.VRxPw1PF_PE\">feel like you are awake but you can&rsquo;t move your body</a>. Sharpless thinks that the two could explain several apparently supernatural events.</p><p>Both sleep paralysis and exploding head syndrome appear to share an underlying problem in the transition between wakefulness and sleep. In sleep paralysis, parts of your brain are in REM sleep &ndash; the time in which we dream the most &ndash; while other parts of your consciousness have woken up. &ldquo;So you get the body paralysis and the dream content of REM sleep, but you&rsquo;re conscious,&rdquo; says Sharpless. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like having a dream while you&rsquo;re awake. The scary thing is that you hear things and feel things as real as they are during the day, but what&rsquo;s going on is completely hallucinatory.&rdquo;</p><p>Consider the case of Haruko Matsuda (not her real name), a young Japanese woman, who often experiences sleep paralysis. She described a typical night to Sharpless: &ldquo;I felt something push on my chest so I opened my eyes. I heard someone yelling&hellip; and it sounded like it was coming from right beside my ear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought it was a ghost or something. It was yelling &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna kill you!&rsquo;. I couldn&rsquo;t move, and I was so scared&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ns7ty\"}}</p><p>In the Middle Ages, Matsuda&rsquo;s symptoms could have been attributed to male or female demons &ndash; incubi and succubi &ndash; who would sit on people&rsquo;s chests and seduce them into having sexual intercourse. More recently, people apparently frozen and dazzled during the night have blamed the experience on alien abduction.</p><p>Take a look at these supernatural or alien stories, says Sharpless, and sometimes you can see hints of both sleep paralysis and exploding head syndrome. &ldquo;People can sense these strange explosions in their head, and they may think they&rsquo;ve had something implanted in their brain. Or they feel this surge of electricity and they think they&rsquo;ve been shot by some kind of new energy weapon. They can&rsquo;t move, but hear and see strange things and think they&rsquo;ve been abducted.&rdquo;</p><p>Nielsen, who is now a psychiatrist, says he has had episodes of exploding head syndrome every few months since he was 10 years old, and has experienced sleep paralysis twice &ndash; but his scientific mind helped prevent any anxiety over them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a tendency to think about things scientifically, so even as a teenager I explained it to myself as &lsquo;oh something electrical is happening in my brain&rsquo;, without making too much out of it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t bother me at all, but if someone already has a tendency to wonder about paranormal things, I can definitely see how they could gravitate towards a supernatural explanation.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p>It feels electrical... accompanied by a very loud sound</p></blockquote>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"‘I have exploding head syndrome’","HeadlineShort":"‘I have exploding head syndrome’","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"It’s strange, unpleasant and surprisingly common.

What&rsquo;s it like to live with this odd condition? And if it turns out that many people are being mistaken for alcohol-abusers by everyone from their friends to the courts, what should we do about it?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lb25y\"}}</p><p>Evidence of experiences like Hess&rsquo;s can be traced back to the 1970s, when researchers in Japan described a mysterious condition in patients with chronic yeast infections. In papers published at the time, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1027959\">researchers describe</a>d how all of these patients had an abnormal liver enzyme, which meant that they weren&rsquo;t great at getting rid of alcohol from the body.</p><p>Everyone has a little bit of yeast in their guts, and when it interacts with carbohydrates and sugar from our food, it produces tiny amounts of alcohol. In the case of the Japanese patients, the extra yeast from the infection and the fact they ate lots of carbohydrate-rich rice, combined with the abnormal liver enzyme, meant they couldn&rsquo;t process the alcohol quick enough.</p><p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.panola.edu/programs/health-sciences/associate-degree-nursing/adn-faculty-staff.html\">Barbara Cordell</a>, head of nursing and health sciences at Panola College in Texas, who is investigating the condition. She and her colleague Justin McCarthy, were the first to identify the disorder in an otherwise healthy individual in the US, and verify it in a controlled environment. Her interest began in 2005 after a friend of hers &ndash; let&rsquo;s call him Joe &ndash; began experiencing symptoms of drunkenness. He was dizzy, nauseous and moaned of exhaustion &ndash; just like you feel after a night on the tiles &ndash; &nbsp;despite claiming that he hadn&rsquo;t touched a drop of the hard stuff.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lb2nz\"}}</p><p>His wife began taking notes each time it happened. On one occasion, Cordell remembers sitting around a table with the two of them and their son, administering a breathalyser test. They all drank a glass of wine and took another test. Joe&rsquo;s result was three times higher than any of the others around the table.</p><p>&ldquo;It was so mysterious, just completely baffling&rdquo; Cordell says. The problem continued to get worse and by 2010 Joe was having two to three episodes of spontaneous drunkenness a week.</p><p><strong>Belly brewery<br /> </strong><br /> In January that year, Joe was admitted to hospital under strict 24-hour observation. Doctors, suspicious that Joe was just a closet alcoholic, inspected his belongings to check he hadn&rsquo;t smuggled in any alcohol, and nobody but the doctors and nurses were allowed access to him during his stay. Joe was fed a high carbohydrate diet throughout the day and blood was drawn every two hours. At one point during the afternoon Joe&rsquo;s blood alcohol levels rose to 120 mg per 100 ml of blood &ndash; for an average sized man, that&rsquo;s the equivalent of having drunk seven shots of whisky.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lb1x0\"}}</p><p>Joe was fortunate to know a researcher who could investigate his condition, but Hess wasn&rsquo;t so lucky. He suffered for years, and he had almost given up hope. He&rsquo;d seen every doctor in the book, had every colonoscopy, endoscopy, and liver function test they could give him. Luckily, his wife persevered and in the dead of the night came across some information Cordell had written about Joe and his weird condition online.</p><p>They got in touch with her and another doctor, Anup Kanodia, who were both now working on auto-brewery syndrome. Kanodia analysed Hess&rsquo;s stool samples, and performed genetic and microbial tests to help clarify what was going on in his gut. &ldquo;He had 400% more yeast in his gut than he should do,&rdquo; says Kanodia. &ldquo;It was the highest amount of yeast I&rsquo;ve ever seen in one person in my entire career.&rdquo;</p><p>Since then, about 50 people have come forward claiming to have a similar condition, although Cordell expects the true number of cases in the US might be double that.<br /> <strong><br /> </strong>The problem is, rarely do any of these people have the abnormal liver enzyme that you see in the Japanese case studies. So what&rsquo;s going on? Cordell explains their current working theory: &ldquo;The problem arises when the yeast in our gut gets out of hand. Bacteria normally keep the yeast in check, but sometimes the yeast takes over.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lb29n\"}}</p><p>When you look at the gut environment of people with auto-brewery syndrome you always find abnormally large numbers of yeast, most commonly a strain called <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> - what beer makers call &ldquo;brewers yeast&rdquo;.</p><p>She says that often these people can pinpoint the start of the condition and find it coincides with a period of long-term antibiotic use. It&rsquo;s likely that this wipes out their bacteria for a sustained period of time, giving the yeast a chance to take hold. It&rsquo;s not yet clear though, she says, why we don&rsquo;t see this problem happening more often when people are on antibiotics for a long time.<br /> <strong><br /> In the dock</p><p></strong>Forensic toxicologist <a href=\"http://www.borkensteincourse.org/\">Wayne Jones</a> needs a little more persuading. He recently retired from the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine in Link&ouml;ping, Sweden, after 40 years of medical experience,. He says that any alcohol that we produce in the gut through the breakdown of carbohydrates has to pass through the liver before it comes out into the blood circulation. In the liver, we have enzymes that process alcohol so that almost all of it is removed from the blood, so-called first-pass metabolism.</p><p>Because of this process, Jones is not yet convinced that people can produce enough alcohol in their blood merely from a yeast imbalance alone to have any medical or forensic significance &ndash; aside from the few exceptional cases in Japan. &ldquo;Those are the only cases I know that have any substance,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>He&rsquo;s given this opinion <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10976182\">in court</a> on several occasions as an expert witness in cases where a lawyer of a defendant caught drink-driving has claimed that their client has undiagnosed auto-brewery syndrome. &ldquo;Several people over the years have claimed that the alcohol measured in their blood wasn&rsquo;t caused by drinking beer, whisky or wine but by the body itself,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lb0kx\"}}</p><p>A couple of years ago in Sweden, one such defense was accepted for the first time by a judge in the lower courts. The prosecution appealed, however, and Jones was asked to step in to give evidence. The driver was later found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol.</p><p>Hess himself is currently attempting to appeal a drink-driving charge he received in Hawaii, which he blames on his condition.</p><p>I showed Jones the most <a href=\"http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=33912#.VMdZR4qsU40\">recent paper</a> written by Cordell about her friend Joe&rsquo;s stay in hospital. He said he&rsquo;d like to see more information reported about the methods that the doctors used to measure alcohol in the patient&rsquo;s blood, and how much carbohydrates he was fed. He would also like to see studies on the time-course of formation and degradation of this gut-produced alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't want to say that the study by Cordell is wrong, but I would like to see much more detailed information before I accept the findings as a proven fact,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Cordell acknowledges that much more research needs to be done. She&rsquo;d like to do genetic and further metabolic analysis of her patients, for starters. &ldquo;Ultimately, I&rsquo;d just like doctors to keep an open mind if someone comes to them with these symptoms,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>For Hess and Joe, anti-fungal drugs and a diet low in carbohydrates and sugar have helped them to mitigate most of their symptoms. &ldquo;I still have one or two episodes a month,&rdquo; says Hess, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s nowhere near as bad as it was. I have my wife to thank for that. She carried on searching for an answer when I was ready to give up. I&rsquo;m so grateful to her.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p>It was the highest amount of yeast I&rsquo;ve ever seen in one person</p></blockquote>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-05T11:29:19Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The man who gets drunk on chips","HeadlineShort":"The man who gets drunk on chips","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"A few people become inebriated simply by eating carbohydrates – what’s going on in the body?

                            <p>Soon after Suzanne O&rsquo;Sullivan had left medical school in Dublin, she met a patient named Yvonne, whose mysterious illness appeared to bear little relation to any of her previous studies.</p><p>Yvonne, she was told, had been stacking the fridges in a supermarket when a colleague had accidentally sprayed a fine mist of window cleaner in her face. She tried to wash her eyes, left work and went to bed early, hoping they would feel less sore the next day. But when she woke up, her vision was worse &ndash; everything was so blurry she struggled to read the time on the clock. Twenty-four hours later, she could not tell night from day.</p><blockquote><p> O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s colleagues assumed Yvonne was faking it, perhaps for some kind of lawsuit. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no Oscar for that performance,&rdquo; one muttered </p></blockquote><p>Except after six months of examinations, doctors could find nothing wrong with Yvonne&rsquo;s eyes. She was eventually admitted to the neurology unit where O&rsquo;Sullivan was working. During the observations, Yvonne&rsquo;s eyes would flicker between her husband and the doctors; as the consultant moved an ophthalmoscope close to her eyes, she blinked. It certainly seemed like her eyes were responding to her surroundings, yet she continued to claim that she was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.</p><p>O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s colleagues assumed she was faking it, perhaps for some kind of lawsuit. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no Oscar for that performance,&rdquo; one muttered after they had left the ward. O&rsquo;Sullivan herself was unconvinced. &ldquo;I liked Yvonne. I felt sorry for her. But I did not believe she was blind,&rdquo; she writes in her new book It&rsquo;s All in Your Head, recently shortlisted for the <a href="http://wellcomebookprize.org/">Wellcome Book Prize</a>.</p><p>Now she knows better. At the Royal London Hospital she has become an expert in &ldquo;psychosomatic&rdquo; illnesses. She has treated people who are paralysed from the waist down, or who have such severe cramp in their fingers that their hand has become little more than a claw; one woman could not even empty her bladder without a medical catheter. Yet when doctors look, they can find no physiological cause &ndash; suggesting the problem originates in the mind, not the body.</p><p>In this light, it&rsquo;s perfectly possible that Yvonne really wasn&rsquo;t conscious of what she was seeing &ndash; somehow, her unconscious mind was discarding the information before she became aware of it.</p><p>Keen to know more, I spoke to O&rsquo;Sullivan about her career and her recent book detailing these remarkable case studies.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Although O&rsquo;Sullivan had seen patients like Yvonne from the very beginning of her career, the interest intensified once she started specialising in epilepsy. Patients would often come to her suffering from debilitating seizures that left them writhing around on the floor, limbs flailing, helpless, yet when they came in to the hospital for neurological tests, they showed none of the signature brain activity of epilepsy; they were &ldquo;psychogenic&rdquo; seizures. &ldquo;It became obvious no one is talking about these problems that are consistently common, but which are getting no attention in medical journals or medical conferences,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This is a very neglected area.&rdquo;</p><p>That silence brings stigma, meaning that most patients end up feeling insulted by the diagnosis. &ldquo;Their first reaction is &lsquo;you think I&rsquo;m doing it on purpose&rsquo; or &lsquo;you think it&rsquo;s not real&rsquo; or &lsquo;I could stop it if wanted&rsquo;,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this perception that there is a degree of wilfulness&rdquo;.</p><p>If you find their symptoms hard to believe, consider the many profound ways that your emotions already move your body. O&rsquo;Sullivan points out that every time we cry, or laugh, or shake with anger, if we feel so sad that it is hard to lift ourselves from our bed, or queasy with nausea after we hear of a friend&rsquo;s food poisoning, then we are experiencing psychosomatic phenomena first-hand. In fact, up to 30% of people visiting their family doctor or GP (and 50% of women seeing their gynaecologist) are enduring symptoms that cannot be explained with a physical cause &ndash; suggesting they may be psychosomatic in origin. The difference is that for most of us those feelings pass and we can return to our normal lives, but for O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s patients they are exaggerated and chronic, lasting months, years, even a lifetime.</p><blockquote><p> They really are disabled. They are more disabled than most people with a physical disease </p></blockquote><p>She emphasises that the psychological origin does not make the blindness, fatigue, seizures or paralysis any less debilitating. &ldquo;They really are disabled. They are more disabled than most people with a physical disease.&rdquo;</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Consider Camilla, a lawyer in London, who had been diagnosed with epilepsy before O&rsquo;Sullivan managed to show that it was psychogenic. She described how humiliating she found the seizures; how people try to help by sitting on her to stop her limbs from flailing about, and stick their fingers down her throat to stop her choking; one man knelt beside her, asking if she was OK, before stealing her mobile phone. &ldquo;But do you know what happens all the time? People video me on their mobile phones and walk away laughing,&rdquo; she told O&rsquo;Sullivan. The more you know about these patients, the harder it is to believe that anyone would deliberately expose themselves to this humiliation.</p><p>O&rsquo;Sullivan has nevertheless met a few fakers, such as Judith, who claimed to be suffering seizures as the side-effect of chemotherapy for leukaemia years before. Hoping to get to the bottom of the story, O&rsquo;Sullivan called her into a hospital ward, where a video camera could film a seizure when or if it occurred. Sure enough, at 9:15 in the evening, a nurse found Judith lying on the floor unconscious, falling so hard that she had apparently fractured her hand. When O&rsquo;Sullivan played back the video, however, she saw there had been no seizure at all. Judith had simply raised her hand and hit it hard against the wall four times, before lying down gently on the floor, pulling down a plate with her to attract the nurse. Indeed, looking at the medical records, it became clear that Judith had never suffered from leukaemia, either.</p><blockquote><p> What kind of mental torment would make someone invent an illness? </p></blockquote><p>Although such patients with &ldquo;factitious&rdquo; illnesses may add to the stigma of people like Camilla or Yvonne, O&rsquo;Sullivan still feels compassion for these people. After all, what kind of mental torment would make someone behave in this way? Even if Judith hadn&rsquo;t suffered from leukaemia, perhaps she had witnessed it in someone else &ndash; an experience she found difficult to process in any other way? &ldquo;Factitious illness is one of most serious disorders I know,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>There is currently precious little research on the best way to treat psychosomatic illness, but she tends to refer her patients to psychiatrists or to a cognitive behavioural therapist (CBT) who might be able to unknot the distress or trauma that is leading to the illness.</p><p>And there are some real success stories. Not all cases can be pinned to a specific event, but Camilla realised that her seizures may have been linked to the death of her young son, setting her on the path to recovery. Yvonne, meanwhile, seemed to have been struggling to juggle the stresses of work, children, and an overbearing husband, and as she learned to cope with those upsets, her sight slowly returned.</p><p>Patients with paralysis or muscle spasms can also respond well to physiotherapy. &ldquo;They need to learn how to use their legs again,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says. It&rsquo;s often an uphill struggle; particularly with seizures, relapse is common. &ldquo;We have to give ongoing support and reassurance.&rdquo;</p><p>One of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s biggest concerns is the rate of misdiagnosis &ndash; doctors overlooking the psychological origin of these illnesses, instead prescribing the patients drugs, or even admitting them for harmful surgery. She says this may come from the doctors&rsquo; fear; somehow, it seems more serious missing a physical cause of an illness than a psychological cause &ndash; yet the damage can be just as great.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>&ldquo;The people who have been told they have epilepsy &ndash; they will be put on a toxic medication for at least a couple of years, before they accept it&rsquo;s not going to work.&rdquo; Over that time, the condition has become a part of the patients&rsquo; life &ndash; they&rsquo;ve told their friends, families, and employer, making it much harder to accept the new diagnosis. &ldquo;You become wedded to it through your own belief and the doctor&rsquo;s belief,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan says. &ldquo;You are getting treatment you don&rsquo;t need for a disease you don&rsquo;t have, and you are deprived of the treatment you do need &ndash; you&rsquo;re not referred for CBT, a physiotherapist or a psychiatrist.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps inspired by meeting Yvonne at the start of her career, she would like to raise awareness of psychosomatic illnesses at the earliest stages of a doctor&rsquo;s training. &ldquo;My feeling is that it needs to start at medical school-level,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I must have encountered these patients thousands of times but I have no recollection of being told how I should help them.&rdquo;</p><p>For the time being, she hopes that her book will at least spark that conversation; so far, she has already found that a small number of patients are becoming more accepting of the diagnosis, and are less afraid of the stigma attached to it. &ldquo;I have my fingers crossed that it will be a talking point, that people will feel less ashamed.&rdquo;</p><p>--</p><p><em>David Robson is BBC Future&rsquo;s feature writer.
