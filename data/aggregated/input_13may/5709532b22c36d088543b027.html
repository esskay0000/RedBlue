She turned my life into a living nightmare. Everyone could see she was trying to destroy me. I was living with my grandmother at the time and she was suffering from cancer. The whole thing just spiralled out of control.”<\/p><p>The victim said he was forced to leave his job as a manager at a respected national firm as a result of the attacks. He said: “She was a childish woman who would strop, stamp her feet and cry if she did not get her way. <\/p><p>“Near the end of the relationship I felt scared of her, she would not leave me alone. One night we rowed and I said I would go to the pub so she could calm down. When I turned around she was eating my money to stop me. She had a £10 note in her mouth and swallowed it.”<\/p><p>Magistrate Rachel Lipscomb sentenced Melaugh to a 12-week jail term, suspended for two years, and also imposed an indefinite restraining order preventing her from contacting the victim. <\/p><p>From April last year a law made it illegal to share sexually explicit images without the subject’s consent. The maximum penalty is two years’ jail. <\/p><p>Only two women are believed to have been convicted of revenge pornography so far but in both cases the victims were also women. <\/p><p><inlineElement refid=\"6860580\" type=\"manualArticleList\"/> <\/p>","articleMainMedia":{"imageMainPosition":"","image":{"altText":"n","caption":"Saleswoman Ellie Melaugh was handed a two-year suspended jail term and a restraining order","credit":"","copyright":"Alamy","orientation":"landscape","url":{"defaultURL":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/02789/court_main_2789595a.jpg","portrait":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/02789/court_main_2789595ap.jpg","landscape":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/02789/court_main_2789595al.jpg"}}},"articleInlineMedia":[{"refid":6860580,"type":"manualArticleList","title":"NOW READ","manualArticleListData":[{"id":1,"articleId":7060245,"teaserTemplate":"","sectionColour":"00745e","sectionName":"UFC","sectionUrl":"/sol/homepage/sport/ufc/","articleUrl":"/sol/homepage/sport/ufc/7060245/EXCLUSIVE-UFC-targeting-UK-return-by-the-end-of-the-year.html","articleTimestamp":1460136229680,"articleType":"article","articleData":{"teaserHeadline1x1":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText1x1":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline1x2":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText1x2":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline1x3":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText1x3":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline2x1":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText2x1":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline2x2":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText2x2":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline2x3":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText2x3":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline3x2":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText3x2":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline3x3":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText3x3":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","teaserHeadline":"UFC targeting UK return by the end of the year","teaserText":"<b class=\"red\">EXCLUSIVE:<\/b> UFC EMEA chief James Elliott confirms the UFC are planning events in Germany and the UK to round off 2016","image":{"altText":"Main Image","caption":"Hoping for a UK return: UFC EMEA chief James Elliott","credit":"","copyright":"UFC","orientation":"landscape","url":{"defaultURL":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/02788/01_08134331_64ca59_2788150a.jpg","portrait":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/02788/01_08134331_64ca5_2788150ap.jpg","landscape":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/02788/01_08134331_64ca5_2788150al.jpg"}}}},{"id":2,"articleId":7060063,"teaserTemplate":"","sectionColour":"00745e","sectionName":"Sport","sectionUrl":"/sol/homepage/sport/","articleUrl":"/sol/homepage/sport/7060063/WOW-Stand-by-for-the-biggest-super-duper-weekend-of-sporting-actionever.html","articleTimestamp":1460124019863,"articleType":"article","articleData":{"teaserHeadline1x1":"WOW!
