Donald TrumpâsÂ formal foreign-policy addressÂ last week hurled a stick into the hive of the foreign-policy establishment. Republican and Democrat foreign-policy mavens erupted and buzzed around to attack the intruder. Anyone not reading the text would think it was a contradictory spewing of nonsense, another in the long line of Trump outrages. In fact, the reaction to the speech was far more revealing than Trumpâs address itself.

Each week we cross-post an excerpt from Katrina vanden Heuvelâs column at the WashingtonPost.com. Read the full text of Katrinaâs column here.

The Clinton campaign brought out former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) to respond. Albright, aÂ supporterÂ of Bushâs Iraq debacle and promoter of America as an âindispensable nation,â scornfully announced that she was âhoping for something that made sense.â Kaine termed Trumpâs use of the words âAmerica Firstâdisqualifying. NeoconservativesÂ Bill KristolÂ andÂ Charles KrauthammerÂ damned it for echoing President Obamaâs foreign policy. The Washington Post editorial boardÂ dismissed Trumpâs argumentÂ as âloose, frequently contradictory and embedded in a bucket of falsehoods,â suggesting it reflected the âisolationism of Robert A. Taftâ and Pat Buchananâs âfondness for authoritarian regimes.â		
Trumpâs speech did recycle many of the lies that Republicans routinely tell about Obamaâs foreign policy. He accused Obama of apologizing to enemies and alienating friends. He called the Iran nuclear deal a disgrace and wrongly claimed Iran is violating it. He postured that Obamaâs failure to enforce the âline in the sand in Syriaâ was a measure of weakness. He charged Obama with mistreating Israel, gutting missile defense and abandoning Poland and the Czech Republic. Although Trump read from a teleprompter, the prepared speech didnât cover up the shallowness of his understanding.
