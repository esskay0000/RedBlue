A San Diego-area congressman is cutting short a trip to Israel to rectify an epic fail on campaign finance reports â including money spent on video games.

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told The San Diego Union-Tribune that "no taxpayer money" was involved in seemingly personal expenses that include travel and his children's school.

The Federal Election Commission is questioning some of Hunter's reported expenses, includingÂ more than 60 video game transactions totaling $1,302.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reports:



"Hunter said he and his wife were the only two holders of his campaignâs credit card, which incurred most of the expenses. As of Thursday morning, he said, he is now the only card-holder. ...

"Campaign finance reports show $5,339 in such charges during 2015 alone: $1,128 in travel, $1,650 to Hunterâs children's school in El Cajon, $1,424 for video games and $1,137 paid to an oral and facial surgeon."
