Donald Trump offered some campaign adviceÂ to Bernie Sanders, as the Vermont senator's chances of winning the Democratic presidential nomination grow increasingly slim: run as an independent.

Trump tweeted on Tuesday that Sanders "has been treated terribly by the Democrats â both with delegates & otherwise."

He added: "He should show them, and run as an Independent!"

Presumably, Trump was referring to the Democratic Party's use of superdelegates in its nomination process, who are party leaders and elected officials free to support any candidate regardless of primary results. So far, they've overwhelmingly favored Sanders' rival, Hillary Clinton, who also leads among pledged delegates.Â SandersÂ has also criticized the Democratic National Committee over a fundraising agreement with Clinton's campaign.

Trump in recent days hasÂ blasted the Republican Party delegate selection process as "crooked" and "rigged," as rival Ted Cruz has continued to accumulate delegates at the state and local level who could back him on later ballots at the Republican National Convention in July should Trump not lock up the nomination on the first ballot.

However, while Trump may genuinely feel some empathy for Sanders, the potential benefits to Trump ofÂ a Sanders independent candidacy are fairly self-evident, as the Vermont senator would figure to peel away support from Clinton in November if he were also on the ballot. While Sanders, a longtime independent, has said he'll take his campaign to the convention and has indicated the enthusiasm he'd have for Clinton's nomination would depend on her platform, there's no sign he's mulling what Trump suggestedÂ â much to Trump's chagrin, no doubt.
