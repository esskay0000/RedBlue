I am answering questions from the penthouse in our new building!

Posted by Chris Cillizza onÂ Friday, April 8, 2016

Â 

If you like extreme close-ups of my face, talking about politics (and professional wrestling) and Facebook, man do I have the #content for you!

I took questions in a Facebook Live for 21 minutes Friday afternoon; it markedÂ my inaugural adventure into the wonderful world of live-streaming on Facebook. My plan is to make this a regular thing; every Friday at 1 pm (or so) eastern time, I will go live on my Facebook page to answer questions (and tour people around the new WaPo building). Just check my Facebook page around that time every Friday to see the magic happen.
