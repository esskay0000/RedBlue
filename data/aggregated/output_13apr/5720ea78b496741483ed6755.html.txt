Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma overtook Dalian Wanda Group Co.âs Wang Jianlin as Asiaâs richest man after the e-commerce giantâs financial affiliate raised a record amount in its latest round of fundraising.

Ma added $4.3 billion to his fortune on Tuesday after his Ant Financialâs latest deal, expanding his wealth to $33.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That puts him ahead of Wangâs $32.7 billion and Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shingâs $29.5 billion.

Maâs lead among Asiaâs billionaires could be short lived as Wang reorganizes his entertainment business and seeks to relocate his property unitâs listing in search of higher valuations in mainland China -- deals that could affect the property-to-entertainment mogulâs fortune.

Alibabaâs billionaire chairman owns 6.3 percent of Alibaba and 37.9 percent of Ant Financial, whose full name is Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co., after the fundraising. Ma is also said to be planning to take Ant Financial public in what could be Chinaâs largest IPO since 2010.
