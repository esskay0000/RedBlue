Prince was not often identified as a political artist. He was rarely referred to as a protest singer. Yet, in the last year of a remarkable life, he was hailed as a âfunky Pete Seegerâ who amplified the message of the #BlackLivesMatter movement.

There was so much more to Prince Rogers Nelson, who has died unexpectedly at age 57, than politics. But Prince often made bold statements about the issues of his timesâas when he used the song âRonnie Talk to Russiaâ to urge President Ronald Reagan to get serious about nuclear disarmament. And he kept doing so, telling the audience at the 2015 Grammys ceremony that âblack lives… still matter.â				
					
					
Prince embraced controversy, and he sometimes inspired itâTipper Gore formed her music-labeling group, the Parents Music Resource Center, after she found her 12-year-old daughter Karenna listening to his song âDarling Nikki.â Prince broke down barriers, made demands and opened up dialogues in ways that changed lives. Prince referred to his band as The Revolution, argued that âthe gatekeepers must changeâ and championed the ideal of a new power generation. A brilliant musician and performer, he controlled his own career, absolutely and without apology. That allowed him to remain exceptionally engaged with his times, and to respond immediately to tragedy and trauma. He released new songs to benefit New Orleans relief initiatives at a point when officials were still struggling to respond to the 2005 storm.

The son of a jazz pianist and a social worker, Prince rejected categories and stereotypes and invited generations of fans to break through racial, gender, sexual, and musical barriers. If he had an ideology, it was a faith that human beings could achieve unity and transformational change. Indeed, even in the most difficult of circumstances, the Jehovahâs Witness imagined that unityâand the possibility that might extend from it. His response to the killing of Trayvon Martin was to work with his friend Van Jones to develop the #YesWeCode initiative to prepare 100,000 low-income young people for careers writing computer code.				
					
					
Less than a year ago, in May of 2015, Prince released the song âBaltimoreâ as a tribute to Freddie Gray and other African-American men who had died while in police custody. The song, Princeâs spokesman said, a response to âthe slew of killings of young black men.â				
					
					
Referencing Baltimoreâs Freddie Gray and Fergusonâs Michael Brown, Prince sang: âIf there ainât no justice, then there ainât no peace.â				
					
					
âAre we gonna see another bloody day?â he asked, and then he answered: âWeâre tired of the cryinâ and people dyinââLetâs take all the guns away.â

Nice article.  Thank you.

Dear John Nichols,

Thanks for your fine reporting-interpreting in âPrince Recognizedâ¦No Justice, No Peace,â
and for powerfully portraying Prince as an Activist who didnât just protest but acted in powerful
ways to promote Peace and Justice in society and new opportunities for the less chanced in the USA.

What a truly beautiful example of one personâs ability to promote and inspire constructive change over time Prince was. 

Iâm not big on Princeâs riding nude on a motorcycle playing a guitar in his Twin Cities area or his creating doubts about his sexuality and other writ-large publicity stunts or, possibly, apocryphal stories. Iâve never listened to the âDear Nikkiâ that provoked Tipper Gore to start a reform group or movement. And, while I believe MOST Police Departmentâs across America are filled with courageous publics stewards of the public order and safety, I also know and say, âMany other policemen are racist to the core, think black and other less-chanced lives DONâT matter, and they have enjoyed getting away with legal murder, violence, injustice, sadism, and harassment of citizens. They have continued their racist, pro-white, double standards of profiling and focusing on but one small segment of our populationâs criminality, also, unjustly filling our prisons primarily with people of darker hues and making hard lives even harder ever after, negatively affecting them and their families. (Iâm for felons being given their rights of citizenship and participation back if they have served their time and perhaps have remained âcleanâ for a year, say!). It is past time for âlegalâ (especially police) violence, murder, and harassment to be stopped and/or prosecuted! I greatly admire Prince for speaking out and acting effectively. He has used his passionate caring and outstanding showmanship to focus light and attention on this great injustice and betrayal and many others.âBaltimoreââthe song alone-- cries out for something wonderful to be done wherever and whenever some policemen let society, their high calling, and black young men and their families down.

The âthin blue lineâ should be honored more, perhaps paid more, AND definitely held to the highest standards of justice, fairness, decency, and responsibility! And the anomalies should be rooted out quickly. No more legal criminality and racist mischief or worse. Our First Ten Amendment Rights are the rights of all citizens, and our public servants should be about enforcing them for all of us.

Thank you, John Nichols, for a fine article and The Nation for printing it. And thank you, Prince, for an outstanding Example of a beautiful human being and artist acting beautifully and responsively human when it counts! Your influence will live on and more lives will matter because of you!

Sincerely, Rev. J. Roland Cole, 79 yr old retired, so-called âwhite,â UMC clergyman

Well said, Rev... and much appreciated!

âAN INDISPENSABLE VOICE IN OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE.â
