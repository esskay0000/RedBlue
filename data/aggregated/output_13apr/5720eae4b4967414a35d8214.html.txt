âLow-energy Jeb.â âLittle Marco.â âLyinâ Ted.â âCrooked Hillary.â Give Donald Trump credit. He has a memorable way with insults. His have a way of etching themselves on the brain. And theyâve garnered media coverage, analysis, and commentary almost beyond imagining. Memorable as they might be, however, they wonât be what last of Trumpâs 2016 election run. Thatâs surely reserved for a single slogan that will sum up his candidacy when itâs all over (no matter how it ends). He arrived with it on that Trump Tower escalator in the first moments of his campaign and it now headlines his website, where itâs also emblazoned on an array of products from hats to t-shirts.

You already know which line I mean: âMake America Great Again!â With that exclamation point ensuring that you wonât miss the hyperbolic, Trumpian nature of its promise to return the country to its former glory days. In it lies the essence of his campaign, of what heâs promising his followers and Americans generallyâand yet, strangely enough, of all his lines, itâs the one most taken for granted, the one thatâs been given the least thought and analysis. And thatâs a shame, because it represents something new in our American age. The problem, I suspect, is that what first catches the eye is the phrase âMake America Greatâ and then, of course, the exclamation point, while the single most important word in the slogan, historically speaking, is barely noted: âagain.â		
With that âagain,â Donald Trump crossed a line in American politics that, until his escalator moment, represented a kind of psychological taboo for politicians of any stripe, of either party, including presidents and potential candidates for that position. He is the first American leader or potential leader of recent times not to feel the need or obligation to insist that the United States, the âsoleâ superpower of Planet Earth, is an âexceptionalâ nation, an âindispensableâ country, or even in an unqualified sense a âgreatâ one. His claim is the opposite. That, at present, America is anything but exceptional, indispensable, or great, though he alone could make it âgreat again.â In that claim lies a curiosity that, in a court of law, might be considered an admission of guilt. Yes, it says, if one man is allowed to enter the White House in January 2017, this could be a different country, butâand in this lies the originality of the sloganâit is not great now, and in that admission-that-hasnât-been-seen-as-an-admission lies something new on the American landscape.		
Donald Trump, in other words, is the first person to run openly and without apology on a platform of American decline. Think about that for a moment. âMake America Great Again!â is indeed an admission in the form of a boast. As he tells his audiences repeatedly, America, the formerly great, is today a punching bag for China, Mexicoâ¦ well, you know the pitch. You donât have to agree with him on the specifics. Whatâs interesting is the overall vision of a country lacking in its former greatness.		
Perhaps a little history of American greatness and presidents (as well as presidential candidates) is in order here.

âCity Upon a Hillâ
Once upon a time, in a distant America, the words âgreatest,â âexceptional,â and âindispensableâ werenât even part of the political vocabulary. American presidents didnât bother to claim any of them for this country, largely because American wealth and global preeminence were so indisputable. Weâre talking about the 1950s and early 1960s, the post-World War II and pre-Vietnam âgoldenâ years of American power. Despite a certain hysteria about the supposed dangers of domestic communists, few Americans then doubted the singularly unchallengeable power and greatness of the country. It was such a given, in fact, that it was simply too self-evident for presidents to cite, hail, or praise.		
So if you look, for instance, at the speeches of John F. Kennedy, you wonât find them littered with exceptionals, indispensables, or their equivalents. In a pre-inaugural speech he gave in January 1961 on the kind of government he planned to bring to Washington, for instance, he did cite the birth of a âgreat republic,â the United States, and quoted Puritan John Winthrop on the desirability of creating a country that would be âa city upon a hillâ to the rest of the world, with all of humanityâs eyes upon us. In his inaugural address (âAsk not what your country can do for youâ¦â), he invoked a kind of unspoken greatness, saying, âWe shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.â It was then common to speak of the United States with pride as a âfree nationâ (as opposed to the âenslavedâ ones of the communist bloc) rather than an exceptional one. His only use of âgreatâ was to invoke the US- and Soviet Unionâled blocs as âtwo great and powerful groups of nations.â		
Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, âwe must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscientâthat we are only six percent of the worldâs populationâthat we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankindâthat we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversityâand that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.â In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as âa great powerââbut not âthe greatest power.â

If you didnât grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem. Quite the opposite, it implied a deep and abiding confidence in the overwhelming power and presence of this country, a confidence so unshakeable that there was no need to speak of it.

If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider Americaâs movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper, whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. Whatâs striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo.)		
Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, youâre heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it.		
The Reagan Reboot
That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word âagain.â It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled âProuder, Stronger, Better,â its first line ever so memorably went, âItâs morning again in America.â (âWhy would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?â)

Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over âthe biggest peacetime defense build-up in historyâ against what, referencing Star Wars, he called an âevil empireââthe Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed âthe Vietnam Syndromeâ in part by rebranding that war a ânoble cause.â In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant, whose poor are a growth industry, whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East.		
Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his timeââLetâs reject the nonsense that America is doomed to declineââwas hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didnât hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthopâs âshining city upon a hillâ (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (âthe last best hope of man on Earthâ) invocations like âhere in the heartland of America lives the hope of the worldâ or âin a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankindâs best hope.â

And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didnât yet have to refer to us as the âgreatestâ country of all or as the planetâs sole truly âexceptionalâ country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective âindispensableâ as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didnât even arrive until Bill Clintonâs secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the countryâs eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent.		
As for the United States being the planetâs âexceptionalâ nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, itâs surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011,		
Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbaraâs exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase âAmerican exceptionalismâ except Obama. As U.S. Newsâ Robert Schlesinger wrote, âAmerican exceptionalismâ is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesingerâs search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term.

And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of âthe lady doth protest too much.â Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldnât be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness.		
This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did).		
Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is.		
Of course, donât furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms âloneâ on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully. Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger, however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) âthe Greatestâ or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional.		
So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donaldâor rather Donald!âTrump.

Donald Trump, in other words, is the first person to run openly and without apology on a platform of American decline. Think about that for a moment. âMake America Great Again!â is indeed an admission in the form of a boast. As he tells his audiences repeatedly, America, the formerly great, is today a punching bag for China, Mexicoâ¦ well, you know the pitch. You donât have to agree with him on the specifics. Whatâs interesting is the overall vision of a country lacking in its former greatness.		
Perhaps a little history of American greatness and presidents (as well as presidential candidates) is in order here.

âCity Upon a Hillâ
Once upon a time, in a distant America, the words âgreatest,â âexceptional,â and âindispensableâ werenât even part of the political vocabulary. American presidents didnât bother to claim any of them for this country, largely because American wealth and global preeminence were so indisputable. Weâre talking about the 1950s and early 1960s, the post-World War II and pre-Vietnam âgoldenâ years of American power. Despite a certain hysteria about the supposed dangers of domestic communists, few Americans then doubted the singularly unchallengeable power and greatness of the country. It was such a given, in fact, that it was simply too self-evident for presidents to cite, hail, or praise.		
So if you look, for instance, at the speeches of John F. Kennedy, you wonât find them littered with exceptionals, indispensables, or their equivalents. In a pre-inaugural speech he gave in January 1961 on the kind of government he planned to bring to Washington, for instance, he did cite the birth of a âgreat republic,â the United States, and quoted Puritan John Winthrop on the desirability of creating a country that would be âa city upon a hillâ to the rest of the world, with all of humanityâs eyes upon us. In his inaugural address (âAsk not what your country can do for youâ¦â), he invoked a kind of unspoken greatness, saying, âWe shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.â It was then common to speak of the United States with pride as a âfree nationâ (as opposed to the âenslavedâ ones of the communist bloc) rather than an exceptional one. His only use of âgreatâ was to invoke the US- and Soviet Unionâled blocs as âtwo great and powerful groups of nations.â		
Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, âwe must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscientâthat we are only six percent of the worldâs populationâthat we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankindâthat we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversityâand that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.â In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as âa great powerââbut not âthe greatest power.â

If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider Americaâs movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper, whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. Whatâs striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo.)		
Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, youâre heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it.		
The Reagan Reboot
That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word âagain.â It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled âProuder, Stronger, Better,â its first line ever so memorably went, âItâs morning again in America.â (âWhy would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?â)

Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over âthe biggest peacetime defense build-up in historyâ against what, referencing Star Wars, he called an âevil empireââthe Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed âthe Vietnam Syndromeâ in part by rebranding that war a ânoble cause.â In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant, whose poor are a growth industry, whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East.		
Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his timeââLetâs reject the nonsense that America is doomed to declineââwas hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didnât hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthopâs âshining city upon a hillâ (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (âthe last best hope of man on Earthâ) invocations like âhere in the heartland of America lives the hope of the worldâ or âin a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankindâs best hope.â

And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didnât yet have to refer to us as the âgreatestâ country of all or as the planetâs sole truly âexceptionalâ country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective âindispensableâ as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didnât even arrive until Bill Clintonâs secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the countryâs eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent.		
As for the United States being the planetâs âexceptionalâ nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, itâs surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011,		
Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbaraâs exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase âAmerican exceptionalismâ except Obama. As U.S. Newsâ Robert Schlesinger wrote, âAmerican exceptionalismâ is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesingerâs search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term.

And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of âthe lady doth protest too much.â Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldnât be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness.		
This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did).		
Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is.		
Of course, donât furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms âloneâ on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully. Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger, however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) âthe Greatestâ or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional.		
So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donaldâor rather Donald!âTrump.

Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over âthe biggest peacetime defense build-up in historyâ against what, referencing Star Wars, he called an âevil empireââthe Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed âthe Vietnam Syndromeâ in part by rebranding that war a ânoble cause.â In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant, whose poor are a growth industry, whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East.		
Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his timeââLetâs reject the nonsense that America is doomed to declineââwas hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didnât hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthopâs âshining city upon a hillâ (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (âthe last best hope of man on Earthâ) invocations like âhere in the heartland of America lives the hope of the worldâ or âin a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankindâs best hope.â

And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didnât yet have to refer to us as the âgreatestâ country of all or as the planetâs sole truly âexceptionalâ country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective âindispensableâ as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didnât even arrive until Bill Clintonâs secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the countryâs eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent.		
As for the United States being the planetâs âexceptionalâ nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, itâs surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011,		
Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbaraâs exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase âAmerican exceptionalismâ except Obama. As U.S. Newsâ Robert Schlesinger wrote, âAmerican exceptionalismâ is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesingerâs search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term.

And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of âthe lady doth protest too much.â Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldnât be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness.		
This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did).		
Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is.		
Of course, donât furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet.

Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully. Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger, however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) âthe Greatestâ or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional.		
So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donaldâor rather Donald!âTrump.

âCity Upon a Hillâ
Once upon a time, in a distant America, the words âgreatest,â âexceptional,â and âindispensableâ werenât even part of the political vocabulary. American presidents didnât bother to claim any of them for this country, largely because American wealth and global preeminence were so indisputable. Weâre talking about the 1950s and early 1960s, the post-World War II and pre-Vietnam âgoldenâ years of American power. Despite a certain hysteria about the supposed dangers of domestic communists, few Americans then doubted the singularly unchallengeable power and greatness of the country. It was such a given, in fact, that it was simply too self-evident for presidents to cite, hail, or praise.		
So if you look, for instance, at the speeches of John F. Kennedy, you wonât find them littered with exceptionals, indispensables, or their equivalents. In a pre-inaugural speech he gave in January 1961 on the kind of government he planned to bring to Washington, for instance, he did cite the birth of a âgreat republic,â the United States, and quoted Puritan John Winthrop on the desirability of creating a country that would be âa city upon a hillâ to the rest of the world, with all of humanityâs eyes upon us. In his inaugural address (âAsk not what your country can do for youâ¦â), he invoked a kind of unspoken greatness, saying, âWe shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.â It was then common to speak of the United States with pride as a âfree nationâ (as opposed to the âenslavedâ ones of the communist bloc) rather than an exceptional one. His only use of âgreatâ was to invoke the US- and Soviet Unionâled blocs as âtwo great and powerful groups of nations.â		
Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, âwe must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscientâthat we are only six percent of the worldâs populationâthat we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankindâthat we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversityâand that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.â In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as âa great powerââbut not âthe greatest power.â

If you didnât grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem. Quite the opposite, it implied a deep and abiding confidence in the overwhelming power and presence of this country, a confidence so unshakeable that there was no need to speak of it.

If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider Americaâs movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper, whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. Whatâs striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo.)		
Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, youâre heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it.		
The Reagan Reboot
That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word âagain.â It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled âProuder, Stronger, Better,â its first line ever so memorably went, âItâs morning again in America.â (âWhy would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?â)

Kennedy could even fall back on a certain modesty in describing the US role in the world (that, in those years, from Guatemala to Iran to Cuba, all too often did not carry over into actual policy), saying in one speech, âwe must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscientâthat we are only six percent of the worldâs populationâthat we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankindâthat we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversityâand that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.â In that same speech, he typically spoke of America as âa great powerââbut not âthe greatest power.â

If you didnât grow up in that era, you may not grasp that none of this in any way implied a lack of national self-esteem.

If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider Americaâs movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper, whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. Whatâs striking when you look back at them from the present moment is this: while neither of those actors was anything but an imposing figure, they were also remarkably ordinary looking. They were in no way over-muscled, nor were they over-armed in the modern fashion. It was only in the years after the Vietnam War, when the country had absorbed what felt like a grim defeat, been wracked by oppositional movements, riots, and assassinations, when a general sense of loss had swept over the polity, that the over-muscled hero, the exceptional killing machine, made the scene. (Think Rambo.)		
Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, youâre heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it.		
The Reagan Reboot
That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word âagain.â It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled âProuder, Stronger, Better,â its first line ever so memorably went, âItâs morning again in America.â (âWhy would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?â)

Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over âthe biggest peacetime defense build-up in historyâ against what, referencing Star Wars, he called an âevil empireââthe Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed âthe Vietnam Syndromeâ in part by rebranding that war a ânoble cause.â In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant, whose poor are a growth industry, whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East.		
Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his timeââLetâs reject the nonsense that America is doomed to declineââwas hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didnât hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthopâs âshining city upon a hillâ (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (âthe last best hope of man on Earthâ) invocations like âhere in the heartland of America lives the hope of the worldâ or âin a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankindâs best hope.â

And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didnât yet have to refer to us as the âgreatestâ country of all or as the planetâs sole truly âexceptionalâ country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective âindispensableâ as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didnât even arrive until Bill Clintonâs secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the countryâs eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent.		
As for the United States being the planetâs âexceptionalâ nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, itâs surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011,		
Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbaraâs exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase âAmerican exceptionalismâ except Obama. As U.S. Newsâ Robert Schlesinger wrote, âAmerican exceptionalismâ is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesingerâs search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term.

And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of âthe lady doth protest too much.â Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldnât be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness.		
This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did).		
Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is.		
Of course, donât furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms âloneâ on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully. Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger, however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) âthe Greatestâ or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional.		
So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donaldâor rather Donald!âTrump.

Think of this as part of a post-Vietnam Reagan reboot, a time when the United States in Rambo-esque fashion was quite literally muscling up and over-arming in a major way. Reagan presided over âthe biggest peacetime defense build-up in historyâ against what, referencing Star Wars, he called an âevil empireââthe Soviet Union. In those years, he also worked to rid the country of what was then termed âthe Vietnam Syndromeâ in part by rebranding that war a ânoble cause.â In a time when loss and decline were much on the American brain, he dismissed them both, even as he set the country on a path toward the present moment of 1 percent dysfunction in a country that no longer invests fully in its own infrastructure, whose wages are stagnant, whose poor are a growth industry, whose wealth now flows eternally upward in a political environment awash in the money of the ultra-wealthy, and whose over-armed military continues to pursue a path of endless failure in the Greater Middle East.		
Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his timeââLetâs reject the nonsense that America is doomed to declineââwas hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didnât hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthopâs âshining city upon a hillâ (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (âthe last best hope of man on Earthâ) invocations like âhere in the heartland of America lives the hope of the worldâ or âin a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankindâs best hope.â

And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didnât yet have to refer to us as the âgreatestâ country of all or as the planetâs sole truly âexceptionalâ country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective âindispensableâ as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didnât even arrive until Bill Clintonâs secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the countryâs eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent.		
As for the United States being the planetâs âexceptionalâ nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, itâs surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011,		
Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbaraâs exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase âAmerican exceptionalismâ except Obama. As U.S. Newsâ Robert Schlesinger wrote, âAmerican exceptionalismâ is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesingerâs search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term.

And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of âthe lady doth protest too much.â Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldnât be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness.		
This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did).		
Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is.		
Of course, donât furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms âloneâ on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully. Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger, however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) âthe Greatestâ or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional.		
So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donaldâor rather Donald!âTrump.		
		

Consider this, then, if you want a definition of decline: When you have to state openly (and repeatedly) what previously had been too obvious to say, youâre heading, as the opinion polls always like to phrase it, in the wrong direction; in other words, once you have to say it, especially in an overemphatic way, you no longer have it.		
The Reagan Reboot
That note of defensiveness first crept into the American political lexicon with the unlikeliest of politicians: Ronald Reagan, the man who seemed like the least defensive, most genial guy on the planet. On this subject at least, think of him as Trumpian before the advent of The Donald, or at least as the man who (thanks to his ad writers) invented the political use of the word âagain.â It was, after all, employed in 1984 in the seminal ad of his political run for a second term in office. While that bucolic-looking TV commercial was entitled âProuder, Stronger, Better,â its first line ever so memorably went, âItâs morning again in America.â (âWhy would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?â)

And yet in recent years it has become a commonplace of Republicans and Democrats alike. In other words, as the country has become politically shakier, the rhetoric about its greatness has only escalated in an American version of âthe lady doth protest too much.â Such descriptors have become the political equivalent of litmus tests: You couldnât be president or much of anything else without eternally testifying to your unwavering belief in American greatness.		
This, of course, is the line that Trump crossed in a curiously unnoticed fashion in this election campaign. He did so by initially upping the rhetorical ante, adding that exclamation point (which even Reagan avoided). Yet in the process of being more patriotically correct than thou, he somehow also waded straight into American decline so bluntly that his own audience could hardly miss it (even if his critics did).		
Think of it as an irony, if you wish, but the ultimate American narcissist, in promoting his own rise, has also openly promoted a version of decline and fall to striking numbers of Americans. For his followers, a major political figure has quit with the defensive BS and started saying it the way it is.		
Of course, donât furl the flag or shut down those offshore accounts or start writing the complete history of American decline quite yet. After all, the United States still looms âloneâ on an ever more chaotic planet. Its wealth remains stunning, its economic clout something to behold, its tycoons the envy of the Earth, and its military beyond compare when it comes to how much and how destructively, even if not how successfully. Still, make no mistake about it, Donald Trump is a harbinger, however bizarre, of a new American century in which this country will indeed no longer be (with a bow to Muhammad Ali) âthe Greatestâ or, for all but a shrinking crew, exceptional.		
So mark your calendars: 2016 is the official year the United States first went public as a declinist power and for that you can thank Donaldâor rather Donald!âTrump.		
		

Reagan, who spoke directly about American declinist thinking in his timeââLetâs reject the nonsense that America is doomed to declineââwas hardly shy about his superlatives when it came to this country. He didnât hesitate to re-channel classic American rhetoric ranging from Winthopâs âshining city upon a hillâ (perhaps cribbed from Kennedy) in his farewell address to Lincolnesque (âthe last best hope of man on Earthâ) invocations like âhere in the heartland of America lives the hope of the worldâ or âin a world wracked by hatred, economic crisis, and political tension, America remains mankindâs best hope.â

And yet, in the 1980s, there were still limits to what needed to be said about America. Surveying the planet, you didnât yet have to refer to us as the âgreatestâ country of all or as the planetâs sole truly âexceptionalâ country. Think of such repeated superlatives of our own moment as defensive markers on the declinist slope. The now commonplace adjective âindispensableâ as a stand-in for American greatness globally, for instance, didnât even arrive until Bill Clintonâs secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began using it in 1996. It only became an indispensable part of the rhetorical arsenal of American politicians, from President Obama on down, a decade-plus into the 21st century when the countryâs eerie dispensability (unless you were a junkie for failed states and regional chaos) became ever more apparent.		
As for the United States being the planetâs âexceptionalâ nation, a phrase that now seems indelibly in the American grain and that no president or presidential candidate has avoided, itâs surprising how late that entered the presidential lexicon. As John Gans Jr. wrote in The Atlantic in 2011,		
Obama has talked more about American exceptionalism than Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush combined: a search on UC Santa Barbaraâs exhaustive presidential records library finds that no president from 1981 to today uttered the phrase âAmerican exceptionalismâ except Obama. As U.S. Newsâ Robert Schlesinger wrote, âAmerican exceptionalismâ is not a traditional part of presidential vocabulary. According to Schlesingerâs search of public records, Obama is the only president in 82 years to use the term.

The first thing that struck me is how this is almost a model of a dysfunctional family (in this case the U.S.) who has a real bloodsucker of a member getting up and telling it how rotten it is.  It&apos;s like it&apos;s always in that script; a character who has been complicit in the problem now telling everyone how it&apos;s going to be if they just give him everything, not a little, of what he wants.   What Americans should have wanted with Trump back in 85 when he began showboating was a quick upside turn in the dumpster out back.  Close it up, seal it, forget about it.

Excellent argument.  Can&apos;y argue with any of it except for"ï»¿ If you want a pop cultural equivalent for this, consider Americaâs movie heroes of that time, actors like John Wayne and Gary Cooper, whose Westerns and, in the case of Wayne, war movies, were iconic. "  To those of us of a certain age, there is no more "iconic" war movie than Cooper&apos;s Sergeant York",  Wayne be damned.

The hubris of economic success in the 1950s and 1960s was because all the industrial countries of the world had lost their factories, infrastructure, buildings, and supply lines to bombing in the second World War.   We were the only people manufacturing, while the other industrial countries were rebuilding.  The foreign exchange was extremely favorable and the proud, obnoxious "ugly American" tourists were treated like royalty in these suffering countries, adding to that exceptional air of confidence.

"America" (the United States of) is portray as exceptionally the best, or the worst ever.  Both are true and false, but both extremes stink as a political device.  It is the worst and best of times.  Revolution is in the air, so is the "Tokyo Rose" psycho-babel from the Establishment Party and establishment media for Sanders to "surrender."
