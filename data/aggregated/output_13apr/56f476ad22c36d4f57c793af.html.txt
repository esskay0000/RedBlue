Aracely Calderon, a naturalized citizen from Guatemala, arrived just before the polls closed at 7 pm in downtown Phoenix to vote in Arizonaâs primary last night. âWhen Calderon arrived, the line spanned more than 700 people and almost 4 blocks,â the Arizona Republic reported. She waited in line for five hours, becoming the last voter in the state to cast a ballot at 12:12 am. âI’m here to exercise my right to vote,â she said shortly before midnight, explaining why she stayed in line.

But many other Arizonans left the polls in disgust. The lines were so long because election officials in Phoenixâs Maricopa County, the largest in the state, reduced the number of polling places by 70 percent from 2012 to 2016, from 200 to just 60âone polling place per every 21,000 voters.

Election officials said they reduced the number of polling sites to save moneyâan ill-conceived decision that severely inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of voters. Previously, Maricopa County would have needed to receive federal approval for reducing the number of polling sites, because Arizona was one of 16 states where jurisdictions with a long history of discrimination had to submit their voting changes under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. This type of change would very likely have been blocked since minorities make up 40 percent of Maricopa Countyâs population and reducing the number of polling places would have left minority voters worse off. Section 5 blocked 22 voting changes from taking effect in Arizona since the state was covered under the VRA in 1975 for discriminating against Hispanic and Native American voters.		
But after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA in 2013, Arizona could make election changes without federal oversight. The long lines in Maricopa County last night were the latest example of the disastrous consequences of that decision.		
âWe are outraged at long lines for Arizona primary,â The Arizona Republic wrote in a sharply worded editorial. The paper told stories of voters who left without casting a ballot because of the long lines.		
Here’s what one Maricopa County voter wrote to us:		
âI literally went to multiple polling places, a total of FIVE separate times, only to find that the 1 hour wait (which I didn’t have time for this morning) only increased as the day went on. Eventually, I gave up at 6:40 p.m. when I saw the line at its longest, at least 2-3 hours. This was the first time in my life I genuinely felt disenfranchised.”		
“Disenfranchised” was a flash word on Tuesday. Many voters used it.		
This impacted voters across the county, but some more than others. There wereÂ predominantly Latino areas in Maricopa County withÂ no polling places. “It is no coincidence many poor and predominantly Latino areas didnât get a polling place,” wrote Arizona Republic columnist Elvia Diaz.		
The 2016 election is the first in 50 years without the full protections of the VRA. Widespread voting problems during the primaries in states like Arizona and North Carolina are a disturbing preview of what could happen in November.

If the people on the far right want to make this country "great again" they need to re-instate the polling places so that as in past years, people could actually vote. This is still America, right? I read that your sheriff came out in support of Trump; afraid this says it all...

I realize there are bigger concerns at stake, but I find it very disturbing that the first instinct of so many is to assume Hillary has done something "criminal."  I have seen accusations all over social media today and tonight that somehow her campaign orchestrated this mess in Arizona, particularly from Sanders&apos; supporters.  If the areas most affected were primarily minority, wouldn&apos;t that have a hurt Hillary more if they could not vote?  Are people not aware of the significantly reduced number of polling places, which is obviously not under her control?  Can they not see that she would also have been affected by lost Democratic votes, but especially in minority communities?  WTH?   What is with this automatic assumption that Hillary could actually mastermind some kind of election fraud, and in Arizona, of all places?

Thanks for another good story, but how about a more comprehensive piece on what a sham the primary elections have become? The Des Moines Register has reported that the DNC falsified election results in Hillary&apos;s favor (http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/02/06/iowans-claim-instances-when-sanders-shorted-delegates/79902080/). Similar reports of fraud in Nevada (http://www.inquisitr.com/2819449/does-this-video-reveal-vote-fraud-in-the-nevada-caucus/) That was followed by Hillary&apos;s campaign (and Bill) violating Massachusetts election laws, not to mention more fraud (https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/ma-primary-unadjusted-exit-poll-indicates-bernie-won/). It seems the DNC has been rigging the primary just enough to keep Hillary out ahead, yet no one is reporting on the actual primary process & how little accountability there is. The differences between the 2 parties is so minimal & the elites that control parties know this, which is why they don&apos;t want outsiders (Trump & Sanders) to win & were got a bit off guard this time around, not expecting to have to manipulate things in the first go round (the primaries) too.

I really think AZ needs a revote! Is there a way to get this done?

The problem in AZ goes way beyond insufficient polling places.  Many, many newly registered democrats (read: independents and republicans who switched for this primary, and new voters) were unable to vote, even after waiting for hours. They were issued provisional ballots (until those ran out too), and told that their votes would not be counted. This one isn&apos;t about the GOP disenfranchising voters, it&apos;s about the DNC cheating for Hillary.

Exactly.  The chair of the NV Democratic Party urged voters to use provisional ballots if they found they weren&apos;t properly registered at the polls.  She promised they would be counted.  Let&apos;s see if that happens.

There were roughly 400,000 votes counted for Sanders and Clinton.  Just under 300,000 of those were early voting ballots.  With turnout estimates at about 600,000, that&apos;s a lot of provisional ballots cast.

Maricopa County, Arizona, is the most populous county. In 2008, the county had 400 polling places.  In 2012, they cut it in half to 200 places.  This year, yesterday, they had only 60 polling places in the county.  That was one polling place for every 21,000 registered voters.  Why?  Republicans win when the turnout is low. The AZ governor is Republican. The legislature is Republican dominated.  That&apos;s what you get when you have ugly partisans in control of the most vital right we have for a civil society.

They are rigging to remove Bernie. CLINTON has no opponent by rigging. Guaranteed!

I just posted a comment about this kind of thinking.  How did this help Hillary?  Did you read the article?  Minorities were more affected, and we all know Hillary wins more votes with minorities.  Why would she disenfranchise her own voters, hmm?    And how would she have managed this, anyway?  And why would she go to so much trouble for Arizona&apos;s delegates?  Save your paranoia.

No, we all don&apos;t know that Hillary does better with "minorities".  That&apos;s a lie.  Sanders did very well with hispanic voters in Nevada.

The whole corrupt system is totally ineffective.  The whole primary system is broken. There should be a national primary voting weekend with a general election to follow in 30 days. This primary contest would be publicly funded and overseen by the Department of Justice. Stringing the primaries out and allowing the media to create candidate interest as they desire ala Donald Trump is just another may for them to make more money and position their favorite candidate.

Your idea is sound, except for one big issue that will prevent it from becoming a reality: it&apos;s not profitable. We should absolutely streamline our election process, but then we wouldn&apos;t have revenue streams going first to local markets, then to national ones (or simultaneously in the case of the 24-news cycle). There are billions of dollars to be made, and we&apos;re going to do whatever we can to increase that amount. Democracy, as it turns out, is incredibly profitable.

Corporate Media wants 24/7/365 elections for the profits. If only our media was actually &apos;Liberal&apos;.

I always have to laugh whenI see comments about &apos;the liberal media&apos;.

As this experience in Arizona proves, the Republican plutocrats on the U.S. Supreme Court achieved in Shelby County v Holder want they intended -  the continuing deterioration of elections and other democratic processes in America.

American democracy will remain in mortal jeopardy unless liberal justices devoted to constitutional democracy are a majority of the Supreme Court.

A prime example of how Republicans hate not only America but Americans.  Nice job, Ari.

Too bad we can&apos;t institute an Emergency Voters Act to change the entire corrupt process. States don&apos;t have the right to disenfranchise American citizens with the right to vote. Voting laws should be uniform across America. Mail-in ballots accepted beginning four weeks before the election. All 18 year old  kids graduating from high school this year will be automatically enrolled to vote in their state. The election takes place over a three day weekend. The Friday before the voting weekend will be known as Voter&apos;s Rights Day and will be a mandatory paid holiday off. Elections will be monitored.  If we&apos;re paying TSA peoplewho wants our shoes off, there&apos;s plenty of money and manpower to monitor voting equally as closely.  Any state  where voters have to wait more than two hours, will have to stay open and accept voters for an extra two hours. A federal ballot in electronic form  will be uniform across the states. Tamper-evident programming can be built in. Just some ideas of how to retain our voting rights.

Awesome thoughts, ideas. Do propose them to the State or Fed gov administrative offices.

Hear, hear! Yes, make all elections the same across the board. Federally regulated and financed. No privatization of resources.

Having lived in Arizona for several years I can attest to the fact that this is just the tip of the iceberg for Republican dirty tricks aimed at voter suppression.  By continued gerrymandering and dirty tricks fomented by the evil likes of Karl Rove and ALEC, they continue to take any measure possible to continue the established corporate backed Neocon rule.  If the antics employed by the Republicans in Arizona to maintain illegitimate control were from another country we&apos;d be up in arms about treatment of  their people.    Here we just fume at a decision issued by a traitorous "Supreme" Court which continues to make unconstitutional decisions to back their corporate sponsors.    Now the corporate senate is refusing to perform their Constitutional duties in fear that they might lose their control.  I can only hope that the Arizona voters see what is happening around them and change their voting (note HRC is NOT a change) and elects independent representation.  Just saying...there is finally an opportunity at hand for a real "political revolution."  :  )

If Hillary wants to earn people&apos;s trust she should join Bernie in asking for an investigation. She won&apos;t, though, because she won.

She did not bother in OH...

Ari, as I understand it, Arizona allows early voting by mail? (In Washington State, we can vote by mail. I think it&apos;s the same in AZ.) If so, why were so many Arizonan&apos;s in line when they could have voted from the convenience of their homes? Just wondering. Are people afraid that mailed-in ballots are at greater risk of tampering?

Yes, I think many people worry that their mail-in ballot will not be counted. And of course there are incidents when boxes of uncounted ballots are discovered in trash bins?

Plus, absentee ballots are counted differently. Only if the race is close? Is this not true?

I can only speak for NY where it is public knowledge that absentee ballots by mail are counted *only* when there is a likelihood that they may alter the outcome of the election. If the election officials determine that there aren&apos;t enough votes cast by mail ... they remain sealed and uncounted.

That makes no sense. Why in heaven&apos;s name would anybody cast an absentee ballot, then? And leaving it up to the election rats watching the cheese reeks of partisanship; what are the criteria for some mandarin official(s) to make that call? When would it/they occur? Where is the failsafe mechanism to prevent manipulation? Which mandarin(s) are allowed to make that call, and when?
I must be missing something. Please enlighten me.

This underscores the critical importance of having a Democrat in the White House to nominate the next Supreme Court justices, so that such disenfranchisement will not be enshrined in the law.

Don&apos;t we have a Democrat in the White House now?  Have we abandoned the possibility that Obama may yet nominate a moderate judge to fill the ninth seat?  

I don&apos;t think Obama can do this alone without the public&apos;s support.  Every Republican senator who obstructs Obama&apos;s efforts to give our country a full compliment of justices should be noted by the voting public, and treated as hostile to our democracy henceforth.  Be sure to vote for and donate to their opponents until he/she sweetens their tune.  Drop them a little note and let them know of your displeasure and what your doing about it.

President Obama&apos;s spoke recently about voter rights, although it fell on deaf ears. The deceptive flag of voter disenfranchisement is out. And, in this election cycle with so many states having issues, i.e. AZ., UT., N.C. etc., the matter must be addressed in every state.

Who can we get to monitor OUR elections?

Jimmy Carter!
