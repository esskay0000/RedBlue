Hillary Clinton won the big, blue state of New York much the way she won the small, red state of South Carolina: by running a locally tailored campaign that nonetheless treated the state as a stageÂ for the issues and constituencies that will matter throughout the primaries, and into November. If South Carolina marked the end of the beginning of the Democratic primary race, as Clintonâs 86-14 win with black voters showed the trouble Sanders would have with that crucial if internally diverse voting bloc, New York marked the beginning of the end, and for some of the same reasons.

Clinton ran as a New Yorker, surrounding herself with local elected officials, harkening back to the (first) Clinton administration (which was staffed by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, both of whom introduced her at her Sheraton victory party), boring into issues of guns and housing and mass transit, and reminding voters at every stop that she fought for the Zadroga Act, which brought funding for 9/11 rescue workers made ill by their jobs there. âYou need a president who knows where Co-op City is!â she told the mostly black and Latino crowd at that enormous housing development in the Bronx last week. Co-op City also happens to be the largest polling place in the country;Â Clinton won it 3-to-1.		
Sanders had pulled an estimated 18,000 to an outdoor festival in the South Bronx in early April; Clinton filled the local community center with about 1,000. But as Dewayne Phillips told me there, that night: Â âSupporters of Bernie love rallies. Supporters of Hillary love to vote.â Indeed, the Bronx went 70-30 for Clinton. (Full disclosure: My daughter was the campaignâs Bronx organizer).		
Once again, Clinton won a huge majority of African Americansânot quite at South Carolina levels, but a resounding 75-25. She won 63 percent of womenâand 79 percent of black women. She won 63 percent of Latinos. The only demographic group SandersÂ carried was white men, along with young voters (so far, I canât find demographic data for young voters of color.)		
I saw the size and shape of Clintonâs victory not only at her rally in Co-op City but also at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn earlier this month, at an intimate event (by Sanders campaign standards) attended mostly by black and Latina women. The progressive Public Advocate Tish James hailed Clintonâs fight against guns, while first lady Chirlane McCray talked of her work going back to the Childrenâs Defense Fund. But the stars of the event were two local women: Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by the New York Police DepartmentÂ for selling loose cigarettes; and Nicole Bell, the fiancÃ©e of Sean Bell, killed by the NYPDÂ on the morning of their wedding. The support of women like Carr and Bell buoyed Clinton, which I saw in South Carolina, too, where she was first joined by the so-called âMothers of the Movement.â Carr joked that Clinton âcaught daggers in her teeth and threw them backâ at the Benghazi committee hearing last October; Carr and the other mothers were just as fierce in their advocacy for Clinton, all around New York City.

Some Sanders supporters on social media have arguedÂ that Clintonâs appeals to these women amount to pandering, but Tish James took issue with that, sharply. âI disagree sheâs pandering. Obviously, sheâs a politician; I am too, we read numbers, data. Obviously, sheâs trying to capitalize on the support of black women. I get that. But sheâs addressing their issues, especially this issue of gun violence. Sheâs against the gun lobby, and thatâs personal for me. Iâve held my share of grieving mothers and grandmothers. She wants to end the tears. She wants to stop the bloodshed and stop the flow of guns.â		
The Sanders campaign will complain, with some justification, that it was hopelessly disadvantaged by New Yorkâs byzantine (and tough on voters) registration laws in this closed primary. As numerous supporters complained on social media, anyone who wasnât registered as a Democrat had to change their registration back in October, which is a ridiculously long period of time before an election. On the other hand: The campaign didnât invest much in making sure their supporters were correctly registered back then. As the Sanders revolution goes forward, taking on the patchwork of discouraging voter-registration laws across the country ought to be on the agenda.

Ultimately, though, Sanders was undone by the same demographic forces that have bedeviled him beyond heavily white states like Vermont, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin: his failure to make inroads with voters of color. Though heâs won high-profile black and Latino surrogatesâSpike Lee, Killer Mike, Rosario Dawson, and Danny Gloverâand showcased them in New York, it gave his campaign a flyover feel, like he hadnât done the tedious work of winning over local elected officials and the neighborhood activists who dominate a Democratic Party primary, especially in a city like this. And thatâs because he hadnât. Itâs a painful irony that a campaign thatâs powered by grassroots contributors and a true bottom-up fundraising juggernaut has not been able to cultivate those same grassroots at the local level. The white Sanders supporter wearing a Bernie wig outside my Harlem polling place got a lot of laughs Tuesday, but Clinton got a lot of votes, winning the precinct 60-40. Despite the heft and importance of Sandersâs economic ideas, too often his New York campaign favored spectacle over substance.		
All of which makes campaign manager Jeff Weaverâs comments after the primary loss that much more discouraging. He told MSNBCâs Steve Kornacki that the campaign would âabsolutelyâ fight to flip superdelegates at the July convention, even if Clinton continues to lead in both pledged delegates and the popular vote, because of polls showing Sanders slightly trailing Clinton in national polls. That would certainly make the July convention a spectacle, but itâs unlikely to help his candidate win.		
âThe superdelegates have never catapulted anyone in second place into the nomination,â Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon told me Tuesday night, noting that the top Sanders strategist, Tad Devine, was an architect of the system. In 2008 Devine argued in an op-ed that âthe appropriate role of the super delegates is to ratify the leader in pledged delegates,â Fallon observed, and he predicted thatâs what they will do in July. For his part, Devine has been less provocative than Weaver since the New York loss, telling reporters the campaign will look at its status after next weekâs five primary elections, all in states where Clinton is currently leading.		
Clinton should be proud of her New York results. But she should be chastened by exit polls showing that even in the state thatâs home to Wall Street, most Democrats share Sandersâ views on the finance industry: Two-thirds said Wall Street âhurts the economyâ; only a third said it âhelps.â If sheâs the nominee, as is looking almost certain now, she will lead a Democratic Party that has shifted sharply to the left, particularly on economic issues, since the last time she ran to be its nominee eight years ago. A victory in November will require mobilizing the Sanders supporters who have played a role in that long-overdue party shift.

Before âUnity,â Sanders Must Stay in the Fight

Some Sanders supporters on social media have arguedÂ that Clintonâs appeals to these women amount to pandering, but Tish James took issue with that, sharply. âI disagree sheâs pandering. Obviously, sheâs a politician; I am too, we read numbers, data. Obviously, sheâs trying to capitalize on the support of black women. I get that. But sheâs addressing their issues, especially this issue of gun violence. Sheâs against the gun lobby, and thatâs personal for me. Iâve held my share of grieving mothers and grandmothers. She wants to end the tears. She wants to stop the bloodshed and stop the flow of guns.â		
The Sanders campaign will complain, with some justification, that it was hopelessly disadvantaged by New Yorkâs byzantine (and tough on voters) registration laws in this closed primary. As numerous supporters complained on social media, anyone who wasnât registered as a Democrat had to change their registration back in October, which is a ridiculously long period of time before an election. On the other hand: The campaign didnât invest much in making sure their supporters were correctly registered back then. As the Sanders revolution goes forward, taking on the patchwork of discouraging voter-registration laws across the country ought to be on the agenda.

Ultimately, though, Sanders was undone by the same demographic forces that have bedeviled him beyond heavily white states like Vermont, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin: his failure to make inroads with voters of color. Though heâs won high-profile black and Latino surrogatesâSpike Lee, Killer Mike, Rosario Dawson, and Danny Gloverâand showcased them in New York, it gave his campaign a flyover feel, like he hadnât done the tedious work of winning over local elected officials and the neighborhood activists who dominate a Democratic Party primary, especially in a city like this. And thatâs because he hadnât. Itâs a painful irony that a campaign thatâs powered by grassroots contributors and a true bottom-up fundraising juggernaut has not been able to cultivate those same grassroots at the local level. The white Sanders supporter wearing a Bernie wig outside my Harlem polling place got a lot of laughs Tuesday, but Clinton got a lot of votes, winning the precinct 60-40.

All of which makes campaign manager Jeff Weaverâs comments after the primary loss that much more discouraging.

That would certainly make the July convention a spectacle, but itâs unlikely to help his candidate win.		
âThe superdelegates have never catapulted anyone in second place into the nomination,â Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon told me Tuesday night, noting that the top Sanders strategist, Tad Devine, was an architect of the system.

Hilary is a fraud.   Look at the article here on her dealings in Latin America.  I used to like her in the early 90&apos;s until I found out how evil she truly is and how she is leading women, blacks and other groups down a road that may not turn out that nice. No matter what she does now, she really actually is scum.

So Mrs. Walsh again this morning on the Sunday news shows you engaged in the "artful smear " taking Sanders comments about poor people not voting and turning it against him. His point was correct, if  poor and working class Americans voted in proportion to their population size at the same levels the wealthy do , we would have a political revolution. 

But lets take this a little further ,you correctly point out that Clinton is winning the poor vote. mostly minority, so why is that ?, Your claim to be a progressive so lets look at the Clinton Years . Dean Baker certainly one of the most progressive and fluent economists on the left points out what a disaster the Clinton years actually were on all American workers . His critique of the Clinton economy and the Bush economy is spot on . Disastrous trade policy has decimated Americas middle class the recovery of the late nineties a bubble in paper assets the recovery in the Bush years a bubble in Housing. The recessions in 2001 and 2009 a reflection of the fact that artificial assets and borrowing against those assets can not make up make up for declining  incomes . Of course as the owner of the Baltimore Orioles points out this has left the urban poor mostly minority destitute without hope . By the way I voted with a clothes pin on my nose for Bill and Obama twice. 

Michelle Alexander&apos;s critique in this magazine was spot on . The Clinton miracle for  Black employment was taking blacks off the unemployment line and putting them on the soup-line at prisons around the Nation. The increase in extreme poverty caused by welfare reform another disaster for Americas poor . The depiction of Black youth as predators a racist code word that ignored the economics of poverty . By the way . while Bernie voted for the bill, he was not calling black youth predators, he can be heard on the House floor stating we can not just build prisons we have to alleviate the economic conditions that cause crime.         
So please as a progressive explain to me the attraction of Black voters to the Clinton&apos;s .  As Martin Luther King stated it does no good to be able to sit at the Lunch counter and not be able to buy the Sandwich. 

Moving to another area George Bush did not cause the Great Recession the Financial Modernization Act and the Commodities Futures Deregulation Act did . Both republican policy pushed again by Bill Clinton .
The loss of wealth in the minority community far exceeding the loss of wealth for the rest of the Nation .Thanks again Bill 
But have no fear when Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is President rest assured Hillary will not beat either .you will be heard again on the Networks railing against the interests of big money in Politics .

I fear that truth about the Clintons&apos; records will continue to be decried by Hillary&apos;s surrogates as smears from the apocryphal "Bernie bros" and other tropes that are being pushed by HC&apos;s superpac "Correct the Record," which, ironically, should be called "Distort the Record." The truth always hurts Hillary, and helps Bernie, so all they have left are smears, lies and distortion. Unfortunately, the MSM supports the Clinton campaign, and rarely questions the falsehoods perpetrated by Clinton surrogates. Now I half expect that Joan Walsh will say she&apos;s been horrified by the anti-Hillary sexism and vitriol in the comments sections of "The Nation."

I think "the beginning of the end of the Democratic Party&apos;s long death" would be more apt.  The Party has outlived its mission and its relevance and has become a decadent and malignant spectre of what it once was.

That&apos;s been my thinking in the past months as well. I&apos;ve been a lifelong Democrat. My first job was working on a Democratic Congressional campaign way back in 1976. But as I&apos;ve watched this so-called Democratic Party primary this year, the words someone spoke to me rang ever more true: "What we are witnessing in the Democratic Party Primaries is the political debate we used to see in the General Election." (I&apos;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine who has played the role of Republican). Recently I&apos;ve started referring to the Democratic Party as the Dumacratic Party.

For our fellow Hillary Democrats, keeping in mind that if we do not learn from history we are cursed to repeat it: "In the wake of the Clinton scandals, independents warmed to Bush&apos;s promise to &apos;restore honor and dignity to the White House.&apos; According to Voter News Service, the personal quality that mattered most to voters was &apos;honesty.&apos; Voters who chose &apos;honesty&apos; preferred Bush over Gore by over a margin of five to one. Forty Four percent of Americans said the Clinton scandals were important to their vote. Of these, Bush reeled in three out of every four." We are already destined to repeat it all over again......POWER TO THE PEOPLE FREE BERNIE.

Clinton won New York because 27% of the state&apos;s population identifies as Independent.  She would have been trashed if it were an open ballot.

Hillary won because of one reason alone: low voter turnout. The October 9, 2015 deadline did exactly what it was intended to do: keep all but the DNC establishment & their supporters from voting.

The deadline did exactly what it&apos;s designed to do: prohibit someone who, by self-definition, is definitely not a Democrat from participating in the party&apos;s candidate selection. Since you spit in the face of the party 1458 days out of every presidential election cycle don&apos;t be surprised if you don&apos;t get an invitation to the party&apos;s main event.  By registering as an independent or not remaining registered by not voting, you got exactly what you signed up for - nothing.

It should be obvious to any thinking person that Hillary Clinton&apos;s sole ideology is the acquisition of wealth and power and the brokering of influence on a hitherto unknown scale.  Hillary Clinton is the apotheosis of Bill Clinton&apos;s Arkansas good ole boy cronyism. Not a natural liar like her husband, by virtue of sheer determination she has demonstrated beyond a doubt that a woman can be at least as Machiavellian as any man. Thanks to Mr. Obama&apos;s bait-and-switch presidency, Mrs. Clinton became Secretary of State, although it is unclear exactly what her qualifications were. Certainly not her support of the Iraq fiasco. Whatever the reason, Mrs. Clinton dressed herself up in the robes of American global power . . . and she liked it; she liked the deference, the logged miles, the regime change, the drones, and she liked the death. "We came, we saw, he died." No need to cue in the laugh track; Mrs. Clinton&apos;s laughter was all that was needed to show the world that she was willing to project American power throughout the world . . . even with a bayonet. And this is what New York voted for. Or, at least, this is what the Cuomo machine voted for.

I love African Americans, something I have struggled with all my life, being "white."  However, as a culture, African Americans seem to be especially vulnerable to, and blinded by, machine politics.  The first black mayors of Newark, NJ (my beloved birthplace and home for my first 41 years) had many black leaders in City Hall in the 1960s, who followed the same corrupt practices as the whites before them - those whites  turned corruption and machine politics into an art form.  The city was a cash cow.  It was not until they elected Corey Booker in 2006 that things started to change, so I hear (I left in 1990.)  With the Hillary-Obama roc- solid connection, constantly thrown at African Americans, for years, Bernie didn&apos;t stand much of a chance.  In the south, polls indicate 1/3 of blacks didn&apos;t even know who Bernie was.  Now, West coast African-Americans may be more sophisticated, and they&apos;ve had a chance to know him.  We&apos;ll see.

I wonder how your statistical breakdowns would have changed if the most active voters in the city, the Working Family Party and others, had been permitted to vote?
Another article in this same issue notes that New York had the second lowest voter turn-out of this primary cycle, second only to Louisiana.
Does that sound like New York to you?
You think the results accurately represented the opinions of the politically active in New York?
Credit her clever campaign techniques if you and your daughter want, but I think there is a different story between the carrot of controlling the distribution of Party campaign funds and the stick of the well documented Clinton enemies list, then excluding voters who aren&apos;t under that control, then claiming the victory is explained by a quality candidate with clever campaign strategies.
We see this strategy.  We are campaigning to make it illegal.
Progressive candidates will run down-ballot in New York, and there is not much you and the Cuomo patriarchy can do to stop them in the fall.  You&apos;ll have to deal with them in Washington and Albany, and they know the score.

The Clinton control of the party and the liberal media would make boss tweed jealous. But in fairness the NY voting law was designed to keep the machine pick in the lead at a time when independents did not represent a large share of voters . My own daughter was caught in the trap . 
I vote working parties but why would anyone register a disenfranchisement

The two party system parties complement each other and love the system more than the electorate.  All they need is a run-off election rule to allow other parties in.  The two biggest vote getters would runoff in a second election.  Bill Clinton probably would not have been president with such a system, because he won with only 44% of the vote.  Ross Perot, a fiscal conservative, got 8%, and probably took votes from Bush the father.  The two parties will never support runoffs.  They would rather see the opposition win, than have a truly democratic voting process.

There simply won&apos;t be enough Sanders supporters, young or old, to rally behind her to prevail in the general. If she faces Trump, she&apos;ll go even further to the right to attempt to gain moderate republicans, but that will be a tough battle.  She will surely lose if she faces anyone else.  Clinton supporters should start wising up to this fact, but they won&apos;t.

Republican-lite never worked for Democrats.  Conservatives would rather have the real thing.

Dear Joan, What Hillary must do for my vote in November is reverse he bellicosity and her scary coziness with the Neocon! What most puzzles me about Hillary supporters like yourself, is how you are able to overlook her neocon relationships (e.g., Vicoria Nuland and husband Robert Kagan - best buddies with Elliot Abrahams). These two former guys get you into the heart of the neocons. Based on Hillary&apos;s record on the Ukraine, Syria, Libya, Honduras and her belligerence toward Russia and Iran, I&apos;m concerned. I can understand Hillary supporters overlooking these important facts from their tendency to get their news from corporate media, but given where you are employed and who you are surrounded by, I&apos;d hope you&apos;d address this. Concern with "ambitious = misogyny" rather than "Hillary = Necon" is sad.

Yes, Hillary supporters&apos; concern for women stops at the border.   Also, Obama is a neocon/neolib as well.  A top advisor of his, Vickie Nuland, threw a fit when war with Russia was avoided.  His UN ambassador,   Samantha Powers, is a big advocate of destroying nations to "help" them (R2P).

Apparently Hillary&apos;s concern about the flow of guns doesnit extend to the arms deals she facilitated as Secretary of State, including a hefty one with the manufacturer if the Bushmaster.

"locally tailored campaign" - that&apos;s a problem with Hillary that her supporters miss, but Sanders&apos; supporters definitely don&apos;t.

Hillary has as many faces as she has people to meet.  She&apos;s an Avenue K politician, not a human being with values or principles that reflect any meaningful solidarity with humanity.  Lies and slanders are her first language.  The millions of humans she&apos;s helped kill never trouble her sleep at night.  In fact, she boasts and laughs about her kills.  She&apos;s a vampire.  A shape-shifting, narcissistic psychopath.  If the New Dem Party has put her forward, the best consequences for them is to find no support in November.  Rather, to wake up and find that a National Left-Labor-Climate Party has formed with numbers with numbers that dwarf this corporatist, warmongering arm of the Republicans called "democrat".

Wow you bernie bros are getting absolutely pathetic. Just attacking anyone who doesn&apos;t blindly fall in love with your gun loving savior. He got trounced yesterday. She won over a million votes. Unless black votes and lives simply don&apos;t matter to you bernie bros, you will start listening and showing some humility and asking why his message is simply not resonating with communities of color. First the excuse was that the south is too conservative now it&apos;s the rules of the state democratic party. What&apos;s the excuse for florida Ohio north carolina or virginia? I forgot massachusetts and new york were soared. Whine whine whine from bernie bros. It&apos;s getting worse than trump. Just stop with the excuses, the disdain for the will of the people and the rabid attacks on anyone who dares tell the truth about bernie sanders&apos;s shortcomings. It&apos;d starting to get boring and tiresome and hopefully the msm will stop trying to resuscitate berries dying campaign to keep viewer and reader interest. Let&apos;s unite behind the first woman president the same way Hillary supporters got behind Obama in 2008. 

She isn&apos;t the compromised corporate tool you delusional bernie bros caricature her as. She&apos;s fought hard to succeed in a world stacked against women and especially women of color who went 80 percent for hrc yesterday. So just stop it once and for all.

in response to this obvious attack from Hillary&apos;s superpac mastermind David Brock, here is the proof: from 4/21/16 "Correct the Record":
"BREAKERS 2016: A PROJECT OF CORRECT THE RECORD
25
TASK FORCE WILL HELP CLINTON SUPPORTERS PUSH BACK ON ONLINE HARASSMENT AND THANK
SUPERDELEGATES
"...Correct The Record will invest more than $1 million into Barrier Breakers 2016 activities, including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram. Barrier Breakers 2016 is a project of Correct The Record and the brainchild of David Brock, and the task force will be overseen by President of Correct The Record Brad Woodhouse and Digital Director Benjamin Fischbein. The task force staffâs backgrounds are as diverse as the community they will be engaging with and include former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers, Ready for Hillary alumni, and Hillary super fans who have led groups similar to those with which the task force will organize."

You Hillary supporters, including Walsh, never make an affirmative case for Clinton, but rather make vague claims about how much she&apos;s accomplished and how she&apos;s the only one who can get things done with congress.  Please give a list of specific things she achieved or policies she instituted or fought for, for the benefit of women and children.  As first lady, she supported Ted Kennedy&apos;s CHIP insurance program for children.  Other than that, I can&apos;t think of anything she&apos;s accomplished or supported, except things that were particularly harmful to women and children (bankruptcy bill; welfare reform; degregulation of Wall St.; the crime bill; Iraq; Libya; Syria).  And how exactly will she be able to get things done with Congress, unlike Sanders?  And will Clinton make Cabinet choices similar to those of Obama - Wall Streeters, industry insiders, and neocons - or will pick people who will work for 99%ers and even us lowly Bernie Bros?

The "gun-loving" falsification, and the Sandy Hook apology statement, was the final blow to drive us Bernie supporters away, once and for all - we used to call that "character assassination."  With the endless advantages she has had, did she really have to strike such a low blow?  I guess we can expect that from someone who turns a blind eye to all the war blood on her hands in Yemen, Honduras, Ukraine, Libya, etc.  Lady Macbeth was a female too.

This is the same kind of bullying, browbeating, scolding vitriol towards Sanders supporters that we noticed on the New York Times, and which finally led us to ending our subscription. "Our gun loving savior," meme, the "Bernie Bros" trope, the "black lives don&apos;t matter to Bernie Sanders" quote - these all originate with the Clinton campaign&apos;s Machiavellian mastermind, David Brock. If all you have are these tired attack lines and the fact that Hillary Clinton is a woman, then you haven&apos;t made any case for her candidacy.

Are you aware that Mr. Obama dubbed Mrs. Clinton Annie Oakley in 2008 because of her shameless pandering to the guns and bibles crowd after Obama had made an indelicate comment about same? The New York Times actually commemorated Mrs. Clinton&apos;s behavior with the following headline: "Clinton Portrays Herself as  a Pro-Gun Churchgoer". And pursuing the liability of gun sellers, consider this, perhaps the victims and families of victims killed or maimed by American weaponry used abroad should sue the United States in general and Mrs. Clinton in particular because of her role in approving weapons sales to belligerent nations and groups. The fact that State Department approval apparently was contingent upon contributions to The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation just might be relevant, too. By the way, just in case you wanted to accuse me of sexism simply because I find Mrs. Clinton to be unqualified on moral grounds to become President, you should know that I contributed money a year ago to urge Senator Warren to run for President. Also, please know that I fully intend to vote for Dr. Jill Stein (a woman) in the general election if the Democratic Party is fatuous enough to nominate Mrs. Clinton for President. The problem is not that Mrs. Clinton is a woman. The problem is that she has no morals. In fact, Mrs. Clinton is a DoppelgÃ¤nger for her friend, Dr. Kissinger, who is a man. I find both Dr. Kissinger and Mrs.Clinton unfit to be President of the United States because of their general moral turpitude, not because of their respective genitalia or any other reasons. So if you want to accuse me of "Bernibro" sexism, I&apos;ll just have to quote you, "So just stop it once and for all". I do hope that I have made my position clear to you.

Why isn&apos;t the media talking about Chelsea&apos;s new apartment in Manhattan with the 283-ft hallway? It&apos;s a product of hedge fund money, which is relevant as hell.  And Chelsea is a public figure through her campaign appearances and paid TV contract.

Even more relevant, is how the Clintons went from being "dead broke" (Hillary&apos;s own words) when leaving the White House, to amassing a small fortune that includes 4 estates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5hn5B8TYI

The Clintons became members of the 1% after Bill lost his job....and no one is reporting on how this came to be.

filthy rich is the term most used

Wow!  You know, I get the gender issue, and I can appreciate that there are lots of older women (I say older only to establish a contextual history) who want to see the glass ceiling finally broken.  It&apos;s totally valid.  However... Consider the foreign policy history of HRC.  The mutual admiration between Ms Clinton and Madeline Allbright, and Henry Kissinger is not out of context.  Allbright felt the death of 1/2 million Iraqi children under 5 was "worth it".  There must be a special place in Hell for that kind of a perspective.  And Henry the K, he has a well documented history as a war criminal that will be protected until his death.  Forget about Benghazi, and think about Libya, and Syria, and Iraq.  But somehow raising these issues makes us "rabid" or "Bernie bros".   I think that qualifies as demonization.

Foreign policy (bloated, never held accountable Pentagon) is strangling our domestic policy.  Women should see that.  I guess if you&apos;ve adopted the neoliberal outlook, that&apos;s OK, you want to privatize everything anyway.

Joan, wouldn&apos;t you feel more at home writing for RedState.com?

Get a grip Bern bro. Drop this rabid with us or against us nonsense. Joan Walsh is not a conservative.

Now that I comprehend that you are being paid by Correct the Record, Hillary&apos;s superpac, masterminded by David Brock, I see that there is no further point in responding to your provocative comments.

You, Ms Hannay, are the one using alienating language and disparaging names. If you could take off your genderizing spectacles for a moment or two, you might just see that there are some valid points here. At the same time, ask yourself if Mrs. Clinton&apos;s agenda and public decisons are congruent with the the agenda of FDR. Because it is the New Deal which is the "gold standard" for us who support Mr. Sanders, obviously not in all details, but in spirit and in intention. We belive that Clintonian triangulation is nothing more than a flanking movement to the political right, a usurpation of the conservative outlook as a means to obtaining political power and the capital by which Wall Street traditionally funded the Republicans. If cozying up to Wall Street is not anathema to you, you have an entirely different understanding of just what the Democratic Party&apos;s function in the world is.

"you have an entirely different understanding of just what the Democratic Party&apos;s function in the world is." or once was.

Somehow we all knew what you would say, Ms Walsh, and that you would not at all mention voter disenfranchisement. Thanks for your courage.

There were at least 126000 voters purged in Brooklyn (way more than the difference between Sanders and HRC in BK) and polling places in Queens and Brooklyn had long lines and broken machines and some didn&apos;t even open on time. In upstate, places where Sanders got 60% or more, the polls that used to open at 6am this year (for some reason) opened at noon. Clinton does well with voters. And the civic duty in the African American communities is something she and Bill capitalized on for years. Of course the housing projects in the Bronx knew her name and not Sanders. It is not that his message doesn&apos;t resonate, it is that they have a relationship with her since she has been campaigning for their vote for years and years. It is amazing he did as well as he did there. She also did better with people who make less than $30,000 and do not have higher degrees. This is not because they don&apos;t understand income inequality, but because they live in information deserts and often in an educational and digital divides - she has a lot more name recognition than Sanders.  And what jumps out in the data from the Bronx is that it is because of such segregation that it has been so possible to target those communities, who also vote regularly and have their polling places run properly. Yet, Sanders does well with people who don&apos;t usually vote (like Obama) and in the case of NY, their votes were structurally suppressed in a system set up for regular voters and ill-equipped for the rest. In a general, NY will go blue and South Carolina red, but they are getting all the focus to show that Sanders is not viable. But Sanders got enough votes on his own in this primary (even without the HRC votes that would go to him in a general) to beat any Republican in NY. WI on the other hand is a swing state - one where (thanks to Sanders and same day voter registration/open primary/working polls) we just had the highest youth turnout since the 70s. If the media was interested in being intelligent instead of sensationalist, WI would have been the huge focus and not NY. If democrats want to win in a general, they will want all the votes they can get, particularly in swing states and not states that always go Red (South Carolina) or Blue (NY). And in the future, if we want democracy, we will need to have expanded civic duty/political efficacy/and systems of support (not suppression) for people to vote - even if they are young or have not in a few years. Bernie volunteers worked hard (and didn&apos;t just go to rallies), but they were fighting a particularly uphill battle with a system so set up against his base.

NYC is maintaining that reputation as a dirty rotten apple

"A victory in November will require mobilizing the Sanders supporters who have played a role in that long-overdue party shift." This will not likely be an achievable goal. Now that the establishment needs us, they will try to dupe us into believing that Hillary and Bernie are interchangeable. They are not - even remotely. The powers that be will try to inveigle us into falling in line; this, after almost a year of sidelining, lying about, and at times even ridiculing our candidate and his supporters. Starting with the "sexism" claim, the "Bernie Bros" meme, the "Bernie is a gun loving socialist" trope, "the Bernie and his lack of appeal to minorities problem," and all of the other false attacks they have launched and perpetrated, we are supposed to sweep these under the proverbial run and march to their orders for fear of the rise of Donald Trump. Well, he&apos;s scary, but even scarier is the level of deceit and propaganda that have been disseminated by the 1%. Our voices have been powerful through the internet and social media yet not powerful enough to squelch the 24/7 anti-Bernie babble of the MSM and DNC. It&apos;s a sorry state of affairs, and no way is Hillary Clinton the one to fix this broken system.

The historically low turnout in New York went unmentioned, not surprisingly. This awkward fact doesn&apos;t bode well for Secretary Clinton&apos;s chances, especially if she winds up running against anyone other than Trump, the only candidate whose unfavorability ratings are higher than her own.

Hillary has the unique ability to make Donald Trump look better than he is, to republicans and right leaning independents.  If Hillary loses, they will blame Bernie (and his supporters) for not being her lapdog.

Hillary actually has the ability to make Trump look like the lesser of  two evils even to some strongly left-leaning progressives.  He is buffoonish and unpredictable, but to the left of her on many issues (wars of choice for regime change, for example), and so if it turns out to be a contest between HerRoyalC and the DTs we will have an assortment of what used to be called "cluster B traits" to choose between: on the democratic side, sociopathy and narcissism; on the republican side an outrageous, Gorgeous-George style narcissism.  It will be a sort of pro-wrestling match between Gorgeous George and (I&apos;m not sure what she could call herself) a wily, technocratic career death- and incarceration-dealer in a sort of lab coat.  The Banality of Trump Tower versus the Banality of "We came, we saw, he died."  Trump Tower is truly in outrageously bad taste and laughable as architecture, and yet one can imagine nastier things "getting done" in a more restrained Chappaqua residence over the career criminal dining table.

NoraWD was the campaign&apos;s Bronx organizer? Wow. That&apos;s trÃ¨s impressionnant. Hillary isn&apos;t the only one who should be proud.

Sanders all the way to the convention.

So somehow Sanders was supposed to reach out to local 
political leaders .Would any have picked up the phone .
The Clinton hold on the Democratic party is so pervasive as to make Boss Tweed jealous. 
Those brave enough to stand up and support Sanders have and will face retribution,  
As for the minority vote that is so disproportionately Clinton as to be incredulous. There is only one explanation and will not go there . Sanders on every level has a strong civil rights record and has certainly been more vigorous in his civil rights as well as economic inequality agenda than Clinton . Sorry Mr Lewis you did not see Hillary in 64 she was a Goldwater Girl . Marian  Edelman would not have to be a Sanders critic . While Mrs Clinton referred to Supper Predators the Senator can be found on the house floor stating that we can not simply build prisons we must eliminate the poverty the joblessness the hopelessness at the root of the crime problem.

For sure. reaching out to local leaders for him has been paddling upstream. And any one of them that has backed Sanders in this political climate has shown incredible courage and deserves praise. http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/04/8596894/after-public-anguish-bronx-councilman-endorses-sanders-eve-primary

Unfortunately HRC&apos;s move to the left was only for show/primary votes and JW and too many media "educated" folks fell for it also. Fasten your seat belts for the abrupt catapult to the center for the election and again to the center-right if she gets elected.

Actually, I remember that when Obama&apos;s reelection prospects were in some trouble, Joan Walsh wrote a piece saying he needed to sound more like a progressive...Not be more progressive or govern more progressively, just sound like it.  The MSM is not fooled by these "shows", they help promote them in order to fool the rest of us and maintain their cushy status quo.

If Hillary is elected, I bet the U.S. will have significant military involvement in Syria within the year.

How facile and ridiculous of you to say he could have farmed the local politicians to support him when in fact they had already been harnessed, or more specifically, bribed and intimidated by the vulgar clintonian democratic machine.  She will never get substantial support from  the Sanders voters.  Our campaign will continue well into the Fall to make certain she, as the antithesis of all that Bernie represents, will never dirty the White House again.

Well, Ms. Walsh, I complemented you for your previous piece, mistaking you for an honest broker. Now, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll have to file you under Establishment Mouthpiece. Why not extend your approval to the Katherine Harris-certified 2000 Florida result, while you&apos;re at it? (Every time a "liberal" cheers/shrugs at a stolen election, Karl Rove smiles. Good job, Joan. Your sell-out is complete.)

Blacks voted Republican for years they will change their minds with the right information which has been blocked by MSM and M$NBC drone Joan Walsh

How do you spell sycophant?   Ask H. to release the Verizon speech let alone the Goldman Sachs speeches.
