WASHINGTON â A conservative political action committeeÂ funded in part by the Koch brothersÂ is spending more than $1 million to air television ads attacking Nevada Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto.

Freedom Partners Action Fund, based in Arlington, Va., announced the two ads on Tuesday. One says that when Cortez Masto was attorney general, sheÂ hired a Washington law firm to help residents deal with the housing crisis, then reaped thousands in campaign donations from the firmâs attorneys.

The second ad criticizes her travel while in office. Both ads label her a âspecial interest politician.â

Cortez Masto's campaignÂ immediately fired back.

âWashington Republicans are lying about Catherine Cortez Mastoâs record because they know as Nevadaâs next senator, she will focus on solving problems for Nevada families, not pushing their extreme agenda,â said campaign spokesman Zach Hudson.

AsÂ attorney general, Cortez Masto âheld Big Banks accountable and helped deliver $1.9 billion in relief to Nevadans,â Hudson said in a statement. Cortez Masto'sÂ travel was in the course of participating in groups of attorneys general around the country.

Hudson went on to criticize Republican candidate Rep. Joe Heck, noting that Heck had called the mortgage crisis a âblip on the radar.â

The two are vying for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, who is retiring.

Freedom Partners Action Fund is a super PAC that can accept and spendÂ unlimited amounts of money but is barred from coordinatingÂ with candidates'Â campaigns.

Also this week, the fund reported spending $2 million on ads supporting Republican Sen. Ron Johnsonâs re-election bid. He is opposed by Democrat Russ Feingold.

The PAC was created in 2014 to focusÂ on supporting candidates who favor âa free market and a free society.â

Charles Koch has given $8 million to the PAC, including $3 million in December 2015. His brother David Koch has given $2 million.
