Tijuana, Mexico (CNN)In a strip mall on a dusty street, a group of U.S. military veterans gather. Like any group of old soldiers, they joke, swap stories and keep each others' spirits up. But they aren't in Texas or California. This isn't a local VFW. This is Tijuana, Mexico a place most of these men barely knew before being banished here. 

"That's our angel. Right there. El comandante."
