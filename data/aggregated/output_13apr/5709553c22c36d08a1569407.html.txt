The day after President Obama ended his historic trip to Havana, Cubans turned on their TV sets and watched his surprise guest appearance in a skit on the popular weekly show Vivir del Cuento (Live by Your Wits). The showâs star, PÃ¡nfiloâa character created by Cuban comedian Luis Silvaâis playing dominoes in his humble apartment against two friends, complaining that he needs a teammate. Lo and behold, the president of the United States walks in. âÂ¿QuÃ© bolÃ¡?â Obama says, Cuban slang for âWhatâs happening?â After chanting âObama,Â Obama, so nice you came to Havana,â PÃ¡nfilo asks the president how his visit is going.

âItâs been excellent!â Obama tells him. âThe people have been wonderful. The food has been excellent, [also] the music. The Cubans here have all treated my family so nicely. Iâm very grateful, and Iâm so excited to be able to make this trip.â		
âAn emotional moment!â PÃ¡nfilo agrees. âA time of mutual respect. We are so happy that [US-Cuba] relations are getting fixedâ¦. And not only relations, but the streets also,â he adds slyly, referring to the governmentâs efforts to spruce up Havana before the American presidentâs arrival.		
It was actually Obamaâs second appearance on Vivir del Cuento; heâd taped a mock phone call with PÃ¡nfilo from the Oval Office for an episode that aired just before his arrival in Havana. The presidentâs cameos were quietly arranged by the US embassy, with Obama having final say over the proposed script sent from Havana to the White House.		
Obamaâs humorous chitchat with PÃ¡nfilo advanced a key goal of his trip: direct engagement with the Cuban populace. His deft use of president-to-people diplomacy proved to be the most successful accomplishment of his three-day visit. âHe is a person who knows how to speak without offending,â one taxi driver commented. âUnlike all the previous presidents.â									
 
Obamaâs Agenda
Obama came to Cuba with an ambitious agenda. In addition to forging a direct and positive connection with the Cuban public, he wanted to establish a rapport with President RaÃºl Castro and mobilize economic, cultural, and political forces in the United States in support of his commitment to âwrite a new chapterâ in US-Cuba relations. The president intended his trip, notes American University professor William LeoGrande, to be âa bold stroke aimed at accelerating the process of normalization and making his policy of engagement irreversible.â		
The timing, itinerary, and presidential entourage were all designed to advance that goal. By going now, rather than waiting until heâs a lame duck after the November election, Obama will have more time to use the power of the presidency to deepen normalization. The presidentâs schedule included formal and informal bilateral meetings with RaÃºl Castro; forums with Cuban entrepreneurs and human-rights and democracy advocates; and opportunities to engage Cuban society at largeâthrough TV and radio, as well as by attending a baseball game with some 50,000 Cuban fans.		
Along with his wife and daughters, Obama was accompanied by a large bipartisan congressional delegation as well as CEOs and VIPs from major businesses like Google, PayPal, and Airbnb. His entourage also included politically influential Cuban-American businesspeople from Miami who have been converted from diehard backers of regime change to avid proponents of engagement. Most prominent among them was Carlos Gutierrez, who served as secretary of commerce during George W. Bushâs second term. Gutierrez predicted to reporters in Cuba that, in the wake of Obamaâs trip, US business interests would âbecome more activeâ in pushing the GOP-led Congress to lift the US embargo.

The Speech
In the months before Air Force One landed at JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport, White House negotiators, led by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, worked with their Cuban counterparts to script the summit. Their agreement included two opportunities for Obama to talk directly to a national audience via television and radio: a press conference at the Palacio de la RevoluciÃ³n following his private meeting with RaÃºl Castro on March 21, and a speech the next day at the venerable Gran Teatroâthe same venue where Calvin Coolidge, the only other US president to visit Cuba, had addressed the Cuban people in 1928.		
The press conference proved to be the most uncomfortable encounter of the trip. Unlike his rhetorically gifted older brother Fidel, RaÃºl seldom speaks in public; indeed, nobody in Cuba could recall a time when he had answered questions from the media. But after Obamaâs repeated requests, Castro agreed at the last minute to participate. According to their apparent agreement, after their opening statements, Obama would take two questions from US reporters, while Castro would respond to a single question from a Cuban reporter.		
But the White House put Castro in the spotlight by picking Jim Acosta, CNNâs aggressive Cuban-American White House correspondent, to ask the first question. Instead of one question to Obama, Acosta asked three, and he posed four to Castro as well, pressing him on human rights and political prisoners. The press conference will be remembered for Castroâs defensive declarationââPolitical prisoners? Show me a list and I will free themââas well as his failed attempt to raise Obamaâs hand in a joint salute when it ended. Pictures of that awkward moment provided âthe perfect depiction,â as Jon Lee Anderson described it in The New Yorker, âof two leaders who represent nations that were once fierce enemies and have yet to figure out how to become fast friends.â		
In his speech at the ornate and beautifully restored theater the next day, Obama preÂ­sented his âchange you can believe inâ arguments to both the Cuban people and government. Drafted by Rhodes, the presidentâs address was carefully constructed to acknowledge Cubansâ pride in their revolutionary accomplishments and their legitimate national-security concerns about the history of US aggression, while voicing the presidentâs own hopes for Cubaâs socioeconomic and political evolution and improved US-Cuba relations in a nonimperious tone.

âCuba has an extraordinary resource: a system of education which values every boy and every girl,â Obama noted at one point in his speech. In a compliment to Cubaâs international medical brigades, he said, âNo one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and sufferingâ around the world.		
Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.		
As Obama prepared his Cuban visit, reporters asked repeatedly whether he would meet with former president Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

âItâs been excellent!â Obama tells him. âThe people have been wonderful. The food has been excellent, [also] the music. The Cubans here have all treated my family so nicely. Iâm very grateful, and Iâm so excited to be able to make this trip.â		
âAn emotional moment!â PÃ¡nfilo agrees. âA time of mutual respect. We are so happy that [US-Cuba] relations are getting fixedâ¦. And not only relations, but the streets also,â he adds slyly, referring to the governmentâs efforts to spruce up Havana before the American presidentâs arrival.		
It was actually Obamaâs second appearance on Vivir del Cuento; heâd taped a mock phone call with PÃ¡nfilo from the Oval Office for an episode that aired just before his arrival in Havana. The presidentâs cameos were quietly arranged by the US embassy, with Obama having final say over the proposed script sent from Havana to the White House.

To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

âAn emotional moment!â PÃ¡nfilo agrees. âA time of mutual respect. We are so happy that [US-Cuba] relations are getting fixedâ¦. And not only relations, but the streets also,â he adds slyly, referring to the governmentâs efforts to spruce up Havana before the American presidentâs arrival.		
It was actually Obamaâs second appearance on Vivir del Cuento; heâd taped a mock phone call with PÃ¡nfilo from the Oval Office for an episode that aired just before his arrival in Havana. The presidentâs cameos were quietly arranged by the US embassy, with Obama having final say over the proposed script sent from Havana to the White House.		
Obamaâs humorous chitchat with PÃ¡nfilo advanced a key goal of his trip: direct engagement with the Cuban populace. His deft use of president-to-people diplomacy proved to be the most successful accomplishment of his three-day visit. âHe is a person who knows how to speak without offending,â one taxi driver commented. âUnlike all the previous presidents.â									
 
Obamaâs Agenda
Obama came to Cuba with an ambitious agenda. In addition to forging a direct and positive connection with the Cuban public, he wanted to establish a rapport with President RaÃºl Castro and mobilize economic, cultural, and political forces in the United States in support of his commitment to âwrite a new chapterâ in US-Cuba relations. The president intended his trip, notes American University professor William LeoGrande, to be âa bold stroke aimed at accelerating the process of normalization and making his policy of engagement irreversible.â		
The timing, itinerary, and presidential entourage were all designed to advance that goal. By going now, rather than waiting until heâs a lame duck after the November election, Obama will have more time to use the power of the presidency to deepen normalization. The presidentâs schedule included formal and informal bilateral meetings with RaÃºl Castro; forums with Cuban entrepreneurs and human-rights and democracy advocates; and opportunities to engage Cuban society at largeâthrough TV and radio, as well as by attending a baseball game with some 50,000 Cuban fans.		
Along with his wife and daughters, Obama was accompanied by a large bipartisan congressional delegation as well as CEOs and VIPs from major businesses like Google, PayPal, and Airbnb. His entourage also included politically influential Cuban-American businesspeople from Miami who have been converted from diehard backers of regime change to avid proponents of engagement. Most prominent among them was Carlos Gutierrez, who served as secretary of commerce during George W. Bushâs second term. Gutierrez predicted to reporters in Cuba that, in the wake of Obamaâs trip, US business interests would âbecome more activeâ in pushing the GOP-led Congress to lift the US embargo.

The Speech
In the months before Air Force One landed at JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport, White House negotiators, led by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, worked with their Cuban counterparts to script the summit. Their agreement included two opportunities for Obama to talk directly to a national audience via television and radio: a press conference at the Palacio de la RevoluciÃ³n following his private meeting with RaÃºl Castro on March 21, and a speech the next day at the venerable Gran Teatroâthe same venue where Calvin Coolidge, the only other US president to visit Cuba, had addressed the Cuban people in 1928.		
The press conference proved to be the most uncomfortable encounter of the trip. Unlike his rhetorically gifted older brother Fidel, RaÃºl seldom speaks in public; indeed, nobody in Cuba could recall a time when he had answered questions from the media. But after Obamaâs repeated requests, Castro agreed at the last minute to participate. According to their apparent agreement, after their opening statements, Obama would take two questions from US reporters, while Castro would respond to a single question from a Cuban reporter.		
But the White House put Castro in the spotlight by picking Jim Acosta, CNNâs aggressive Cuban-American White House correspondent, to ask the first question. Instead of one question to Obama, Acosta asked three, and he posed four to Castro as well, pressing him on human rights and political prisoners. The press conference will be remembered for Castroâs defensive declarationââPolitical prisoners? Show me a list and I will free themââas well as his failed attempt to raise Obamaâs hand in a joint salute when it ended. Pictures of that awkward moment provided âthe perfect depiction,â as Jon Lee Anderson described it in The New Yorker, âof two leaders who represent nations that were once fierce enemies and have yet to figure out how to become fast friends.â		
In his speech at the ornate and beautifully restored theater the next day, Obama preÂ­sented his âchange you can believe inâ arguments to both the Cuban people and government. Drafted by Rhodes, the presidentâs address was carefully constructed to acknowledge Cubansâ pride in their revolutionary accomplishments and their legitimate national-security concerns about the history of US aggression, while voicing the presidentâs own hopes for Cubaâs socioeconomic and political evolution and improved US-Cuba relations in a nonimperious tone.

âCuba has an extraordinary resource: a system of education which values every boy and every girl,â Obama noted at one point in his speech. In a compliment to Cubaâs international medical brigades, he said, âNo one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and sufferingâ around the world.		
Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.		
As Obama prepared his Cuban visit, reporters asked repeatedly whether he would meet with former president Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

Obamaâs humorous chitchat with PÃ¡nfilo advanced a key goal of his trip: direct engagement with the Cuban populace. His deft use of president-to-people diplomacy proved to be the most successful accomplishment of his three-day visit. âHe is a person who knows how to speak without offending,â one taxi driver commented. âUnlike all the previous presidents.â									
 
Obamaâs Agenda
Obama came to Cuba with an ambitious agenda. In addition to forging a direct and positive connection with the Cuban public, he wanted to establish a rapport with President RaÃºl Castro and mobilize economic, cultural, and political forces in the United States in support of his commitment to âwrite a new chapterâ in US-Cuba relations. The president intended his trip, notes American University professor William LeoGrande, to be âa bold stroke aimed at accelerating the process of normalization and making his policy of engagement irreversible.â		
The timing, itinerary, and presidential entourage were all designed to advance that goal. By going now, rather than waiting until heâs a lame duck after the November election, Obama will have more time to use the power of the presidency to deepen normalization. The presidentâs schedule included formal and informal bilateral meetings with RaÃºl Castro; forums with Cuban entrepreneurs and human-rights and democracy advocates; and opportunities to engage Cuban society at largeâthrough TV and radio, as well as by attending a baseball game with some 50,000 Cuban fans.		
Along with his wife and daughters, Obama was accompanied by a large bipartisan congressional delegation as well as CEOs and VIPs from major businesses like Google, PayPal, and Airbnb. His entourage also included politically influential Cuban-American businesspeople from Miami who have been converted from diehard backers of regime change to avid proponents of engagement. Most prominent among them was Carlos Gutierrez, who served as secretary of commerce during George W. Bushâs second term. Gutierrez predicted to reporters in Cuba that, in the wake of Obamaâs trip, US business interests would âbecome more activeâ in pushing the GOP-led Congress to lift the US embargo.

The Speech
In the months before Air Force One landed at JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport, White House negotiators, led by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, worked with their Cuban counterparts to script the summit. Their agreement included two opportunities for Obama to talk directly to a national audience via television and radio: a press conference at the Palacio de la RevoluciÃ³n following his private meeting with RaÃºl Castro on March 21, and a speech the next day at the venerable Gran Teatroâthe same venue where Calvin Coolidge, the only other US president to visit Cuba, had addressed the Cuban people in 1928.		
The press conference proved to be the most uncomfortable encounter of the trip. Unlike his rhetorically gifted older brother Fidel, RaÃºl seldom speaks in public; indeed, nobody in Cuba could recall a time when he had answered questions from the media. But after Obamaâs repeated requests, Castro agreed at the last minute to participate. According to their apparent agreement, after their opening statements, Obama would take two questions from US reporters, while Castro would respond to a single question from a Cuban reporter.		
But the White House put Castro in the spotlight by picking Jim Acosta, CNNâs aggressive Cuban-American White House correspondent, to ask the first question. Instead of one question to Obama, Acosta asked three, and he posed four to Castro as well, pressing him on human rights and political prisoners. The press conference will be remembered for Castroâs defensive declarationââPolitical prisoners? Show me a list and I will free themââas well as his failed attempt to raise Obamaâs hand in a joint salute when it ended. Pictures of that awkward moment provided âthe perfect depiction,â as Jon Lee Anderson described it in The New Yorker, âof two leaders who represent nations that were once fierce enemies and have yet to figure out how to become fast friends.â		
In his speech at the ornate and beautifully restored theater the next day, Obama preÂ­sented his âchange you can believe inâ arguments to both the Cuban people and government. Drafted by Rhodes, the presidentâs address was carefully constructed to acknowledge Cubansâ pride in their revolutionary accomplishments and their legitimate national-security concerns about the history of US aggression, while voicing the presidentâs own hopes for Cubaâs socioeconomic and political evolution and improved US-Cuba relations in a nonimperious tone.

âCuba has an extraordinary resource: a system of education which values every boy and every girl,â Obama noted at one point in his speech. In a compliment to Cubaâs international medical brigades, he said, âNo one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and sufferingâ around the world.		
Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.		
As Obama prepared his Cuban visit, reporters asked repeatedly whether he would meet with former president Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

The timing, itinerary, and presidential entourage were all designed to advance that goal. By going now, rather than waiting until heâs a lame duck after the November election, Obama will have more time to use the power of the presidency to deepen normalization. The presidentâs schedule included formal and informal bilateral meetings with RaÃºl Castro; forums with Cuban entrepreneurs and human-rights and democracy advocates; and opportunities to engage Cuban society at largeâthrough TV and radio, as well as by attending a baseball game with some 50,000 Cuban fans.		
Along with his wife and daughters, Obama was accompanied by a large bipartisan congressional delegation as well as CEOs and VIPs from major businesses like Google, PayPal, and Airbnb. His entourage also included politically influential Cuban-American businesspeople from Miami who have been converted from diehard backers of regime change to avid proponents of engagement. Most prominent among them was Carlos Gutierrez, who served as secretary of commerce during George W. Bushâs second term. Gutierrez predicted to reporters in Cuba that, in the wake of Obamaâs trip, US business interests would âbecome more activeâ in pushing the GOP-led Congress to lift the US embargo.

The Speech
In the months before Air Force One landed at JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport, White House negotiators, led by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, worked with their Cuban counterparts to script the summit. Their agreement included two opportunities for Obama to talk directly to a national audience via television and radio: a press conference at the Palacio de la RevoluciÃ³n following his private meeting with RaÃºl Castro on March 21, and a speech the next day at the venerable Gran Teatroâthe same venue where Calvin Coolidge, the only other US president to visit Cuba, had addressed the Cuban people in 1928.		
The press conference proved to be the most uncomfortable encounter of the trip. Unlike his rhetorically gifted older brother Fidel, RaÃºl seldom speaks in public; indeed, nobody in Cuba could recall a time when he had answered questions from the media. But after Obamaâs repeated requests, Castro agreed at the last minute to participate. According to their apparent agreement, after their opening statements, Obama would take two questions from US reporters, while Castro would respond to a single question from a Cuban reporter.		
But the White House put Castro in the spotlight by picking Jim Acosta, CNNâs aggressive Cuban-American White House correspondent, to ask the first question. Instead of one question to Obama, Acosta asked three, and he posed four to Castro as well, pressing him on human rights and political prisoners. The press conference will be remembered for Castroâs defensive declarationââPolitical prisoners? Show me a list and I will free themââas well as his failed attempt to raise Obamaâs hand in a joint salute when it ended. Pictures of that awkward moment provided âthe perfect depiction,â as Jon Lee Anderson described it in The New Yorker, âof two leaders who represent nations that were once fierce enemies and have yet to figure out how to become fast friends.â		
In his speech at the ornate and beautifully restored theater the next day, Obama preÂ­sented his âchange you can believe inâ arguments to both the Cuban people and government. Drafted by Rhodes, the presidentâs address was carefully constructed to acknowledge Cubansâ pride in their revolutionary accomplishments and their legitimate national-security concerns about the history of US aggression, while voicing the presidentâs own hopes for Cubaâs socioeconomic and political evolution and improved US-Cuba relations in a nonimperious tone.

âCuba has an extraordinary resource: a system of education which values every boy and every girl,â Obama noted at one point in his speech. In a compliment to Cubaâs international medical brigades, he said, âNo one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and sufferingâ around the world.		
Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.

Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â

In the months before Air Force One landed at JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport, White House negotiators, led by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, worked with their Cuban counterparts to script the summit. Their agreement included two opportunities for Obama to talk directly to a national audience via television and radio: a press conference at the Palacio de la RevoluciÃ³n following his private meeting with RaÃºl Castro on March 21, and a speech the next day at the venerable Gran Teatroâthe same venue where Calvin Coolidge, the only other US president to visit Cuba, had addressed the Cuban people in 1928.		
The press conference proved to be the most uncomfortable encounter of the trip. Unlike his rhetorically gifted older brother Fidel, RaÃºl seldom speaks in public; indeed, nobody in Cuba could recall a time when he had answered questions from the media. But after Obamaâs repeated requests, Castro agreed at the last minute to participate. According to their apparent agreement, after their opening statements, Obama would take two questions from US reporters, while Castro would respond to a single question from a Cuban reporter.		
But the White House put Castro in the spotlight by picking Jim Acosta, CNNâs aggressive Cuban-American White House correspondent, to ask the first question. Instead of one question to Obama, Acosta asked three, and he posed four to Castro as well, pressing him on human rights and political prisoners. The press conference will be remembered for Castroâs defensive declarationââPolitical prisoners? Show me a list and I will free themââas well as his failed attempt to raise Obamaâs hand in a joint salute when it ended. Pictures of that awkward moment provided âthe perfect depiction,â as Jon Lee Anderson described it in The New Yorker, âof two leaders who represent nations that were once fierce enemies and have yet to figure out how to become fast friends.â		
In his speech at the ornate and beautifully restored theater the next day, Obama preÂ­sented his âchange you can believe inâ arguments to both the Cuban people and government. Drafted by Rhodes, the presidentâs address was carefully constructed to acknowledge Cubansâ pride in their revolutionary accomplishments and their legitimate national-security concerns about the history of US aggression, while voicing the presidentâs own hopes for Cubaâs socioeconomic and political evolution and improved US-Cuba relations in a nonimperious tone.

âCuba has an extraordinary resource: a system of education which values every boy and every girl,â Obama noted at one point in his speech. In a compliment to Cubaâs international medical brigades, he said, âNo one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and sufferingâ around the world.		
Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.		
As Obama prepared his Cuban visit, reporters asked repeatedly whether he would meet with former president Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964.

Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

But the White House put Castro in the spotlight by picking Jim Acosta, CNNâs aggressive Cuban-American White House correspondent, to ask the first question. Instead of one question to Obama, Acosta asked three, and he posed four to Castro as well, pressing him on human rights and political prisoners. The press conference will be remembered for Castroâs defensive declarationââPolitical prisoners? Show me a list and I will free themââas well as his failed attempt to raise Obamaâs hand in a joint salute when it ended. Pictures of that awkward moment provided âthe perfect depiction,â as Jon Lee Anderson described it in The New Yorker, âof two leaders who represent nations that were once fierce enemies and have yet to figure out how to become fast friends.â		
In his speech at the ornate and beautifully restored theater the next day, Obama preÂ­sented his âchange you can believe inâ arguments to both the Cuban people and government. Drafted by Rhodes, the presidentâs address was carefully constructed to acknowledge Cubansâ pride in their revolutionary accomplishments and their legitimate national-security concerns about the history of US aggression, while voicing the presidentâs own hopes for Cubaâs socioeconomic and political evolution and improved US-Cuba relations in a nonimperious tone.

âCuba has an extraordinary resource: a system of education which values every boy and every girl,â Obama noted at one point in his speech. In a compliment to Cubaâs international medical brigades, he said, âNo one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and sufferingâ around the world.		
Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.		
As Obama prepared his Cuban visit, reporters asked repeatedly whether he would meet with former president Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

Obama used the speech as an opportunity to address younger Cubans directly. âMany suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down,â he said. âBut Iâm appealing to young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,â To applause, Obama spoke in Spanish: âEl futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano.â		
âAnd to President Castro,â Obama continued, looking directly at the Cuban leader, who was seated with other high-ranking members of the politburo, âI want you to know, I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States.â While not apologizing for the countryâs past acts of aggression, Obama owned up to the historical US efforts âto exert control over Cuba.â Before the revolution, he conceded, âsome Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.â But the era of attempts to control and exploit was over, he vowed. âIâve made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend on the Cuban people.â		
In his conclusion, Obama made an overt plea to lift âthe shadow of historyâ from US-Cuba relations and move forward. âThe history of the United States and Cuba encompasses revolution and conflict; struggle and sacrifice; retribution and, now, reconciliation. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future togetherâun futuro de esperanza,â he said. âWe can make this journey as friends, and as neighbors, and as familyâtogether. SÃ­ se puede.â		
Rapport With RaÃºlâand Fidelâs Opinion
On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.

At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

On the street, Cuban citizens appeared enthusiastic about Obamaâs offer of friendship. My informal poll of taxi drivers revealed unanimous support for the presidentâs visit, along with hope that normalized relations would improve the daily lives of the Cuban people. âWe Cubans have a favorable opinion of Obama,â said one hotel receptionist. âHe was respectful, intelligent, sophisticated, and spoke well.â A security guard at another hotel summed up Obamaâs efforts to move forward: âHay que recorder el pasado, pero no vivirlo,â he said: We need to remember the past, but not live in it.

But Obamaâs message received a far less positive reception in Cubaâs state-controlled media, including the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, and the leading news website, Cubadebate. Article after article challenged Obamaâs sincerity, attacked him for minimizing the hisÂ­tory of US aggression against the revolution, and questioned whether he was using âsoft powerâ to continue a policy of regime change. In an opinion piece titled âObama the Good?,â one hard-line political scientist, DarÃ­o Machado RodrÃ­guez, called Obama âprobably the best and most capable person on hand today to mask the strategic objectives of North American imperialism.â¦ There is no doubt: Obama is the soft and seductive face of the same danger.â		
Whether RaÃºl Castro harbors the same suspicions remains unclear. At the press conference, he called Obamaâs efforts to change US policy âpositive but insufficient.â When the two met privately, Castro indicated, he pushed Obama to do more to âdismantle the bloqueo,â which remained âthe most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people.â		
But the distance and discomfort on display at the press conference seemed to have evaporated by the time the two presidents arrived at Latin American Stadium the following day to watch the exhibition baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays. Castro brought his family, including his son Alejandro, a high-ranking officer in the Interior Ministry. Obama brought his family as well; his daughter Malia was seen chatting in Spanish with Castro as they waited for the first pitch. And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.

And the two leaders looked casual and comfortable sitting side by side behind home plate.		
In a finalâand unexpectedâdiplomatic gesture, Castro went to the airport and walked Obama from the VIP lounge to Air Force One as the American president ended his history-making trip. When the two shook hands, their body language suggested that Obama and Castro had indeed established a positive and useful rapport, which should help advance the normalization process.		
As Obama prepared his Cuban visit, reporters asked repeatedly whether he would meet with former president Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban Revolution. At a briefing for the White House press corps in Havana, Rhodes explained that neither the Cubans nor Obamaâs team had raised the possibility of such a meeting. But during an interview with ABC News halfway through the trip, Obama expressed his interest, assuming Fidelâs health permitted. âIâd be happy to meet with him,â Obama said, âas a symbol of theâ¦closing of this Cold War chapter in our mutual histories.â

Although the president traveled to Cuba at the invitation of RaÃºl Castro, in many respects the trip was the culmination of more than a half-century of effort by Fidel to convince Washington to respectfully accept the Cuban Revolution. As William LeoGrande and I report in our book, Back Channel to Cuba, Fidel Castro quietly reached out to one president after another to improve relations. âI seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually sit down in an atmosphere of good will and of mutual respect and negotiate our differences,â Castro stated in one secret message to Lyndon Johnson in early 1964. Obamaâs âsit-downâ with his brother RaÃºl would seem to have fulfilled that hope.		
Yet six days after Obama departed Havana, Fidel delivered a decidedly negative judgment on his visit. In a 1,560-word missive published on state news websites and in official Communist Party newspapers under the title âHermano Obamaâ (Brother Obama), Fidel declared that Cuba, a âdignified and selflessâ country, did ânot need the empire to give us anything.â Referring to Obama sardonically as âour illustrious guest,â Castro dissected Obamaâs speech at the Gran Teatro and excoriated him for failing to adequately address the accomplishments of the Cuban Revolution, as well as the very distinct histories of the two countries. Fidel made his skepticism and continued distrust crystal clear. Obama, he argued, âuses the most sweetened words to express: âIt is time, now, to forget the past, leave the past behind, let us look to the future together, a future of hope.ââ Upon hearing those words spoken by a US president after almost 60 years of economic blockades and mercenary attacks, Fidel noted, âI suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack.â		
To be fair, Obama never said it was âtime to forget the pastâ; in fact, he invoked it repeatedly. âThe simple point he was making is that we need not be imprisoned by the past,â Rhodes noted in an exclusive interview with The Nation. âAnd given that we are working to normalize relations, the decision has clearly been taken to leave that past behind and focus on the future that we can build.â		
Whatâs Next?
What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.		
But Cubaâs transformation is clearly irreversible. The free concert by the Rolling Stones just three days after Obama left was yet another example of Cubaâs complete integration into the global cultural economy. As Mick Jagger told a rollicking audience of more than 500,000 Cubans when the Stones rocked Havana on March 25, âI think the times are changing!â		
In Washington, advocates of normalization are now building on the momentum of Obamaâs trip to consolidate economic and cultural bridges. The presidentâs recent decision to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba will surely bring about a vast increase in US visitorsâeach one of them a potential lobbyist for passing the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, which would lift all restrictions on American travelers, whether for âeducationalâ tourism, as regulations now require, or as simple vacationers.

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â

Moreover, with US companies like Google, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Airbnb establishing a corporate foothold in Cuba, there will be escalating pressure on Republican leaders to allow a vote to end, once and for all, the trade embargo. Even Alan Gross, who spent five years in a Cuban prison for his work on the US governmentâs quasi-covert, Bush-era âdemocracy promotionâ programs, has called on Congress to âgrow a pairâ and âget over the failure of the embargo by lifting it.â		
In both countries, itâs understood that the road to rapprochement is a long one. âTo destroy a bridge is easy and takes little time,â RaÃºl Castro told reporters during his Havana press conference with Obama. âTo reconstruct and strengthen it is a much longer and more difficult endeavor.â In his speech to the Cuban people, Obama echoed that sentiment. Overcoming the past and building normal relations âwonât be easy,â he said.		
âNo es fÃ¡cil,â the president told PÃ¡nfilo. Then again, as PÃ¡nfilo responded more optimistically: âIt isnât easy, but it isnât difficult either!â		
		

What kind of future will Washington and Havana be able to build before Obama leaves officeâand can the normalization process overcome the residual conflicts from the past? These are key questions for both nations. For example, in a move that threatened to undercut the presidentâs entire message a mere two days after heâd left Cuba, the State Department initiated a small, three-year $750,000 program enabling Cuban students to intern at NGOs in the United States to support Cuban civil society. The announcement drew an understandable response in the Cuban state media: “State Department project appears suspiciously like an infiltration plan,” read the headline on Cubadebate, over a large photograph of a Trojan horse.		
With the Obama era coming to an end, Cubans (along with the rest of us) are naturally concerned about what will follow. A huge transition is also approaching in Cuba: RaÃºl Castro has said that he will step aside in 2018. It remains to be seen if Fidelâs negativity about Obamaâs tripâand, by extension, normalization with the United Statesâwill have an impact on the Communist Party Congress this April, which will set new priorities for the countryâs economic modernization and future leadership.

How many times did the US try to assassinate Fidel Castro?  Would US presidents be casual and forgiving of many attempts on their lives by another country?  Exploding cigars, poison, gun brought into his hotel room  by ex.....etc. etc.  Obama: Let&apos;s forget the past and move forward. (Kinda like the Bush era  torture locations and torture initiatives.)  Forget the past and the "mistakes" of the past......For some victims and/or their families the torture is hard to forget?    
    But good for Obama trying to do something  in Cuba after all these many many years.  Awkward.

This is a very good account of where things stand.  I was in Havana with 250 Americans on our people to people Cuba Cruise program at the time of President Obama&apos;s visit and concur with Peter&apos;s assessment of how Cubans reacted.  

In retrospect, the White House would have been better advised to avoid the joint press conference.  Many Cubans were disappointed in President Castro&apos;s handling of the format which could undermine him in the internal debate about how far and how fast.  

President Obama&apos;s speech was eloquent but did have a few missteps that seemed more designed for his audience in Miami and Washington than in Cuba and created unnecessary targets for the hard liners.

The biggest problem was outside of both Presidents&apos; control, the tragic terrorism in Brussels.  The impact of the last compelling day was largely lost to US audiences.  Obama was criticized for not immediately refocusing, most outrageously by MSNBC&apos;s Morning Joe.  I saw no coverage of his moving words about Brussels at the beginning of his nationally broadcast speech, nor of the moment of silent commemoration led by the two presidents at the baseball game.  This is not the first time that the US and Cuba have expressed common concern for terrorism, but it was dramatic evidence that we are on the same side facing this century&apos;s moral and political scourge.

Both the Cuban and the US bureaucracy find it easier to return to old rhetoric and old behavior, as evidenced by articles in Cuba and democracy programs in the US as Peter notes.  

Every candidate for Congress and the Senate must be put on the spot about their positions on ending all travel restrictions and the embargo.  Substantial majorities support President Obama so this is a useful wedge issue.
