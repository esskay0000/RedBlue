WASHINGTON â Toby Neugebauer, a wealthy energy investor, likes Ted Cruz so much that he deposited $10 million into a super PAC designed to boost the Texas Republicanâs presidential ambitions.

On Wednesday, Neugebauer was in Donald Trumpâs camp after the reality TV starâs big win in the Indiana primary Tuesday ended the campaigns of Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

âToday, I am a Trump supporter,â Neugebauer told USA TODAY. âI am excited about the voters he turned up.â

Several Republican donors, including Neugebauer, are moving to unite behind the brash billionaire who vanquished 16 other candidates to emerge as the GOPâs standard-bearer, even as his positions on health care and trade and his harsh rhetoric about women and someÂ immigrants prompted fierce opposition from the partyâs establishment wing.

âI am going to do what I can to help him,â said Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota broadcasting magnate who had contributed money to a super PAC that spent heavily to thwart Trump in early contests. âHe wasnât my first choice, but I think youâll find heâll moderate himselfâ in the general-election campaign.

Other big-money forcesÂ in the Republican Party said they will turn their attention to retaining GOP control of the Senate, in an election year thatÂ favored Senate Democratic candidatesÂ even before Trump entered the race.

Kasich to end GOP presidential bid

The anti-tax Club for Growth, which spent $11 million through its various arms trying to knock offÂ Trump, acknowledged Wednesday that itsÂ fight to stop him was over. Its groups âwill do what weâve always done best: fight hard to win congressional elections for true economic conservatives,â spokesman Doug Sachtleben said in an email.

Freedom Partners, the main political arm of the brothers Charles and David Koch, has launched $3 million worth of ads in Senate races this weekÂ to help Republicans.Â Charles Koch, a billionaire industrialist who is one of the biggest conservative donors in American politics, has made it clear that he isnât inclined to put money behind a Republican presidential candidate, citing the ugly tone of the campaign.

Neugebauer, the son a Texas congressman, said he doesnât know how much of a role he might play in backing Trump.

Trump makes history and changes politics, GOP

Trump has routinely denounced super PACs and has boasted about self-funding his campaign, but itâs not clear how much he is willing and able to spend in a general-election bid that could cost each nominee as much as $2 billion. Trump, who has dominated media coverage of the presidential campaign, has loaned his campaign about $36 million through the end of March and spent far less than most of his rivals on staff, advertising and other campaign expenses.

Neugebauer, one of three main donors to a family ofÂ outside super PACs supporting Cruz, spent little of his $10 million investment during the primaries, sparking a public feud with strategists operating other PACs in the Cruz network.

Neugebauer said they disagreed because he didnât want to run negative ads:Â âWe needed to make Ted bigger, instead of trying to make Trump smaller.â

On Tuesday night, as Cruz took the stage to end his campaign, Neugebauer said he was talking with the super PACâs treasurer about dismantling the committee.

It still had nearly $9 million sitting in its bank account at the end of March.
