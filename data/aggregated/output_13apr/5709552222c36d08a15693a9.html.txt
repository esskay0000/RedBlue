Bill Clinton clashed with protesters during a Thursday event, defending his wifeâs support of his criminal justice measures as president while suggesting protesters supported the murderers of black children.

The 15-minute incident between Clinton and Black Lives Matter protesters occurred at a Philadelphia event in support of the presidential campaign of his wife, Hillary Clinton, according to CNN.

At the event, protesters shouted at Bill Clinton about his wifeâs advocacy of his criminal justice policies while president in the 1990s, which many now believe disproportionately punished African Americans.

At one point during the exchange at Thursdayâs event, Bill Clinton pointed at the protestors and shouted over them:



âThis is what's the matter. I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African-American children.

âMaybe you thought they were good citizensâshe didn't. She didn't. You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter.â
