President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were coaxed from their table at a state dinner in Argentina on Wednesday night to dance the tango. And critics already furious that the president had attended a baseball game in Cuba following Tuesdayâs deadly attacks in Brussels were unmoved.

âThat was a tremendous mistake,â Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on MSNBCâs âMorning Joeâ on Thursday. âItâs fine to go to Argentina, you want to do the work, but youâve got to be careful of these little photo ops and optics. Baseball games and tangos, thatâs inconsistent with the seriousness of the day.â

âObama attacks the dance floor,â the Drudge Report declared.

âFox and Friendsâ aired video of the presidentâs dance moves along with the label âTango Over Terror.â 

âWhen everybody else is worried about where ISIS is, who they are going to kill next, and [if they] are going to come over here,â former Judge Andrew Napolitano said on the cable networkâs morning show, âthe president shouldnât be in Argentina doing the tango.â

Nicolle Wallace, former communications director for President George W. Bush, said Obamaâs reluctance to alter his itinerary âputs him vastly … out of step with the entire American public, not just Republicans.

âHis policy choice was to proceed with everything on his schedule and not to react to the threat of terrorism,â Wallace said on MSNBC. âThere were mothers lying dead while their, you know, family members were at the crime scene yesterday, and to [make it] look like the priority is to go on a foreign trip instead of pausing for a minute and explaining that to America is a communications crime.â

âAs long as theyâre having a nice spring break,â conservative radio host Laura Ingraham snarked on Twitter, âthatâs all that really matters.â

Republican presidential hopefuls John Kasich and Ted Cruz had urged Obama to return to the United States or go to Brussels.

âPresident Obama should be back in America keeping this country safe or President Obama should be planning to travel to Brussels,âÂ Cruz said on Tuesday. âWe donât need another lecture from Obama on Islamophobia.â

Hours before Wednesdayâs state dinner, Obama was asked why he did not cut his historic trip to Cuba and Argentina short in the wake of Tuesdayâs bombings.

âItâs very important for us not to respond with fear,â he said. âWe send a message to those who might be inspired by them to say, âYou are not going to change our values of liberty and openness and the respect of all people.ââ

Obama reiterated the remarks he made to ESPN during Tuesdayâs game, when he said one of the proudest moments of his presidency was watching the city of Bostonâs defiant response to the 2013 marathon bombings.

âThey taught America a lesson,â Obama said. âThey grieved â I was there for the memorial. We apprehended those who had carried this out. But a few days later, folks were out shopping. A few days later, people were in that baseball stadium and singing the national anthem.â 

The terrorist attack in Boston âwas not going to change the basic spirit of that city,â the president said.

âThat is how we are going to defeat these terrorist groups,â he said. âIn part because weâre going after them, and taking strikes against them, and arresting them, and getting intelligence on them, and cooperating with other countries. But a lot of it is also going to be to say, âYou do not have power over us. We are strong. Our values are right. You offer nothing except death.ââ
