It’s often a risky game when politicians attempt to discuss sports because it opens themselves up to completely irrelevant scrutiny.

But Ted Cruz made it too easy.

During a rally at the Hoosier Gym Community Center in Knightstown, Ind., Cruz referred to a basketball hoop as a “basketball ring” right there in that famous gym.

He was measuring the hoop in an attempt to recreate this scene from Hoosiers.



It wasn’t referred to as a “ring” in the film, though.

CruzÂ could have called the hoop a goal, rim, basket or a cylinder (weird, but correct), and nobody would have blinked an eye. But a ring?

That isn’t right. That isn’t right at all.

No one has ever called it a "basketball ring" before Cruz just now in the history of basketball, politics, or words.
