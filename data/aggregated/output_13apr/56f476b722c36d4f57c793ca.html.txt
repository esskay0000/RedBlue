Washington (CNN)Donald Trump spoke on four TV news shows Tuesday morning, delivering a characteristically blunt assessment of the state of affairs in Europe and the world in the face of radical Islamic terrorism.

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it's not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!

We offer our deepest condolences to the people of Brussels and stand with our European allies to offer any necessary assistance.
