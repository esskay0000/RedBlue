Conservative radio host Glenn Beck predicted that the United States wonât âelect another Republican president ever againâ after Donald Trumpâs ascendency toward the GOP nomination.

Beck mourned the future of the GOP on his show the day after the party declared Trump its presumptive nominee and Ted Cruz â his favored candidate â folded his presidential bid, according to Mediaite.

âDonald Trump is the face of the GOP. Well, that makes us crony capitalists. It makes us wafflers. It makes us pretty racist,â Beck said. âIt makes us big government guys. Just, you name it â it makes us that.â

Beck went on to cite Trumpâs high unfavorable ratingsÂ among Hispanics â 77% in a recent Gallup poll â as one demographic shift that would halt Trump and enable a victory by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton this November.

Beck continued:



âBecause Donald Trump is the GOP candidate, and I believe Hillary Clinton is going to win because of this, you will never elect another GOP person to high office every again.

âBecause whatâs going to happen is you are now going to have Hillary Clinton legalize as many voters as you can, the GOP is going to be completely racist â whether itâs true or not â because of Donald Trump. You will never have another Republican president ever again.â
