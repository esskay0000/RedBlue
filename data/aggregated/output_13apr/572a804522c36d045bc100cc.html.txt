Considering the critical issues facing Americaâs public schools, the amount of time the presidential candidates have given over to substantive discussions of our K-12 education system has been pitiful. From high-stakes standardized testing, charter schools, school funding, and zero tolerance disciplinary policies, educators, parents, students, and the general public donât know where the presidential candidates stand. These are issues that have a direct impact on fifty million students and their families in almost one hundred thousand schools across the country.

Last week, at Senator Bernie Sandersâs presidential campaignâs rally in Long Island City, I interviewed Dr. Jane Sanders, social worker, educator, and adviser and Bernieâs longtime spouse. She has served as the provost and interim president of Goddard College and president of Burlington College, both in Vermont (full disclosure: I have volunteered for the Sanders campaign, and I am currently a student at Goddard College). We discussed Sandersâs work as an educator and a wide range of topics in education, from progressive education thinkers like John Dewey and Maria Montessori to hands-on, apprenticeship models of learning. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. 

 
Nikhil Goyal: Talk to me a little bit about your childhood growing up in Brooklyn. I know one of the things Bernie has talked about in his interviews is the amount of unstructured, unsupervised learning and play that was happening.
Jane Sanders: It was great growing up in Brooklyn. The neighborhood was the street. Everybody would get together after school. Somebody would sit out on a stoop and then five other people, 10 other people would come outâa game of stickball or stoopball or dodgeballâall revolved around a basketball or dodgeball. We had fun. It was excellent, because nobody was telling us what to do. We did what we felt like doing at the moment. We had to figure out on our own if there was any dispute of any sort. We worked it out as a group. It was a really good upbringing.		
What made you decide to come to Vermont and Goddard College?
I was also a student at Goddard College before. I think youâve chosen well. Itâs a great school. I read Mother Earth News long ago. They talked about town meetings: one person, one vote. People really had a voice, a sense of community. To hear about Goddard, which is all around progressive education and a sense of community, they had their own ways of making decisions, which included everybody. I just was impressed by all that, and I thought it would be a wonderful place to live. I was right. Vermont is fantastic. Goddard was a joy.		
How would you describe progressive education?
Pretty much underÂ John Dewey. Just having the students have more of a say in what it is they want to learn. You might be studying philosophy, math, or English, but youâre learning about what your passion is. Instead of having there be a prescribed set of studyâthat has a person conveying that knowledge to youâthe teacher, the professor is a facilitator to try to meet your needs and to get you thinking critically and writing clearly and communicating effectively.

It seems to me that progressive education is essentially the antithesis of traditional schooling and what we see in most conventional schools. Under a President Sanders administration, how would the Department of Education function? What would be the contrast to what weâve seen in the past couple of decades with a lot of standardized testing and corporate education reforms?
Weâd be going in the exact opposite direction. No Child Left Behind was a disaster. We donât really believe in standardized testing. I think our purpose would be, schooling is meant to help people be creative, to have their curiosity stimulated, and have them be actively thinking whatever theyâre thinking aboutâwhether itâs the stars, the universe, climate change, anything. Having them be able to feel they can explore anything, learn anything.		
Thereâs a massive movement in New York around opting out of state testing. Two hundred and forty thousand parents last year, or 20 percent, opted out. If you had your child in school right now, would you opt your child out?
I donât know about the extent of it. The standardized tests that they do as a marker is one thing. I think the standardized tests that they say: do you know fourth-grade English or fourth-grade history? I think is a disaster and absolutely would not support that.		
Bernie Sanders, as part of the Every Student Succeeds Actâwhich President Obama signed in Decemberâone of the things [Sanders] was advocating for was moving away from standardized testing and towards portfolio-based assessment.
Yes! Itâs interesting, because weâve made progress with IEPs [Individualized Education Programs] for people with disabilities, or students who need extra help. I think every student should have an individualized educational plan.		
Why should it only be for the special-education students?
Absolutely. As a parent, I had these kids, I didnât know who they were. I wasnât molding them to be me or my husband. What we wanted to do was find out: Who are they? What are their abilities? What are their interests? What are their talents? I think we need to do that in our schools.		
In 19 states we have corporal punishment in schools. Does Bernie Sanders oppose corporal punishment in schools? How would he advocate to make sure that corporal punishment is decreased in schools in those states?

							});
						
We are definitely opposed to corporal punishment. Just like the police, we need to teach them how to de-escalate situations rather than use lethal force. With teachers, we need to have, as part of their training, how do you deal with students that are disruptive in a way that actually helps instead of banishes them, labels them, or hits them. Thatâs not acceptable.		
One of the things thatâs been a major critique of public schooling in the past decade is the corporate education reform movement. Bernie has come out in support of the Chicago Teachers Union and against school closures and high-stakes standardized testing. Bernie talks about the billionaires buying the election process and the economy, and in education, it seems to me that Bill Gates, the Waltons, and Eli Broad are doing many of the same things, just with charter schools and high-stakes testing.
I think that some of them, like Bill and Melinda Gates, have very pure motives. They really want to help. I think that they should be part of the discussion. I really do. But we agree with the Chicago teachers.

One of my final questions is looking at teachers unions. The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Iâve seen that in the rank and file, a large portion of them support Bernie, because heâs talking about the major issues that affect them in the classroom. Obviously, one of the common phrases is: Teachersâ working conditions are studentsâ learning conditions. What do you think of the role of teachers unions in these struggles for educational justice?
Weâre very strong supporters of unions, whether they support him or not. The unions that poll their members, they support Bernie. I think teachers unions are extremely important. Parents need to be involved. One of the things thatâs happening [in unions] is that there is not enough community building, where everybody sits down, as we do at Goddard. You sit down and come to a consensus or an agreement. Itâs a problem weâre having in politics, in union negotiations, and in education.		
Who do you think are some of your most influential heroes in education? Who are the people youâve most been inspired by in your scholarly work?
[John] Dewey, [William Heard] Kilpatrick, Robert Coles. One of the things I like are the people who focus on philosophy as the underpinning of their work.

People like Maria Montessori, Dewey, Rudolf Steiner. One of the things that was emerging in the 1960s, and Bernie has written about this a little bit, was the free school movement. Iâm curious, has that affected you in any way? Did those writings change your vision on education at all?
I was a strong supporter of Montessori when my kids were very little. I homeschooled for a year, and then we did public school all the way through for the kids. I went to Catholic and public school depending on where I lived. I think that education is somethingâit takes place in the classroom. Itâs all up to that teacher. We should be respecting and rewarding teachers.		
We should pay them very high salaries.
We should pay them higher salaries, but we should also be respecting them as doing the most important work in the world. One of the things Iâd like to do if I had the opportunity, weâre doing it anyway, is to look at all the different models of education all over the world. Anybody who has a teenager knows that they donât like to sit in a classroom and be lectured.		
Theyâre very bored and disengaged.
Yeah. But what they do like is they want to play a meaningful role. They want to be a part of their community. We keep them out in every respect. We keep them isolated in school. They canât get jobs, because there are no jobs. And they donât feel needed. In Switzerland, for instance, throughout their school system, they have apprenticeships. Students go to school and learn things and a few days a week, they go out to work. They learn theory and practice and feel they are involved in the community. They are respected. They have different relationships with people outside.		
Itâs hands-on learning. Itâs bridging the gap between the community and the classroom.
I am an experiential learner. That is my bias.		
If Bernie is elected president, what do you think your role would be as first lady, especially because youâre an educator and you seem very passionate about this subject?
I think what Iâd do is try to do the research, find out whatâs happening around the world, whatâs really working, and bring it back. Not as âwe should do this,â but bring it back to the teachers and the principals and the educators and ask them what do you think about this idea and how might we make this American, how might we do this. And have the students and the parents be part of that conversation.		
I see my overall role, if I had the honor, as listening to the voices here in America that are not being heard and putting them out there for people to hear, but also researching and learning some of the best practices everywhere else and bringing them back here and letting them be heard as well. Kind of a megaphone.

Not as âwe should do this,â but bring it back to the teachers and the principals and the educators and ask them what do you think about this idea and how might we make this American, how might we do this. And have the students and the parents be part of that conversation.		
I see my overall role, if I had the honor, as listening to the voices here in America that are not being heard and putting them out there for people to hear, but also researching and learning some of the best practices everywhere else and bringing them back here and letting them be heard as well. Kind of a megaphone.		
		

Jane Sanders: It was great growing up in Brooklyn. The neighborhood was the street. Everybody would get together after school. Somebody would sit out on a stoop and then five other people, 10 other people would come outâa game of stickball or stoopball or dodgeballâall revolved around a basketball or dodgeball. We had fun. It was excellent, because nobody was telling us what to do. We did what we felt like doing at the moment. We had to figure out on our own if there was any dispute of any sort. We worked it out as a group. It was a really good upbringing.		
What made you decide to come to Vermont and Goddard College?
I was also a student at Goddard College before. I think youâve chosen well. Itâs a great school. I read Mother Earth News long ago. They talked about town meetings: one person, one vote. People really had a voice, a sense of community. To hear about Goddard, which is all around progressive education and a sense of community, they had their own ways of making decisions, which included everybody. I just was impressed by all that, and I thought it would be a wonderful place to live. I was right. Vermont is fantastic. Goddard was a joy.		
How would you describe progressive education?
Pretty much underÂ John Dewey. Just having the students have more of a say in what it is they want to learn. You might be studying philosophy, math, or English, but youâre learning about what your passion is. Instead of having there be a prescribed set of studyâthat has a person conveying that knowledge to youâthe teacher, the professor is a facilitator to try to meet your needs and to get you thinking critically and writing clearly and communicating effectively.

It seems to me that progressive education is essentially the antithesis of traditional schooling and what we see in most conventional schools. Under a President Sanders administration, how would the Department of Education function? What would be the contrast to what weâve seen in the past couple of decades with a lot of standardized testing and corporate education reforms?
Weâd be going in the exact opposite direction. No Child Left Behind was a disaster. We donât really believe in standardized testing. I think our purpose would be, schooling is meant to help people be creative, to have their curiosity stimulated, and have them be actively thinking whatever theyâre thinking aboutâwhether itâs the stars, the universe, climate change, anything. Having them be able to feel they can explore anything, learn anything.		
Thereâs a massive movement in New York around opting out of state testing. Two hundred and forty thousand parents last year, or 20 percent, opted out. If you had your child in school right now, would you opt your child out?
I donât know about the extent of it. The standardized tests that they do as a marker is one thing. I think the standardized tests that they say: do you know fourth-grade English or fourth-grade history? I think is a disaster and absolutely would not support that.		
Bernie Sanders, as part of the Every Student Succeeds Actâwhich President Obama signed in Decemberâone of the things [Sanders] was advocating for was moving away from standardized testing and towards portfolio-based assessment.
Yes! Itâs interesting, because weâve made progress with IEPs [Individualized Education Programs] for people with disabilities, or students who need extra help. I think every student should have an individualized educational plan.		
Why should it only be for the special-education students?
Absolutely. As a parent, I had these kids, I didnât know who they were. I wasnât molding them to be me or my husband. What we wanted to do was find out: Who are they? What are their abilities? What are their interests? What are their talents? I think we need to do that in our schools.		
In 19 states we have corporal punishment in schools. Does Bernie Sanders oppose corporal punishment in schools? How would he advocate to make sure that corporal punishment is decreased in schools in those states?

We are definitely opposed to corporal punishment. Just like the police, we need to teach them how to de-escalate situations rather than use lethal force. With teachers, we need to have, as part of their training, how do you deal with students that are disruptive in a way that actually helps instead of banishes them, labels them, or hits them. Thatâs not acceptable.		
One of the things thatâs been a major critique of public schooling in the past decade is the corporate education reform movement. Bernie has come out in support of the Chicago Teachers Union and against school closures and high-stakes standardized testing. Bernie talks about the billionaires buying the election process and the economy, and in education, it seems to me that Bill Gates, the Waltons, and Eli Broad are doing many of the same things, just with charter schools and high-stakes testing.
I think that some of them, like Bill and Melinda Gates, have very pure motives. They really want to help. I think that they should be part of the discussion. I really do. But we agree with the Chicago teachers.

One of my final questions is looking at teachers unions. The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Iâve seen that in the rank and file, a large portion of them support Bernie, because heâs talking about the major issues that affect them in the classroom. Obviously, one of the common phrases is: Teachersâ working conditions are studentsâ learning conditions. What do you think of the role of teachers unions in these struggles for educational justice?
Weâre very strong supporters of unions, whether they support him or not. The unions that poll their members, they support Bernie. I think teachers unions are extremely important. Parents need to be involved. One of the things thatâs happening [in unions] is that there is not enough community building, where everybody sits down, as we do at Goddard. You sit down and come to a consensus or an agreement. Itâs a problem weâre having in politics, in union negotiations, and in education.		
Who do you think are some of your most influential heroes in education? Who are the people youâve most been inspired by in your scholarly work?
[John] Dewey, [William Heard] Kilpatrick, Robert Coles. One of the things I like are the people who focus on philosophy as the underpinning of their work.

People like Maria Montessori, Dewey, Rudolf Steiner. One of the things that was emerging in the 1960s, and Bernie has written about this a little bit, was the free school movement. Iâm curious, has that affected you in any way? Did those writings change your vision on education at all?
I was a strong supporter of Montessori when my kids were very little. I homeschooled for a year, and then we did public school all the way through for the kids. I went to Catholic and public school depending on where I lived. I think that education is somethingâit takes place in the classroom. Itâs all up to that teacher. We should be respecting and rewarding teachers.		
We should pay them very high salaries.
We should pay them higher salaries, but we should also be respecting them as doing the most important work in the world. One of the things Iâd like to do if I had the opportunity, weâre doing it anyway, is to look at all the different models of education all over the world. Anybody who has a teenager knows that they donât like to sit in a classroom and be lectured.		
Theyâre very bored and disengaged.
Yeah. But what they do like is they want to play a meaningful role. They want to be a part of their community. We keep them out in every respect. We keep them isolated in school. They canât get jobs, because there are no jobs. And they donât feel needed. In Switzerland, for instance, throughout their school system, they have apprenticeships. Students go to school and learn things and a few days a week, they go out to work. They learn theory and practice and feel they are involved in the community. They are respected. They have different relationships with people outside.		
Itâs hands-on learning. Itâs bridging the gap between the community and the classroom.
I am an experiential learner. That is my bias.		
If Bernie is elected president, what do you think your role would be as first lady, especially because youâre an educator and you seem very passionate about this subject?

Why should it only be for the special-education students?
Absolutely. As a parent, I had these kids, I didnât know who they were. I wasnât molding them to be me or my husband. What we wanted to do was find out: Who are they? What are their abilities? What are their interests? What are their talents? I think we need to do that in our schools.		
In 19 states we have corporal punishment in schools. Does Bernie Sanders oppose corporal punishment in schools? How would he advocate to make sure that corporal punishment is decreased in schools in those states?

We are definitely opposed to corporal punishment. Just like the police, we need to teach them how to de-escalate situations rather than use lethal force. With teachers, we need to have, as part of their training, how do you deal with students that are disruptive in a way that actually helps instead of banishes them, labels them, or hits them. Thatâs not acceptable.		
One of the things thatâs been a major critique of public schooling in the past decade is the corporate education reform movement. Bernie has come out in support of the Chicago Teachers Union and against school closures and high-stakes standardized testing. Bernie talks about the billionaires buying the election process and the economy, and in education, it seems to me that Bill Gates, the Waltons, and Eli Broad are doing many of the same things, just with charter schools and high-stakes testing.
I think that some of them, like Bill and Melinda Gates, have very pure motives. They really want to help. I think that they should be part of the discussion. I really do. But we agree with the Chicago teachers.

One of my final questions is looking at teachers unions. The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Iâve seen that in the rank and file, a large portion of them support Bernie, because heâs talking about the major issues that affect them in the classroom. Obviously, one of the common phrases is: Teachersâ working conditions are studentsâ learning conditions. What do you think of the role of teachers unions in these struggles for educational justice?
Weâre very strong supporters of unions, whether they support him or not. The unions that poll their members, they support Bernie. I think teachers unions are extremely important. Parents need to be involved. One of the things thatâs happening [in unions] is that there is not enough community building, where everybody sits down, as we do at Goddard. You sit down and come to a consensus or an agreement. Itâs a problem weâre having in politics, in union negotiations, and in education.		
Who do you think are some of your most influential heroes in education? Who are the people youâve most been inspired by in your scholarly work?
[John] Dewey, [William Heard] Kilpatrick, Robert Coles. One of the things I like are the people who focus on philosophy as the underpinning of their work.

People like Maria Montessori, Dewey, Rudolf Steiner. One of the things that was emerging in the 1960s, and Bernie has written about this a little bit, was the free school movement. Iâm curious, has that affected you in any way? Did those writings change your vision on education at all?
I was a strong supporter of Montessori when my kids were very little. I homeschooled for a year, and then we did public school all the way through for the kids. I went to Catholic and public school depending on where I lived. I think that education is somethingâit takes place in the classroom. Itâs all up to that teacher. We should be respecting and rewarding teachers.		
We should pay them very high salaries.
We should pay them higher salaries, but we should also be respecting them as doing the most important work in the world. One of the things Iâd like to do if I had the opportunity, weâre doing it anyway, is to look at all the different models of education all over the world. Anybody who has a teenager knows that they donât like to sit in a classroom and be lectured.		
Theyâre very bored and disengaged.
Yeah. But what they do like is they want to play a meaningful role. They want to be a part of their community. We keep them out in every respect. We keep them isolated in school. They canât get jobs, because there are no jobs. And they donât feel needed. In Switzerland, for instance, throughout their school system, they have apprenticeships. Students go to school and learn things and a few days a week, they go out to work. They learn theory and practice and feel they are involved in the community. They are respected. They have different relationships with people outside.		
Itâs hands-on learning. Itâs bridging the gap between the community and the classroom.
I am an experiential learner. That is my bias.		
If Bernie is elected president, what do you think your role would be as first lady, especially because youâre an educator and you seem very passionate about this subject?
I think what Iâd do is try to do the research, find out whatâs happening around the world, whatâs really working, and bring it back. Not as âwe should do this,â but bring it back to the teachers and the principals and the educators and ask them what do you think about this idea and how might we make this American, how might we do this. And have the students and the parents be part of that conversation.		
I see my overall role, if I had the honor, as listening to the voices here in America that are not being heard and putting them out there for people to hear, but also researching and learning some of the best practices everywhere else and bringing them back here and letting them be heard as well. Kind of a megaphone.		
		

Pretty much underÂ John Dewey. Just having the students have more of a say in what it is they want to learn. You might be studying philosophy, math, or English, but youâre learning about what your passion is. Instead of having there be a prescribed set of studyâthat has a person conveying that knowledge to youâthe teacher, the professor is a facilitator to try to meet your needs and to get you thinking critically and writing clearly and communicating effectively.
Most Popular1A Contested Convention Is Exactly What the Democratic Party Needs2An NFL Player Stands Up to Rape and Gives a Lesson in Consent3As the Religious Right Forces the Gospel Into Public Schools, Some Parents Are Opting to Homeschool4This Is What Happens When Republican Voters Get What They Want5Why Bernie Didnât Get My Vote
It seems to me that progressive education is essentially the antithesis of traditional schooling and what we see in most conventional schools. Under a President Sanders administration, how would the Department of Education function? What would be the contrast to what weâve seen in the past couple of decades with a lot of standardized testing and corporate education reforms?
Weâd be going in the exact opposite direction. No Child Left Behind was a disaster. We donât really believe in standardized testing. I think our purpose would be, schooling is meant to help people be creative, to have their curiosity stimulated, and have them be actively thinking whatever theyâre thinking aboutâwhether itâs the stars, the universe, climate change, anything. Having them be able to feel they can explore anything, learn anything.		
Thereâs a massive movement in New York around opting out of state testing. Two hundred and forty thousand parents last year, or 20 percent, opted out. If you had your child in school right now, would you opt your child out?
I donât know about the extent of it. The standardized tests that they do as a marker is one thing. I think the standardized tests that they say: do you know fourth-grade English or fourth-grade history? I think is a disaster and absolutely would not support that.		
Bernie Sanders, as part of the Every Student Succeeds Actâwhich President Obama signed in Decemberâone of the things [Sanders] was advocating for was moving away from standardized testing and towards portfolio-based assessment.
Yes! Itâs interesting, because weâve made progress with IEPs [Individualized Education Programs] for people with disabilities, or students who need extra help. I think every student should have an individualized educational plan.		
Why should it only be for the special-education students?
Absolutely. As a parent, I had these kids, I didnât know who they were. I wasnât molding them to be me or my husband. What we wanted to do was find out: Who are they? What are their abilities? What are their interests? What are their talents? I think we need to do that in our schools.

We are definitely opposed to corporal punishment. Just like the police, we need to teach them how to de-escalate situations rather than use lethal force.

Kind of a megaphone.		
		

Thereâs a massive movement in New York around opting out of state testing. Two hundred and forty thousand parents last year, or 20 percent, opted out. If you had your child in school right now, would you opt your child out?
I donât know about the extent of it. The standardized tests that they do as a marker is one thing. I think the standardized tests that they say: do you know fourth-grade English or fourth-grade history? I think is a disaster and absolutely would not support that.		
Bernie Sanders, as part of the Every Student Succeeds Actâwhich President Obama signed in Decemberâone of the things [Sanders] was advocating for was moving away from standardized testing and towards portfolio-based assessment.
Yes! Itâs interesting, because weâve made progress with IEPs [Individualized Education Programs] for people with disabilities, or students who need extra help. I think every student should have an individualized educational plan.		
Why should it only be for the special-education students?
Absolutely. As a parent, I had these kids, I didnât know who they were. I wasnât molding them to be me or my husband. What we wanted to do was find out: Who are they? What are their abilities? What are their interests? What are their talents? I think we need to do that in our schools.		
In 19 states we have corporal punishment in schools. Does Bernie Sanders oppose corporal punishment in schools? How would he advocate to make sure that corporal punishment is decreased in schools in those states?

We are definitely opposed to corporal punishment. Just like the police, we need to teach them how to de-escalate situations rather than use lethal force. With teachers, we need to have, as part of their training, how do you deal with students that are disruptive in a way that actually helps instead of banishes them, labels them, or hits them. Thatâs not acceptable.		
One of the things thatâs been a major critique of public schooling in the past decade is the corporate education reform movement. Bernie has come out in support of the Chicago Teachers Union and against school closures and high-stakes standardized testing. Bernie talks about the billionaires buying the election process and the economy, and in education, it seems to me that Bill Gates, the Waltons, and Eli Broad are doing many of the same things, just with charter schools and high-stakes testing.
I think that some of them, like Bill and Melinda Gates, have very pure motives. They really want to help. I think that they should be part of the discussion. I really do. But we agree with the Chicago teachers.

One of my final questions is looking at teachers unions. The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Iâve seen that in the rank and file, a large portion of them support Bernie, because heâs talking about the major issues that affect them in the classroom. Obviously, one of the common phrases is: Teachersâ working conditions are studentsâ learning conditions. What do you think of the role of teachers unions in these struggles for educational justice?
Weâre very strong supporters of unions, whether they support him or not. The unions that poll their members, they support Bernie. I think teachers unions are extremely important. Parents need to be involved. One of the things thatâs happening [in unions] is that there is not enough community building, where everybody sits down, as we do at Goddard. You sit down and come to a consensus or an agreement. Itâs a problem weâre having in politics, in union negotiations, and in education.		
Who do you think are some of your most influential heroes in education? Who are the people youâve most been inspired by in your scholarly work?
[John] Dewey, [William Heard] Kilpatrick, Robert Coles. One of the things I like are the people who focus on philosophy as the underpinning of their work.

People like Maria Montessori, Dewey, Rudolf Steiner. One of the things that was emerging in the 1960s, and Bernie has written about this a little bit, was the free school movement. Iâm curious, has that affected you in any way? Did those writings change your vision on education at all?
I was a strong supporter of Montessori when my kids were very little. I homeschooled for a year, and then we did public school all the way through for the kids. I went to Catholic and public school depending on where I lived. I think that education is somethingâit takes place in the classroom. Itâs all up to that teacher. We should be respecting and rewarding teachers.		
We should pay them very high salaries.
We should pay them higher salaries, but we should also be respecting them as doing the most important work in the world. One of the things Iâd like to do if I had the opportunity, weâre doing it anyway, is to look at all the different models of education all over the world. Anybody who has a teenager knows that they donât like to sit in a classroom and be lectured.		
Theyâre very bored and disengaged.
Yeah. But what they do like is they want to play a meaningful role. They want to be a part of their community. We keep them out in every respect. We keep them isolated in school. They canât get jobs, because there are no jobs. And they donât feel needed. In Switzerland, for instance, throughout their school system, they have apprenticeships. Students go to school and learn things and a few days a week, they go out to work. They learn theory and practice and feel they are involved in the community. They are respected. They have different relationships with people outside.		
Itâs hands-on learning. Itâs bridging the gap between the community and the classroom.
I am an experiential learner. That is my bias.		
If Bernie is elected president, what do you think your role would be as first lady, especially because youâre an educator and you seem very passionate about this subject?
I think what Iâd do is try to do the research, find out whatâs happening around the world, whatâs really working, and bring it back. Not as âwe should do this,â but bring it back to the teachers and the principals and the educators and ask them what do you think about this idea and how might we make this American, how might we do this. And have the students and the parents be part of that conversation.

People like Maria Montessori, Dewey, Rudolf Steiner. One of the things that was emerging in the 1960s, and Bernie has written about this a little bit, was the free school movement. Iâm curious, has that affected you in any way? Did those writings change your vision on education at all?
I was a strong supporter of Montessori when my kids were very little. I homeschooled for a year, and then we did public school all the way through for the kids. I went to Catholic and public school depending on where I lived. I think that education is somethingâit takes place in the classroom. Itâs all up to that teacher. We should be respecting and rewarding teachers.		
We should pay them very high salaries.
We should pay them higher salaries, but we should also be respecting them as doing the most important work in the world. One of the things Iâd like to do if I had the opportunity, weâre doing it anyway, is to look at all the different models of education all over the world. Anybody who has a teenager knows that they donât like to sit in a classroom and be lectured.		
Theyâre very bored and disengaged.
Yeah. But what they do like is they want to play a meaningful role. They want to be a part of their community. We keep them out in every respect. We keep them isolated in school. They canât get jobs, because there are no jobs. And they donât feel needed. In Switzerland, for instance, throughout their school system, they have apprenticeships. Students go to school and learn things and a few days a week, they go out to work. They learn theory and practice and feel they are involved in the community. They are respected. They have different relationships with people outside.		
Itâs hands-on learning. Itâs bridging the gap between the community and the classroom.
I am an experiential learner. That is my bias.		
If Bernie is elected president, what do you think your role would be as first lady, especially because youâre an educator and you seem very passionate about this subject?
I think what Iâd do is try to do the research, find out whatâs happening around the world, whatâs really working, and bring it back. Not as âwe should do this,â but bring it back to the teachers and the principals and the educators and ask them what do you think about this idea and how might we make this American, how might we do this. And have the students and the parents be part of that conversation.		
I see my overall role, if I had the honor, as listening to the voices here in America that are not being heard and putting them out there for people to hear, but also researching and learning some of the best practices everywhere else and bringing them back here and letting them be heard as well. Kind of a megaphone.		
		

Absolutely. As a parent, I had these kids, I didnât know who they were. I wasnât molding them to be me or my husband. What we wanted to do was find out: Who are they? What are their abilities? What are their interests? What are their talents? I think we need to do that in our schools.		
In 19 states we have corporal punishment in schools. Does Bernie Sanders oppose corporal punishment in schools? How would he advocate to make sure that corporal punishment is decreased in schools in those states?

We are definitely opposed to corporal punishment. Just like the police, we need to teach them how to de-escalate situations rather than use lethal force. With teachers, we need to have, as part of their training, how do you deal with students that are disruptive in a way that actually helps instead of banishes them, labels them, or hits them. Thatâs not acceptable.		
One of the things thatâs been a major critique of public schooling in the past decade is the corporate education reform movement. Bernie has come out in support of the Chicago Teachers Union and against school closures and high-stakes standardized testing. Bernie talks about the billionaires buying the election process and the economy, and in education, it seems to me that Bill Gates, the Waltons, and Eli Broad are doing many of the same things, just with charter schools and high-stakes testing.
I think that some of them, like Bill and Melinda Gates, have very pure motives. They really want to help. I think that they should be part of the discussion. I really do. But we agree with the Chicago teachers.

One of my final questions is looking at teachers unions. The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Iâve seen that in the rank and file, a large portion of them support Bernie, because heâs talking about the major issues that affect them in the classroom. Obviously, one of the common phrases is: Teachersâ working conditions are studentsâ learning conditions. What do you think of the role of teachers unions in these struggles for educational justice?
Weâre very strong supporters of unions, whether they support him or not. The unions that poll their members, they support Bernie. I think teachers unions are extremely important. Parents need to be involved. One of the things thatâs happening [in unions] is that there is not enough community building, where everybody sits down, as we do at Goddard. You sit down and come to a consensus or an agreement. Itâs a problem weâre having in politics, in union negotiations, and in education.

I see my overall role, if I had the honor, as listening to the voices here in America that are not being heard and putting them out there for people to hear, but also researching and learning some of the best practices everywhere else and bringing them back here and letting them be heard as well. Kind of a megaphone.

One of my final questions is looking at teachers unions. The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Iâve seen that in the rank and file, a large portion of them support Bernie, because heâs talking about the major issues that affect them in the classroom. Obviously, one of the common phrases is: Teachersâ working conditions are studentsâ learning conditions. What do you think of the role of teachers unions in these struggles for educational justice?
Weâre very strong supporters of unions, whether they support him or not. The unions that poll their members, they support Bernie. I think teachers unions are extremely important. Parents need to be involved. One of the things thatâs happening [in unions] is that there is not enough community building, where everybody sits down, as we do at Goddard. You sit down and come to a consensus or an agreement. Itâs a problem weâre having in politics, in union negotiations, and in education.		
Who do you think are some of your most influential heroes in education? Who are the people youâve most been inspired by in your scholarly work?
[John] Dewey, [William Heard] Kilpatrick, Robert Coles. One of the things I like are the people who focus on philosophy as the underpinning of their work.

People like Maria Montessori, Dewey, Rudolf Steiner. One of the things that was emerging in the 1960s, and Bernie has written about this a little bit, was the free school movement. Iâm curious, has that affected you in any way? Did those writings change your vision on education at all?
I was a strong supporter of Montessori when my kids were very little. I homeschooled for a year, and then we did public school all the way through for the kids. I went to Catholic and public school depending on where I lived. I think that education is somethingâit takes place in the classroom. Itâs all up to that teacher. We should be respecting and rewarding teachers.		
We should pay them very high salaries.
We should pay them higher salaries, but we should also be respecting them as doing the most important work in the world. One of the things Iâd like to do if I had the opportunity, weâre doing it anyway, is to look at all the different models of education all over the world. Anybody who has a teenager knows that they donât like to sit in a classroom and be lectured.		
Theyâre very bored and disengaged.
Yeah. But what they do like is they want to play a meaningful role. They want to be a part of their community. We keep them out in every respect. We keep them isolated in school. They canât get jobs, because there are no jobs. And they donât feel needed. In Switzerland, for instance, throughout their school system, they have apprenticeships. Students go to school and learn things and a few days a week, they go out to work. They learn theory and practice and feel they are involved in the community. They are respected. They have different relationships with people outside.		
Itâs hands-on learning. Itâs bridging the gap between the community and the classroom.
I am an experiential learner. That is my bias.		
If Bernie is elected president, what do you think your role would be as first lady, especially because youâre an educator and you seem very passionate about this subject?
I think what Iâd do is try to do the research, find out whatâs happening around the world, whatâs really working, and bring it back. Not as âwe should do this,â but bring it back to the teachers and the principals and the educators and ask them what do you think about this idea and how might we make this American, how might we do this. And have the students and the parents be part of that conversation.

This interview shows that Sanders has no real approach to education.  She clearly is just making it up as she goes along.  Sanders has no plan or policy to speak of, so she just riffs as prodded by the interviewer.  All the education thinkers she name drops are from generations ago and she pays no attention at all to educational funding, educational disparity, or real issues facing schools right now.  
Corporal punishment as an educational issue?  is that on the burner anywhere?  
The Free to Be, You and me album in the early seventies had more specifics on education than this free association exercise.  
The Nation should not have published so amateur an interview.  The Sanders campaign is nowhere on policy, as this article makes clear.

Jane Sanders absolutely knows what she&apos;s talking about. She&apos;s talking about the most progressive, advanced and practical theories that all the best schools which teach education have been striving to incorporate for quite some time.  As a country it is we whose ideas about education, i.d corporal punishment/you gotta be kidding, are outdated and unproductive.

I found the title to this article inappropriate and confusing.  Jane Sanders seems very supportive of public education.  I wish she and Bernie were going to the White House.  With Hillary it&apos;s going to be more privatization.

Just about ALL of the federal government will be different under President Sanders, regardless of the extent to which we succeed in flipping Congress.

Sen. Warren made this point starkly in a NYTimes op-ed at the end of January this year in a point that seems to escape most, if not all, corporate AND Progressive media.

Further, in his 2007 book, David&apos;s Hammer, Clint Bolick (who was recently appointed to the Arizona Supreme Court by Gov. Scrooge McDucey R-Koch), writes,
"The growth of executive power is even more astounding. Its growth is fueled by a particularly pernicious abdication of judicial power. In Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Supreme Court in 1984 largely gutted the "nondelegation doctrine," which embodied the simple yet vital principle that the legislative power must be exercised by the legislature and that any delegation of such power must be accompanied by clear instructions of how it should be exercised. Instead, [the] Chevron [ruling] ratified the creation of a vast fourth branch of government: executive agencies, exercising sweeping and often poorly defined legislative powers, unaccountable to the electorate, and uniquely susceptible to insidious special-interest pressures."

This is the root of much of the problem we recognize as regulatory capture these days. The bottom line today, however, is that it matter immensely that we elect Bernie rather than either Hillary or any Republican.

There is NO other candidate who even approaches the requisite level of trust voters deserve from the presiding officer of the federal government.

Jane Sanders has some interesting thoughts about education. As to apprenticeships in Switzerland - they are a replacement for High School and university. In Switzerland most professions are learned via apprenticeships, not college. They start after 9th grade and involve working three days a week and going to a complementary school program for the other two days - i.e. business related or graphics arts related among other specialized programs. The intention is to convey the formal, theoretical basis to the hands on experience in the workplace. In turn, every company who accepts an apprentice has to oblige itself to lead the apprentice through all aspects of their business for the period of the apprenticeship, usually 3 years. Pay is a stipend. The higher professions like engineers, doctors, academics etc. are, like everywhere else, learned by going to High School and university.

There is much to say for letting kids have a say in what they learn. But the kids also need guidance. And that depends on how many students there are in a classroom.  That in turn depends on the money invested into education. I think there has to be a bit of realism: no matter how much you may choose otherwise, you still have to learn to read and write, do math and some science - but yes, it should be better adapted to what a student encounters in real life. And yes, kids should be able to have summer jobs, which are a way to work different jobs every summer and try out what a profession feels like as opposed to what it feels like to learn that subject. There is a wide disconnect between subject and the job world. 

What it needs most is to stimulate a kid&apos;s desire to know, to learn, to find out. Without that no education can succeed, no matter how "scientific". Sometimes you learn from what a person relays. Sometimes you learn from protest against what is taught. Both ways are valid. And yes, I agree with Jane that what is most important is that students learn to think for themselves. Whether they think logically, intuitively or creatively isn&apos;t the issue. In the long run the methods will mingle and sort out as what they are: defining what makes sense for them and what doesn&apos;t.

There may not be an ideal way of educating kids and that doesn&apos;t harm so long as things are left unbounded - i.e. free of dogma. Then viewpoints and insights can evolve and change and become richer and denser. That may ultimately be as good as it gets for humans.

Great to hear what Jane Sanders (and Bernie) think about educational philosophy. It is the first thoughtful discussion of education I have heard from anyone associated with a political campaign. I am tired of the billionaires, businesses and corporate type determining how and what our kids should learn. It is worth noting that President Obama and many in his administration send their kids to progressive schools, while the public is in test-driven charters or public schools.

I don&apos;t think it takes a genius to fix public education; just undo all the damage done to it in recent decades and put it back how it was before, except fund it more fairly, instead of by property taxes, which favors the affluent.

When America was at its best during the FDR administration and the postwar years (before it started invading every country in sight, and aside from segregation) the people who made it great received excellent educations in our public schools.  To take one example, look up DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, check the list of graduates in the Wikipedia page.  How many people like that do you think will come out of today&apos;s corporate dominated "excellence academies"?  They are designed for anything but turning out people who can think for themselves.  Rather, their end products are compliant drones who will gladly accept any job no matter how awful for starvation wages (or none at all!) and no benefits, while companies like Pearson rake in gigantic profits for torturing students and teachers alike.  It&apos;s just another cog in the upwards-wealth-transfer project and by now there are truly too many cogs to count.

I also had a wonderful childhood growing up in Brooklyn.  We walked to and from school with our friends and played in the streets, sidewalks, alleys and stoops with no adult supervision.
     The reason most American children don&apos;t perform as well as children in other developed countries is that America was and is an anti-intellectual society.  Hard working students are derided as: nerds, grinds, geeks, dweebs, dorks, bookworms, egg heads, and weirdos.  Most parents view school work as a bother that interferes with extra curricula activities.
     Firing teachers,  closing schools, having more high stakes standardized tests and changes in the standards will not improve our students&apos; educational performance.
The only thing that matter is the attitude of American society toward education.

I quit the teaching profession (high school social studies) because I felt like schools were prisons for the mind, body and soul. (Granted, I worked in some of our nations very worst schools). Most of our schools are indeed corporate-American prisons for both students and faculty. I mostly hated school as a child and adolescent (except for a few classes, like Speech & Drama, Literature, and other assorted fun and/or intellectually-stimulating classes with good teachers). This was public school in middle-class New Jersey, 1970s-80s.
I taught in the New Orleans Public Schools (1991-1992; 5th Grade all subjects) and NYC PUblic Schools (1997-1999 - H.S. Social Studies) --  and it was hell. I have vowed to never again work under fluorescent light -- after working in marketing, too -- Corporate America sucks the life out of one&apos;s soul. It is lethal. No wonder so many teens commit suicide!
I enjoyed this interview, and now I have yet another reason to vote for Bernie -- although I live in Louisiana, one of 7 States in the Union that do not allow its voters to write-in their vote. Unless Hillary&apos;s campaign suffers some unforeseen meltdown (email-Gate?), Bernie&apos;s gonna have to run Independent or ask everyone to write him in -- That would be so cool!
Back to Education -- yes, young people should be, at a certain age, out in the workplace, doing internships, and spending time in meaningful classroom study appropriate for their personality and interests; I mostly slept in class in high school (we had to be there at 7:00 a.m. -- torture!!!). Oh, the misery!
I am soooooooo feeling the Bern!

(It&apos;s a annoying one can&apos;t edit one&apos;s comments on this page -- I see typos in my comment above -- dang! LOL)

Jane Sanders is no more credible on education than any other political advisor. She was never a teacher, lower level administrator, or principle. Although some of her comments reflect insight, they don&apos;t reflect experience. Just another outsider who thinks she has the answers. We don&apos;t need more of this. Teachers need to find solutions, not politicians!

I agree completely.  A candidate needs to have more than wishy washy statements: a year into a campaign and she can&apos;t point to any policy initiatives or bills introduced or legislative history of her husband&apos;s over the past 40 years?  that is pretty damning in and of itself.  She&apos;s against testing?  Why?  What is the remedy?  where&apos;s the reform model?  Where is the strategy for change?

Actually, I believe that she very clearly said her goal would be to gather information about successful systems and research and sit down with teachers and administrators and talk about it.  And btw, you spelled principal wrong.

And it&apos;s interesting to me that you discredit the experience and wisdom of a parent who experienced the system first hand with four children.

Isn&apos;t Jane Sanders great?  It&apos;d be incredible to have her and Bernie in the White House.

Be smart keep Bernie Sanders on the ballot no matter what. 

Hillary is a right winger Democratic Leadership Council Koch puppet pretending to be a democrat.

Tell the Hillary and the ALEC influenced Congress and state legislatures to take a hike.

Hillary and these RINO&apos;s do not want to fix the financial state of affairs that has never been their intent.

Yes Hillary backs privatization in a big way. Bringing the nation back to fiscal stability and putting workers back to work will interfere with that hidden agenda known as privatization. Also known as selling government services to a very few profiteers while taxpayers still pick up the bill.

This sucks.

Privatization will increase taxes,likely provide miserable service and reduce wages beyond belief all of which add up to extreme right wing dumb economics.

In reality:

It&apos;s Time To Repeal The GOP

It&apos;s Time To Repeal The GOP

It&apos;s Time To Repeal The GOP

It&apos;s Time To Repeal The GOP

It&apos;s Time To Repeal The GOP

Keep Bernie Sanders on the ballot no matter what. I want to vote for Bernie Sanders.

Sorry, Jane, that was pretty lame.

Stop trolling and stalking for Clinton.

Decent, honest, knowledgeable, caring people or elitists Slick Willie and say-anything-to-get-elected Hillary.   How very sad that America is choosing more of the same.

I was impressed by our "first lady"

Wow- Jane you are amazing. You are describing the teaching philosophy we have here in an Auckland school in New Zealand. New Zealand teachers  have been fending off the Global Education Reform Movement for some years. Our children are lucky enough to learn through experiences and to have Philosophy as a stand alone subject as well as embedded through the other learning areas. Unfortunately we have a right leaning government and a leader who is very cosy with Obama. Our Prime Minister was one of the first to sign the TPPA, despite a huge protest from the population. Teachers here are very worried about the GERM influence from USA and UK. As a union representative I have been closely watching the political revolution that you and Bernie have been have been spear heading. I hold the greatest hope that the movement continues throughout the world.

Jane Sanders would be the best First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt; she&apos;s amazing!
