(North Carolina Wedding-Cake Bakersâ Version)â©
If I know that youâre gay, I will not bake a cake,
Bake a cake, bake a cake.
âCause Iâm staying true to Jesusâthat I wonât forsake.
So vamoose! Just get out of my sight!
If I know that youâre gay, then youâre not welcome here.
Disappear, disappear.
âCause you violate the teachings that I hold so dear.
I can say take a hike. Itâs my right.
