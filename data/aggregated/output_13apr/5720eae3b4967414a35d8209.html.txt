Among the opponents of Brazilâs embattled president, Dilma Rousseff, who is about to be driven from office, is an interest-group thought to have lost political power over a century ago: slavers. The other day, an article in The New York Times documenting the many crimes of the politicians involved in the impeachment process said this about Beto Mansur, a congressman vocal in his opposition to Dilmaâs Workersâ Party (in Portuguese, Partido dos Trabalhadores, or PT): he is âcharged with keeping 46 workers at his soybean farms in GoiÃ¡s State in conditions so deplorable that investigators say the laborers were treated like modern-day slaves.â

Slavery, of course, isnât the main axis of conflict between the PT government and its opponents. Othersâincluding Mark Weisbrot, Glenn Greenwald, David Miranda, Andrew Fishman, Gianpaolo Baiocchi, Ben Norton, andÂ Dave Zirinâhave documented the many different class and status interests that have allied, using the cudgel of âanti-corruption,â to both deflect away from their own venality and begin the rollback of the mildly redistributionist policies of the PT, which has governed Brazil since 2003. When slavery is mentioned, it is usually as legacy. Brazil imported more enslaved Africans than any other American nation, and was the last country in the hemisphere to abolish the institution, in 1888. As is the case of nations historically founded on settler colonialism and slavery, the PTâs federal economic policy directed at alleviating poverty and lessening inequality is racialized. This was true in 1964, when an earlier mildly reformist government was overthrown in a coup (as my NYU colleague, Barbara Weinstein, writes in her wonderful new book, The Color of Modernity: SÃ£o Paolo and the Making of Race and Nation in Brazil). And it is true today, 56 years later.

But actuallyÂ slavery still exists in Brazil, in the Amazon (as I wrote about in Fordlandia, based on this Bloomberg investigation) and increasingly on the interiorâs soybean plantations. Modern-day slavery is, as an official with the Ministry of Labor put it, a “key part of the globalized, export-oriented economy Brazil thrives on.” Workers are coerced either through violence or debt to provide uncompensated labor and forced to endure the most inhumane conditions.

Blacklisted employers are blocked from receiving government loans and have restrictions placed on sales of their products.â The PT also stepped up efforts to âemancipateâ modern slaves: âIn 2003 a national plan to eradicate slave labor updated the criminal statute and introduced a system of labor prosecutors and judges.â Between 2003 and 2015, âthe government has rescued 44,483 workers from what it calls âconditions analogous to slavery.ââ

The âdirty list,â along with the other abolitionist initiatives of the PT, provoked a backlash by those economic interests who profit from modern-day slavery. In late 2014, the countryâs Supreme Court, which has been steadfast in its support of Dilmaâs impeachers, issued an injunction against her Ministry of Labor to suspend the release of a new list of slavers. The ruling was made on behalf of Brazilâs real estate and developerâs association. And many of those interests, including planter-statesmen such as Beto Mansur, are found among those pushing for Dilmaâs ouster and the destruction of the PT. The BrazilianÂ agro-industryâs main lobbying group, the ConfederaÃ§Ã£o Nacional da Agricultura e PecuÃ¡ria, which endorses Dilmaâs ouster, has been opposing the âdirty listâ for years. An investigation by Reporter Brasil, an NGO that works against forced labor, reveals that the political parties behind the impeachment (including the Partido do Movimento DemocrÃ¡tico do Brasil, the party of Eduardo Cunha, the congressional leader of Brazilâs lower house who organized the impeachment) are the ones that received the most political donations from companies that profited from slave labor.		
The profits produced by slave-labor in Brazil are relatively insignificant when compared to the wealth of the main drivers of the political crisis: elites tied to finance, energy, media, and industry. But the fight over slavery in Brazil does reveal what is at stake in the conflict in extremis. Many of the politicians now seeking to oust Dilma got spectacularly rich, or represent others who got spectacularly rich, during the good times of the PTâs first decade in office, roughly from 2003 to 2013, running through Lulaâs two terms and Dilmaâs first. Yet they never, ever accepted the idea that they should subordinate their particular interests to the larger PT political projectâdespite the fact that it was that project, including mild redistribution, which boosted domestic consumptionÂ andÂ got them spectacularly rich. Soybean export soared under PT rule, giving rise to a whole class of heartland barons, some of whom, including men like Mansur, hold seats in Congress. And despite the PTâs aggressive efforts to eradicate modern slavery, forced labor actually increased under its rule, as the industries that used forced laborâamong themÂ soy, ethanol, and sugarâgrew.		
Slavery, however relatively small to Brazilâs larger labor market, represents the thin-edge of a larger principle: the right of Brazilâs elites to exploit humans and nature as ruthlessly as they will. As isÂ widely reported, Brazilâs twice-democratically elected president stands today a hairâs breadth away from being removed from office, which might happen as early as the first week in May. Her ouster can be called many things, among them a media coup and a constitutional coup. At least in part, itâs also a slaversâ coup.
