The real Hillary Clinton enters the New York subway (Photo: Richard Drew, AP)

Once again, Saturday Night Live poked fun at Hillary Clinton's love of New York â particularly her recent troubles entering a subway station.

"The New York City subway is the best way to get around," Clinton impersonator Kate McKinnon says â before smashing into the gate when her swipe card doesn't work.

Eventually, she gives up: "I'll take a cab."

McKinnon/Clinton â mimickingÂ the Illinois native and former Arkansas first lady who moved to New York to run for the U.S. Senate in 2000 â also wore a Yankees cap during the segment.

Clinton herself has also joked about her subway experience,

âDo me a favor,â ClintonÂ told New York City Mayor BillÂ de Blasio. âWill you just fix these MetroCard slots? It took me like five swipes.â
