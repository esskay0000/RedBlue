The campaigns of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are engaged in another tiresome argument over what will happen months from now, after primaries and caucuses identify a clear winner of the race for elected delegates to the Democratic National Convention.

						});
					
In the meantime, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is busy shredding the candidacy of Ted Cruz and inviting everyone to recognize the absurdity of a Republican race in which conservative elites keep trying to position the hapless Texan as an alternative to the noxious prospect of Donald Trump.				
					
					
Anticipating his overwhelming defeat in Tuesdayâs New York Republican primary, Cruz started the week by offering his supporters a fine whine.				
					
					
Pleading with âTeam Cruzâ to recognize the âsignificant sacrificeâ he was making on their behalf, the senator from Texas complained in an e-mail, âThere is almost no personal time when you run for president,â and griped that âFighting morning and night for the future of our country ensures long nights and early mornings resulting in little to no sleep.â				
					
					
The Texan suggested that his health might be impacted by a busy campaign schedule. And, not surprisingly, he whined that âI face a constant barrage of political and personal attacks daily.â				
					
					
Cruz has always been the most self-important presidential contenderâon either side of the partisan divideâand so it was only a matter of time before he got taken down a few notches.				
					
					
Whatâs striking is the way in which Warren did the job.				
			

							Democrats should seriously consider Warren as a convention keynote speaker, and a vice presidential prospect.
						
 
She did not just note the Republican contenderâs bellyaching. She put it in perspective.				
					
					
âAre you kidding me? Weâre supposed to pity him because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?!â Warren wrote on Facebook and Twitter. âIâve got two words for you, Ted: Boo hoo.â				
					
					
Then she let rip:				
					
					
Know whose health is limited? Workers with no paid leave who canât stay at home when they fall ill or have to care for sick kids. Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who do everything they can to save money but stay up at night worrying about how do get their kids through college without getting crushed by debt. Know who gets no personal time? People who work two minimum wage jobs to support their families. Know who gets no family time? Moms with unfair schedules who drop their kids off at daycare and drive halfway across town only to find their work hours have been cancelled.

And Ted Cruz? He opposes mandatory paid family and medical leave and calls it âfree stuff.â He voted against student loan refinancing. Heâs says the minimum wage is âbad policyâ and heâs done nothing to try and help workers struggling with unfair work schedules.â				
					
					
As for the âconstant attacksâ of a campaign season, Warren wrote: âAnd know whoâs facing constant attacks, Ted? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Theyâre facing the GOPâs constant attacks. Theyâre facing YOUR constant attacks.â				
					
					
Warren concluded by referencing Cruzâs attempt to shut down the federal government:				
					
					
Working people are working more and getting paid less. They canât save. Some face mistreatment and discrimination. They canât take time off work for illnesses or to spend time with family. But they donât whine. They donât throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they donât get their wayâand then turn around and demand promotions.				
					
					
Senator Cruzâyou chose to run for President. Working people donât get a choice. Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your âsignificant sacrificesââand more time trying to do something about theirs.

It was a perfect takedown of a candidate whom the right-wing establishment of the GOP has been trying to position as a credible contender against Trumpâor, at the least, as a vehicle to force an open convention.				
					
					
And it was not the first such takedown by Warren.				
					
					
She savaged Trump several weeks ago with a Facebook post that began: âLetâs be honestâDonald Trump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he kept his fatherâs empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy (excuse me, bankruptcies) to skip out on debt. Listen to the experts whoâve concluded heâs so bad at business that he might have more money today if heâd put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone.â				
					
					
Warren continued: âTrump seems to know heâs a loser. His embarrassing insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, and flagrant narcissism. But just because Trump is a loser everywhere else doesnât mean heâll lose this election. People have been underestimating his campaign for nearly a yearâand itâs time to wake up.â				
					
					
Of all the Democrats in positions to make their voices heard at this point, Warren is the most awake.				
					
					
Wide awake.				
					
					
And she is saying what needs to be said about the conservatives who would be president.				
					
					
Whatâs important is that, while she notes their whining and their failures, Warren attacks the Republicans with a focus on the issues and the ideals that are the most effective tools for countering right-wing extremism.				
					
					
The Democratic Party is in the midst of an ongoing race for its presidential nomination. Thatâs healthy for any party, and especially beneficial for the Democrats in a year where so much media attention is being lavished on the Republican competition. To their credit, Clinton and Sanders are both taking on Trump and, to a lesser extent, Cruz. Their critiques are sound, although they need to develop them as part of continued campaigning for their partyâs nod.				
					
					
Hyper-partisans can and will suggest that the Democratic race should be concluded in order to get the party focused on challenging the eventual Republican nominee. But that challenging work is already being done: by Elizabeth Warren.				
					
					
Warren stands apart from the nomination fight on her side of the aisle, choosing not to endorse either contender. As such, she is perfectly positioned to take Republican rivals apart. And she is using that position.				
					
					
Warren has indicatedârepeatedlyâthat she is not running for any new job this year. But savvy Democrats, whether they are Sanders or Clinton backers, should recognize that Warren deserves serious consideration both as a potential keynote speaker at this summerâs Democratic National Convention and, yes, as a vice-presidential prospect. No prominent Democrat will arrive at the convention with so well-developed and so stinging a critique of the Republicans.

Listen to the experts whoâve concluded heâs so bad at business that he might have more money today if heâd put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone.â				
					
					
Warren continued: âTrump seems to know heâs a loser. His embarrassing insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, and flagrant narcissism. But just because Trump is a loser everywhere else doesnât mean heâll lose this election. People have been underestimating his campaign for nearly a yearâand itâs time to wake up.â				
					
					
Of all the Democrats in positions to make their voices heard at this point, Warren is the most awake.				
					
					
Wide awake.				
					
					
And she is saying what needs to be said about the conservatives who would be president.				
					
					
Whatâs important is that, while she notes their whining and their failures, Warren attacks the Republicans with a focus on the issues and the ideals that are the most effective tools for countering right-wing extremism.				
					
					
The Democratic Party is in the midst of an ongoing race for its presidential nomination. Thatâs healthy for any party, and especially beneficial for the Democrats in a year where so much media attention is being lavished on the Republican competition. To their credit, Clinton and Sanders are both taking on Trump and, to a lesser extent, Cruz. Their critiques are sound, although they need to develop them as part of continued campaigning for their partyâs nod.				
					
					
Hyper-partisans can and will suggest that the Democratic race should be concluded in order to get the party focused on challenging the eventual Republican nominee. But that challenging work is already being done: by Elizabeth Warren.				
					
					
Warren stands apart from the nomination fight on her side of the aisle, choosing not to endorse either contender. As such, she is perfectly positioned to take Republican rivals apart. And she is using that position.				
					
					
Warren has indicatedârepeatedlyâthat she is not running for any new job this year. But savvy Democrats, whether they are Sanders or Clinton backers, should recognize that Warren deserves serious consideration both as a potential keynote speaker at this summerâs Democratic National Convention and, yes, as a vice-presidential prospect. No prominent Democrat will arrive at the convention with so well-developed and so stinging a critique of the Republicans.				
					
					
		

Cruz has always been the most self-important presidential contenderâon either side of the partisan divideâand so it was only a matter of time before he got taken down a few notches.				
					
					
Whatâs striking is the way in which Warren did the job.				
			

							Democrats should seriously consider Warren as a convention keynote speaker, and a vice presidential prospect.
						
 
She did not just note the Republican contenderâs bellyaching. She put it in perspective.				
					
					
âAre you kidding me? Weâre supposed to pity him because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?!â Warren wrote on Facebook and Twitter. âIâve got two words for you, Ted: Boo hoo.â				
					
					
Then she let rip:				
					
					
Know whose health is limited? Workers with no paid leave who canât stay at home when they fall ill or have to care for sick kids. Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who do everything they can to save money but stay up at night worrying about how do get their kids through college without getting crushed by debt. Know who gets no personal time? People who work two minimum wage jobs to support their families. Know who gets no family time? Moms with unfair schedules who drop their kids off at daycare and drive halfway across town only to find their work hours have been cancelled.

And Ted Cruz? He opposes mandatory paid family and medical leave and calls it âfree stuff.â He voted against student loan refinancing. Heâs says the minimum wage is âbad policyâ and heâs done nothing to try and help workers struggling with unfair work schedules.â				
					
					
As for the âconstant attacksâ of a campaign season, Warren wrote: âAnd know whoâs facing constant attacks, Ted? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Theyâre facing the GOPâs constant attacks. Theyâre facing YOUR constant attacks.â				
					
					
Warren concluded by referencing Cruzâs attempt to shut down the federal government:				
					
					
Working people are working more and getting paid less. They canât save. Some face mistreatment and discrimination. They canât take time off work for illnesses or to spend time with family. But they donât whine. They donât throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they donât get their wayâand then turn around and demand promotions.				
					
					
Senator Cruzâyou chose to run for President. Working people donât get a choice. Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your âsignificant sacrificesââand more time trying to do something about theirs.

The CIA Waterboarded the Wrong Man 83 Times in 1 Month

African-American Voters Have an Understandable Reason to Support Hillary Clinton

Brotherhood of Bullies: Bob Knight Endorses Donald Trump

The Orange Rage Monster Acts Presidential

Before âUnity,â Sanders Must Stay in the Fight

And Ted Cruz? He opposes mandatory paid family and medical leave and calls it âfree stuff.â He voted against student loan refinancing. Heâs says the minimum wage is âbad policyâ and heâs done nothing to try and help workers struggling with unfair work schedules.â				
					
					

As for the âconstant attacksâ of a campaign season, Warren wrote: âAnd know whoâs facing constant attacks, Ted? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Theyâre facing the GOPâs constant attacks. Theyâre facing YOUR constant attacks.â				
					
					
Warren concluded by referencing Cruzâs attempt to shut down the federal government:				
					
					
Working people are working more and getting paid less. They canât save. Some face mistreatment and discrimination. They canât take time off work for illnesses or to spend time with family. But they donât whine. They donât throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they donât get their wayâand then turn around and demand promotions.				
					
					
Senator Cruzâyou chose to run for President. Working people donât get a choice. Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your âsignificant sacrificesââand more time trying to do something about theirs.

It was a perfect takedown of a candidate whom the right-wing establishment of the GOP has been trying to position as a credible contender against Trumpâor, at the least, as a vehicle to force an open convention.				
					
					
And it was not the first such takedown by Warren.				
					
					
She savaged Trump several weeks ago with a Facebook post that began: âLetâs be honestâDonald Trump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he kept his fatherâs empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy (excuse me, bankruptcies) to skip out on debt. Listen to the experts whoâve concluded heâs so bad at business that he might have more money today if heâd put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone.â				
					
					
Warren continued: âTrump seems to know heâs a loser. His embarrassing insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, and flagrant narcissism. But just because Trump is a loser everywhere else doesnât mean heâll lose this election. People have been underestimating his campaign for nearly a yearâand itâs time to wake up.â				
					
					
Of all the Democrats in positions to make their voices heard at this point, Warren is the most awake.				
					
					
Wide awake.				
					
					
And she is saying what needs to be said about the conservatives who would be president.				
					
					
Whatâs important is that, while she notes their whining and their failures, Warren attacks the Republicans with a focus on the issues and the ideals that are the most effective tools for countering right-wing extremism.				
					
					
The Democratic Party is in the midst of an ongoing race for its presidential nomination. Thatâs healthy for any party, and especially beneficial for the Democrats in a year where so much media attention is being lavished on the Republican competition. To their credit, Clinton and Sanders are both taking on Trump and, to a lesser extent, Cruz. Their critiques are sound, although they need to develop them as part of continued campaigning for their partyâs nod.				
					
					
Hyper-partisans can and will suggest that the Democratic race should be concluded in order to get the party focused on challenging the eventual Republican nominee. But that challenging work is already being done: by Elizabeth Warren.				
					
					
Warren stands apart from the nomination fight on her side of the aisle, choosing not to endorse either contender. As such, she is perfectly positioned to take Republican rivals apart. And she is using that position.				
					
					
Warren has indicatedârepeatedlyâthat she is not running for any new job this year. But savvy Democrats, whether they are Sanders or Clinton backers, should recognize that Warren deserves serious consideration both as a potential keynote speaker at this summerâs Democratic National Convention and, yes, as a vice-presidential prospect. No prominent Democrat will arrive at the convention with so well-developed and so stinging a critique of the Republicans.

I wholeheartedly agree with Nichols&apos; headline. But it still troubles me that Sen. Warren tiptoes around Hillary&apos;s corruption. The very same corruption for which Warren calls out Republicans.

I am now reading "Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin" the best selling book of the 19th century (except for the Bible) a book to which many attribute the inspiration for Northerners to fight the Civil War, because they understood,  for what they were fighting.  Lincoln is still considered the most important American President.  Lincoln&apos;s  Republican Party was newly formed as a protest party after the 1854 Dread Scott Supreme Court decision, the decision confirming that African-Americans were "property."  After the Civil War and about 20 years of "Reconstruction" the Republican Party abandoned the "free the slaves" cause and became the party of American Aristocracy and Big Business, where it&apos;s been ever since.  It seems the Democratic Party is roughly following the same degenerating historical pattern: After championing civil and human rights for African-Americans from the 1960&apos;s, the Democratic party quietly abandoned that cause, and moved towards a 21st century version Corporate Aristocracy, gradually from the 1970&apos;s, culminating in the 1990&apos;s.  During that 20-year period, black lives and the black family were torn apart.  Family fathers were devastated  by the Democratic Party&apos;s passive  support for unjust crime and incarceration bills -  and Family Mothers were devastated by the Democratic Party&apos;s passive support for  "welfare reform".)  While it is true poor Whites also have been suffering, but, because of embedded social racist elements, the per capita suffering of Blacks was intentionally and insidiously, of a many-times-greater magnitude, than the suffering of poor Whites.   The only hope for African-Americans now, is the rise of young, energetic, African-American intellectuals, like Sandra Bland, a new perceived threat from the perspective of the white-identity power structure and white-identity law enforcement.  Blacks still support the Democratic Party, only because Republicans are worse, having instigated incarceration injustice and "welfare reform" that the Democratic Party passively supported, for political expediency.

We are still in the primaries and there is no reason to think of party unity against the Republicans just yet. However, if indeed Clinton wins the nomination she will need to unite the party, but where is it written that Sander&apos;s supporters should simply give away their votes and get nothing in return, especially when they represent nearly half the party and Clinton can not win without them. Clinton claims to be the "progressive who gets things done" therefore we should expect progressives in her government, which means the executive branch, which brings us to Elizabeth Warren. I think most comments overestimate what can be done as a Senator, and I&apos;m guessing are grossly underestimating the power of the Treasury Secretary. Warren is perfectly qualified: a Harvard Law Scholar, specializing in bankrupty, finance, consumer protection, she is on the Banking commitee, pension commitee.  No banker wants Warren to get within 10 miles of the Treasury Department, for good reason, she is not fooled by anything going on in Wall Street. Warren is the only person I know who can question Fed Chair Janet Yellen and make her squirm in her chair. If Sanders were president I&apos;m certain he would want someone like Elizabeth Warren in his cabinet.

"Warren is the only person I know who can question Fed Chair Janet Yellen and make her squirm in her chair." - Which is why I&apos;ll betcha dollars to donuts Clinton would never appoint her.  Clinton is too obliged to pay the [Wall Street] piper a return favor.

When "we the people" financed Sanders campaign with our hard earned pay, it was an uphill battle with the UN-democratic party and MSMedia fighting us, as if Bernie and his supporters were "the enemy" (were we worse than Republicans? Yes, because Republican, too, are sellouts to the moneyed class, like Clinton and her "DLC party".)  Unity?  You gotta be nuts or naive to think that&apos;s possible by now.  If Clinton represents the UN-democratic  party, the revolution Sanders started will continue without the party, even if Sanders accept her "coronation."  He has to, for the sake of civility.   When Trump beats Clinton, they&apos;ll blame on Sanders, when it was the stupidity of the party not to recognize Sanders as a decent person, and give him a fair chance (they did the opposite) rather than force Clinton down our throats.  That&apos;s the reason why Trump might win.

I could imagine Warren as VP of a president Sanders. They would complement. But as a VP of corporatist Clinton? That seems like a lot of argument and not so much results. For Warren it might in fact tarnish her reputation as a left of center/center potential future candidate who can integrate both - Sanders&apos;s issues and still do justice to the corporations. The latter won&apos;t go away and it would be better to find a task for them in a meaningful democracy. Sanders preferred to vilify them categorically. Warren could bring a modicum of reconciliation for a greater good. 

But with Clinton? Andall the wars Clinton is going to wage, overt or covert to change more regimes and destabilize Iran, Russia and China? That is hardly what Warren could see as meaningful or wanting to be associated with this course of action.

I think Warren is better off in Congress where she can have a real effect and in time run for president on her own agenda, without overhangs from other presidents.

I don&apos;t belive for a second that Warren would be considered for VP with Clinton nor would Warren accept it. If the Clinton campaign is spreading that through social media it is because they are trying to placate the Bernie supporters and Independents whom they will need big time in November.

If only Warren had run for president. I feel certain that Sanders would not have run, and Warren would be winning the nomination handily. I&apos;m very ambivalent about her being Clinton&apos;s VP.  On the one hand, Warren might have a moderating effect on Hillary&apos;s innate corporatism and hawkishness, but on the other, she might find herself muzzled as a principled critic of the administration. On balance, I think it best that Warren remain independent of the Clntons.

It&apos;s hard to imagine anything or anyone who will provide a "moderating effect" on Hillary once she&apos;s running the show at 1600.  She&apos;ll do as she pleases and damn the torpedoes.

If Clinton crashes and burns against Trump, there might be hope for Democratic party reform.  It will weaken the relatively new and insidious DLC elite power structure and the "super delegate" system.   The DLC and "super delegates" were established to install machine politics into the Democratic party.  It started in the Bill Clinton era.  In 1992, Clinton actually "lost" the election, because with 44% of general election votes, he failed to get a majority, because 8% went to insurgent fiscal conservative, Ross Perot,  cutting GHW Bush&apos;s vote.  This country lacks a badly needed Presidential election runoff system.  Instead of working to make that reform, both Republican and Democratic party elites decided to take power from the people, rather than work towards a runoff system.   That&apos;s when the Democratic Party elites started the DLC and "super delegates."  In my opinion,  that was a "democracy anomaly" at least as bad for true democracy as the Republican State voter restriction laws, but much less obvious.  Corporate Main-Stream-Media  subliminal viewer conditioning intentionally makes this anomaly even more, less obvious.  So call me a traitor to the Democratic Party, but The Party betrayed its own Democrat constituents, me included.  Without a runoff system, the TWO-PARTY CORPORATE MONOPOLY  continues, compounding its corporate power OVER true democracy, breeding injustice, voter apathy, etc.  The threats to progress and peace, get bigger, within and outside the United States.   Hillary Clinton&apos;s success in the general election will strengthen this corporate two-party monopoly, as well as the DLC and the "super delegate" machine.  I don&apos;t concern my self about Republicans.  I am not one and never will be.  Quite honestly, I want to see Clinton lose in the general election, so the Democratic party can reform.  Who wins is the voters choice.  My conscience won&apos;t let me vote for machine politics - of any party. In life, I don&apos;t patronize bullies.

correction Perot got about 19%

She hasn&apos;t been around the people and does not understand the power relationship in D.C. long enough to know the ropes.  Sanders has.  Her "radical" stand on capital markets did not win her many friends, made her many enemies, and turned off the politically cautious elites.  It would have been grueling for her.  However, after this season, having Sanders as a guide (and founder of the revolution)  she would be better able to run, if there is a future opportunity.

Elizabeth Warren should remain in the Senate forever, where she does have more power to keep this nation on the right track.   Forget a vice-presidency.

Anything can happen in politics.  Bernie ran knowing he could at least get started with Warren supporters.  If he loses, She could run in 2020, either as a challenger to Clinton, or against Trump, or whoever wins on either side.  Bernie could be her counselor.

The title of this article "frames" our choices; effective messengers should come from any progressive arena, not just "democratic".  For example, Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate has much to say of value to progressive and just choices.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQ8ijQUFBo

Maybe the revolution will shift to there, challenging the Democratic party, as having evolved into an "Aristocratic" party.

Elizabeth Warren, a coward?  Hardly.  Just the opposite. I often wonder about accusers if they themselves aren&apos;t really the personifications of the accusations.  Look, e.g., at Hillary&apos;s accusation of Bernie&apos;s continue fund raising as a fraud.  She did exactly the same thing in 2008.

Hillary did not make the accusation. It was Obama&apos;s campaign manager, David Plouffe. Don&apos;t let your hate influence your facts.

Elizabeth Warren is far too important and useful in the Senate. She needs to continue there and in fact all current democratic senators should do so. The next democratic president will need more than before a democratic majority in the senate to avoid Obama&apos;s fate.

Elizabeth Warren is wise enough to concentrate one the republicans because she has the vision and brains to know what really matters for all progressives in the next elections. We should follow her example and not attack any of the democratic candidates especially when nothing of the kind is intimated in this article.

I&apos;ve been following Elizabeth Warren for a long time.  I read her book and had hope she had ran.  I take issue with the insinuation that Warren is a "party person."  I doubt if her political posture has to do with setting an "example" for us "peasants" to fall into line with the party, right or wrong.  The reason Warren does not take sides is not meant to be an example of party unity.  She is playing high stakes proverbial "poker" because she takes this country extremely seriously and cannot afford to make high-powered enemies.  She would want us to think politically with our consciences, not simply "unite."

Elizabeth Warren&apos;s positions and voice have been powerful, heard and greatly respected.  Were she to become part of a Democratic administration, she would be subject to all its manipulations to maintain their self-serving status quo.  In her current position, she knows the game and how well to make her voice, her agenda heard.  I&apos;m so proud to be a constituent of hers!

Agree.  Obama let some of the "scraps fall from the master&apos;s table" as the parable goes, to Warren, but he did little to help her cause after that, obviously for some major differences on things like the Pacific Trade [corporate] Patnership, and  BO has also been pretty cool and silent on the reinstatement of the "Banking act of 1933" (Glass-Steagall)  which is very important to Warren.

I&apos;m going to throw out my two cents worth and applaud Elizabeth Warren for her tireless crusading on our part. And yes, she would be great as the keynote speaker for the convention. But I feel it would be a huge waste for her to be V.P. This job has very little power to change anything. Keep her in the Senate where she can perhaps actually accomplish some change.

Elizabeth Warren for Vice President?  NEVER!  She&apos;s too important  for that.  If she can&apos;t be POTUS, her work in the Senate is far more useful than Veep.  We need a top congressional leader even if Bernie&apos;s POTUS.

I like Elizabeth Warren a lot, but I am very disappointed she did not endorse Bernie Sanders.  Her endorsement could have gone a long way, but she chose to remain neutral.  Why?  There are big differences between Clinton the corporatist and Sanders the progressive.

She didn&apos;t take sides because she&apos;s a Democrat, not a partisan, and she&apos;s rooting for the Democrat against all the Republicans, as we should all be doing.

Only if the Democrat is not a neo-liberal.

Bull&apos;s eye! Right you are, Fred.

But his "one note" is in harmony,  not a sour note, like "Clinton" The [philandering] Enabler.  Study history and psychology, Susan.

Sorry, wrong column.

No, don&apos;t make her VP now. We should be saving Elizabeth for President in 2020 and/or 2024

Barbara: Because Sanders is Johnny one note. He has the same answer to every problem

But his "one note" is in harmony, not a sour note, like "Clinton" The [philandering] Enabler. Study history and psychology, Ferro.

In a way, yes. The one issue would be justice for the American people and a less oppressive US for the rest of the world. Oh, I guess that&apos;s two issues. Well, simple people see things simply.

You&apos;re talking about hate influencing facts - you should listen carefully to Bernie&apos;s message. Johnny one note? vs Hillary "get things done" that favor the  corporate cash cows?

ï»¿ Elizabeth Warren is a national treasure.  She gives hope to the idea that the Democratic party can somehow be be pulled out of the self-induced death spiral brought on by the DLC - and their willing minions (no names mentioned, of course).

I&apos;m so proud she&apos;s my senator. And I can&apos;t say more forcefully that she should remain in the Senate. She&apos;s a powerful force in the Senate and she needs to remain there to move the neo-liberal Dems back to being the party of FDR again. I think she has more power in the Senate than if she were president. That certainly was the case with the late Ted Kennedy, who was my senator, I&apos;m proud to say.

Elizabeth Warren truly deserves your complimentary article. And I would add, that at this point in our history, I think it is critical that the U.S. Treasury not be handed over to Wall Street once again; Robert Rubin Co-Chairman of Goldman Sachs under Bill Clinton, Henry Paulson CEO of Goldman Sachs under George W. Bush, Tim Geitner President of the NY Fed Resv Bank and the valet like servility toward Wall Street of Jacob Lew under Obama. Treasury is a powerful post with influence on the world and Elizabeth Warren would be ideal, or at a minimum, we need her voice on who should be the next Secretary of the Treasury. It should not matter whether you support Sanders or Clinton, a progressive non Wall Street friendly banker should be a priority at Treasury for everyone. Also, keep in mind, that one year into the next president the Fed Chair&apos;s term will expire and Warren is a voice that must be heard. She knows better than anyone that Wall Street should not be running our economy, and if nothing else, on hearing of her appointment, every Wall Street banker would immediately pee in their pants. If Hillary does win the nomination it would be nice to see Bernie as VP but Warren at Treasury.

why did Warren not endorse Sanders? 1) she wasn&apos;t aware that there is the presidential primary season going on, 2) she didn&apos;t know that there is a progressive in the race 3) she didn&apos;t know she is a progressive (remember she was a repub a few years ago 4) she&apos;s in it for herself, scared of clinton, a coward; someone tell old Liz its safe to come out from under Clinton&apos;s skirt

Sad, John.  This is a woman with more brains than your average political bear.

I think she has a heart and soul as well, rare in a politician.

You&apos;re a moron. Warren is smart to withhold her endorsement - I won&apos;t bother to explain why because you wouldn&apos;t get it. And it&apos;s been 20 years since she voted republican. That&apos;s not some johnny-come-lately. I wish a lot more republicans would see the light and turn into the same kind of progressive as Senator Warren. I&apos;d welcome them all!

With this attitude, I&apos;m surprised that you are not a Trump supporter!  I thought we were here to share and learn not insult other people and their opinions without having the courage to state reasons for your own.

You are not insulting Warren&apos;s intelligence?

You&apos;re right and I&apos;m sorry - I&apos;ll try to be more circumspect in the future.

Agreed! I came here in part to escape some of the ad hominem attacks so prevalent elsewhere in the comments sections of publications I once respected.

I too like civility, but politics is a rough and tumble "game."  If you cannot take the heat, get out of the kitchen (or go to the NY Times comments.)  Ad hominem attacks are not what you are calling it.  They are attacks to the personal aspects of someone, rather than their position (except when their personal disposition affects their position.)  From the web, "adj.  Appealing to personal considerations rather than to logic or reason: Debaters should avoid ad hominem arguments that question their opponents&apos;  motives."

If, in argument, one calls the other a moron, that qualifies as an ad hominem attack.
Joseph

What I don&apos;t understand is why people want Warren in the White House. If people haven&apos;t noticed the presidency isn&apos;t a dictatorship. The pres has limited abilities to force issues through Congress. What we need is a handful more Warrens in the Senate and a dozen in the House. If progressives don&apos;t take positions in Congress then a progressive president isn&apos;t going to get anything done.

Awesomely right on... let&apos;s vote progressive non neoliberals folks into congress to get things done and done right.

Yes, but the pres has significant power through the cabinet to write and enforce rules and regulations, without congress and without "executive orders".  We can count on Sanders to not appoint the same group Bush, Clinton and Obama appointed:  wall streeters, industry insiders, neocons for foreign policy and so-called experts who judgment has been demonstrated to be wrong again and again.  Hillary is an establishment insider who has surrounded herself with these people as senator, secretary of state and candidate.  Bernie could effect yuuuge change this way alone.

Some of the revulsion for Ted Cruz can be summed up with the question  "How likely is it that all of the elements to make a character as obnoxious, immature and Machiavellian could only come together so perfectly in today&apos;s word?   Can you see him existing in an earlier United States?"  That should answer a lot of questions people have in general about the reality that we do indeed have a lot of icky people around.  (Carly Fiorina?)  and they could only have gotten these opportunities since say, the Reagan years.

Now&apos;s a particularly good time to being doing that, Dennis.  Let&apos;s all concentrate on getting liberal Democrats into both the House and Senate to support whichever Democrat becomes President.

Senator Warren is definitely not a DNC&apos;er.  They&apos;d like her to shut up and go away, frankly.  She needs a keynote spot at the convention and a direct line to the Oval Office CEO come January 2017.

Dream team: Sanders/Warren...Thank you John, for not suggesting that Bernie drop out of the race, as the Clinton team is insisting. I always appreciate your columns.

If Clinton and Sanders elected votes are virtually tied, and the super delegates choose Clinton, it will be the mistake of the century in Presidential election politics.

I respect Elizabeth Warren but I am disappointed that she did not endorse Bernie Sanders....I hear your reasons but she could have made a difference in this race.  So does Elizabeth have hidden agendas or is she a "party girl?"  DNC party ?

Read her book on a stormy night, and your eyes will see the light.

She could have made a difference in MA for sure.  Bernie has always been a long shot, and she needs to make sure that she remains an effective senator.  Getting on the Clinton hit list would not help.  I&apos;ll cut her some slack.  She&apos;s hardly DNC.

she&apos;s a coward dead to me

you obviously don&apos;t have a clue.

Then I guess we should be offering yuuge support to Jeff Merkley, who is the only Senator with the courage to stand up for change and support Sanders.  Warren and Sherrod Brown and Sheldon Whitehouse have a lot to answer for.

One size fits all?  Grow up, "all for one; one for all" is not always appropriate for every person in every situation.  Warren has good reasons for being neutral.  Merkley does not.  I love them both.

Sorry, replied wrong column

Karin: "Warren and Sherrod Brown and Sheldon Whitehouse have a lot to answer for."
You mean because they don&apos;t agree with your assessment?

You&apos;re insulting a great lady.

This perfectly highlights one of the main problems with the "party" system.  Either you do as you are told or you pay the price.  Primary loyalty must be given to the party, and not the people they are elected to serve.

true Karin, truth; all cowards, yes they need to held for their actions, a reckoning; with us or against us, that&apos;s the time we are living in

And with that comment we&apos;ve reached the logical endpoint of the Hillary Derangement Syndrome.  Let the Purge Trials begin!
