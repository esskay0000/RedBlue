Donald Trump apparently isn't bothered by the fact thatÂ actress Lena Dunham and other celebritiesÂ have threatened to move to Canada if he's elected president. In fact, he says, he's excited by the prospect.

In anÂ interview onÂ Fox News Channelâs FoxÂ & FriendsÂ Tuesday, the GOP presidential front-runner was asked about Dunham's comments the previous day that she would definitely move to Canada if he's elected in November.

âWell, sheâs a B actor and has no mojo," Trump said of theÂ GirlsÂ star. He then noted that other celebrities have voiced similar plansÂ â and seemed increasingly delighted by the impact his campaign was having on them.

"I heard Whoopi Goldberg said that too â that would be a great, great thing for our country if she got out," he said. "Weâll get rid of Rosie? Oh I love it," he said, referring toÂ Rosie O'Donnell.

"Now I have to get elected because Iâll be doing a great service to our country."

Dunham has been an active surrogate for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. At an awards show Monday in New York, she addressed the possibility of moving to Canada if there's a President Trump.Â "I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will," she said.

"I know a lovely place in Vancouver and I can get my work done from there," she added.
