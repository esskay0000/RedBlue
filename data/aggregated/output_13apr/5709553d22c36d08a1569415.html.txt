Thereâs a darkly funny and truly unsettling moment about halfway through Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, the terrific new HBO documentary, which premiered on April 4, about Robert Mapplethorpe, the openly gay Queens-born photographer who shocked the world with his graphic gay S&M pictures before he died of AIDS in 1989.

His former lover and confessor Jack Fritscher leans into the camera and says, âI have to say that, because nobody will say it.â He pauses nervously, then continues, âNot to put [Mapplethorpe] down, butâ¦Satan, to him, was not this evil monster. Satan was like a convivial playmateââa truck or some construction interrupts himââhaving a jolly good time seducing the maidens.â Fritscher is alluding to Mapplethorpeâs deep foray into a nocturnal world of multiple sex partners and extreme acts. âTo me, it was a bridge too far.â		
But the ominous noise from somewhere continues. Then Fritscher calls, agitated, to someone else in the house, âCan we close the doors? Iâm getting awfully cold.â The audience around meâat the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where a massive Mapplethorpe retrospective just openedâlaughed uneasily at the idea of Mapplethorpe, in his black leather, dropping in from the dark afterworld on a surviving lover just as he divulges his judgment of Mapplethope as a gleeful devil.		
The moment underscores the power of this lavishly sourced documentary by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, the duo that has brought us, among several other documentaries, the runaway cult TV hit RuPaulâs Drag Race. As with that show, this doc enjoys knife-sharp editing, with an eye for stray facial expressions or vocal tics that serve as perfect ironic buttons for intense moments. But what is really important about Look at the Picturesâin addition to its being the first tautly told tale of Mapplethorpeâs life and work for those not familiarâis the frankness with which it re-coronates the artist as a prince of darkness, a title he would surely endorse.		
Almost 30 yearsâand much cultural evolution, vis-Ã -vis queer sexualityâhave passed since Mapplethorpe died, looking for several months prior (as in this iconic self-portrait) like a handsome cadaver as he delighted in the macabre spectacle of his workâs value skyrocketing on the eve of his demise. Weâve lost some of the sting of AIDS since then, the need to frame all whoâve died of it as angels, as we did in the days of ickily well-meaning films like Philadelphia. Such a hagiography might work better for Keith Haring, another gay artist who, like Mapplethorpe, ascended in the 1980s and died, a year after Mapplethorpe, also of AIDS. Haringâs work also embraced gay male sexualityâbut did it with a childlike joyfulness, in bright, stylized colors. His gay images feel of a piece with a life that was about being a beloved and accessible public artist, a painter in New York Cityâs democratic and multicultural streets, with strong overtones of liberty and justice for all.

Those were not the tones of Mapplethorpeâs black-and-white workâeither the graphically gay images or his hyper-polished compositions of black men, cut flowers, or socialites. As an abundance of taped interviews with Mapplethorpe makes clear in the documentary, he had no qualms with disgusting people, using them, or both to create the iconoclastic body of work that secured the fame he so ruthlessly sought. A documentary that aimed to soften his cold, hard edges for a millennial audience new to his work just wouldnât be honest.

Thankfully, thatâs not what we get. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures doesnât shy away from the fact that the artist found beauty in darkness and extremity, nor the fact that, amid the singular pursuit of fame, he was also both creepy and a bit of a creep. âLife is about using people and being used by people, and thatâs what a relationship is all about,â Mapplethorpe tells us. When he talks of meeting Sam Wagstaff, the handsome, older, wealthy curator, who became his lover and devoted himself to cultivating the photographerâs success, Mapplethorpe says, âHe was a very attractive man. He also happened to have what seemed like vast amounts of money. If he didnât have the money, I may not have been involved with him, you know? But you canât separate it. And thatâs what was so good about Samâis he knew that that was part of the package, so to speak.â Anyone who confesses his own unflinching ambition with such calm candor likely wouldnât want to be memorialized as an angel.

But thatâs not to say the film paints a hateful picture of Mapplethorpe. Far from it. Through interviews with his father, sister, and friends from youth, it clarifies the outsized influence that Catholicism, with its sometimes grisly images of bondage and suffering, had on Mapplethorpeâs work. (He was fond of arranging images, or even models, into cross or crucifix shapes.) The artistâs exile from his working-class Queens family feels as much based on his macho fatherâs disgust with him as on his cosmopolitan ambitions. (In the doc, his father says heâs glad that Mapplethorpe never overtly came out to him, as that would have only made matters worse. Thatâs hard to hear.)		
Interestingly, the doc doesnât delveâas does Patricia Morrisroeâs juicy and somewhat contemptuous 1995 biographyâinto the hazing, proto-dominant-submissive relationships, that the slight, boyish young Mapplethorpe had with older students while an ROTC member at Brooklynâs Pratt Institute, a college that in the 1960s was divided between âmanlyâ engineers and hippie-ish artists. (Mapplethorpe quickly made the transition from one clique to the other, walking around campus in a black cape with a pet monkey on his shoulder and embarking on a daily drug habit that would last his whole life.) Those experiences would seem to go a long way toward explaining his future obsession with leather and S&M, and itâs somewhat odd that the documentary doesnât at least mention them.

And though itâs hard not to admire Mapplethorpe for saying that he took the iconic photo of himself with a bullwhip in his anus after an S&M model suggested that if he was going to exploit others then he should exploit himself as well, it can be hard not to cringe when hearing him talk about why he turned, in the late 1970s, to photographing black men. âI often say that photographing black men is like photographing bronze,â he says. âIt became an obsession with me, taking these pictures of blacks.â¦ For the most part, when whites have photographed blacks, theyâve sort of shown them from a certain social point of view. Iâm photographing them as form, in the same way that Iâm reading the flowers.â¦ Iâm not attempting to make a social statement about their plight.â		
Extolling the aesthetic project of the work, Mapplethorpe doesnât seem to know how objectifying he sounds. And certainly his images of black men have been extensively critiqued by black artists and writers including Glenn Ligon, Lyle Ashton Harris, and bell hooks, who has said the works uphold âthe racist/sexist iconography of the black male body.â		
But those notions are complicated, somewhat, in the film when we hear from the funny and exuberant Jack Walls, one of those black models, and who was also Mapplethorpeâs lover for most of the 1980s. Spying Mapplethorpe at an opening of his black-male images, âI said, âThatâs gonna be my boyfriend,ââ recounts Walls, adding, âWe rarely fought, you know, because he was too self-absorbed to really care. It was so easy to be around him, because he was so busy being Robert Mapplethorpe.â		
And regarding 1984âs Ken Moody and Robert Sherman, among Mapplethorpeâs best-known images, we learn from those two models that Sherman was in front of Moody in the photo not becauseâas some have interpretedâit represented some racialized statement, but because Moodyâs neck wasnât long enough for them to do the reverse. The two men, reunited for the documentary, laugh as they recount this. Itâs a reminder that art takes on lives and meanings of its ownâor, more to the point, of our ownâregardless of its creation story.

In the immediate years after his death, Mapplethorpeâs workâlike that of fellow photographer Andres Serrano (of the Piss Christ controversy) and performance artists Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller, and John Fleckâbecame embroiled in Reagan-Bush-era culture wars around censorship and government funding of art. Dramatically framing Mapplethorpeâs importance in pushing forward our ideas about art versus pornography, the documentary opens and closes with those wars, showing us the late right-wing Senator Jesse Helms fulminating against Mapplethorpeâs work on the floor of Congress and the sensational 1990 Cincinnati court trial in which the art museum there was accused of obscenity for exhibiting his workâ to sold-out crowds, natch. (In a victory for art and free expression, the museum was acquitted.)		
Such attacks on his work, as well as his death from AIDS, posthumously positioned Mapplethorpe, in part, as a victimâof homophobia, of an epidemic, of puritanism. Edward, his younger brotherâwho worshipped Robert, worked for him, and followed in his career footstepsâhas the problematic last words in this riveting documentary: âWhatever it took to become Robert Mapplethorpe was what it was going to takeâand it took his life to do it. Literally.â		
Thatâs bullshit. Mapplethorpe came of age in an era of sexual awakening for straight and gay people alikeâbut one in which only gay men, by a cruel twist of nature that sadly dovetailed with homophobic beliefs, died in droves. To suggest that his life was the price he paid for partaking in the very extreme acts that made him famous plays into the belief that he, and men like him, deserved what they got. Mapplethorpe himself would likely recoil at such an idea. A truer remark is made by Edward earlier in the film, talking about the homoerotic images that he, somewhat awkwardly, would soon help his brother produce: âHe loved to get a jolt out of peopleâa reaction.â		
Mapplethorpe knew exactly what he was doing. Even when those around him said heâd never get rich or famous making beautiful versions of dirty gay photos, and even as he shot flowers and socialites to make money, he stuck, with an artistâs conviction, to the idea that his tough, uncomfortable, sexual images of men were what would secure his place in art history. He was right.		
		

His former lover and confessor Jack Fritscher leans into the camera and says, âI have to say that, because nobody will say it.â He pauses nervously, then continues, âNot to put [Mapplethorpe] down, butâ¦Satan, to him, was not this evil monster. Satan was like a convivial playmateââa truck or some construction interrupts himââhaving a jolly good time seducing the maidens.â Fritscher is alluding to Mapplethorpeâs deep foray into a nocturnal world of multiple sex partners and extreme acts. âTo me, it was a bridge too far.â

Spying Mapplethorpe at an opening of his black-male images, âI said, âThatâs gonna be my boyfriend,ââ recounts Walls, adding, âWe rarely fought, you know, because he was too self-absorbed to really care. It was so easy to be around him, because he was so busy being Robert Mapplethorpe.â		
And regarding 1984âs Ken Moody and Robert Sherman, among Mapplethorpeâs best-known images, we learn from those two models that Sherman was in front of Moody in the photo not becauseâas some have interpretedâit represented some racialized statement, but because Moodyâs neck wasnât long enough for them to do the reverse. The two men, reunited for the documentary, laugh as they recount this. Itâs a reminder that art takes on lives and meanings of its ownâor, more to the point, of our ownâregardless of its creation story.

In the immediate years after his death, Mapplethorpeâs workâlike that of fellow photographer Andres Serrano (of the Piss Christ controversy) and performance artists Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller, and John Fleckâbecame embroiled in Reagan-Bush-era culture wars around censorship and government funding of art. Dramatically framing Mapplethorpeâs importance in pushing forward our ideas about art versus pornography, the documentary opens and closes with those wars, showing us the late right-wing Senator Jesse Helms fulminating against Mapplethorpeâs work on the floor of Congress and the sensational 1990 Cincinnati court trial in which the art museum there was accused of obscenity for exhibiting his workâ to sold-out crowds, natch. (In a victory for art and free expression, the museum was acquitted.)		
Such attacks on his work, as well as his death from AIDS, posthumously positioned Mapplethorpe, in part, as a victimâof homophobia, of an epidemic, of puritanism. Edward, his younger brotherâwho worshipped Robert, worked for him, and followed in his career footstepsâhas the problematic last words in this riveting documentary: âWhatever it took to become Robert Mapplethorpe was what it was going to takeâand it took his life to do it. Literally.â		
Thatâs bullshit. Mapplethorpe came of age in an era of sexual awakening for straight and gay people alikeâbut one in which only gay men, by a cruel twist of nature that sadly dovetailed with homophobic beliefs, died in droves. To suggest that his life was the price he paid for partaking in the very extreme acts that made him famous plays into the belief that he, and men like him, deserved what they got. Mapplethorpe himself would likely recoil at such an idea. A truer remark is made by Edward earlier in the film, talking about the homoerotic images that he, somewhat awkwardly, would soon help his brother produce: âHe loved to get a jolt out of peopleâa reaction.â		
Mapplethorpe knew exactly what he was doing. Even when those around him said heâd never get rich or famous making beautiful versions of dirty gay photos, and even as he shot flowers and socialites to make money, he stuck, with an artistâs conviction, to the idea that his tough, uncomfortable, sexual images of men were what would secure his place in art history. He was right.		
		

The moment underscores the power of this lavishly sourced documentary by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, the duo that has brought us, among several other documentaries, the runaway cult TV hit RuPaulâs Drag Race. As with that show, this doc enjoys knife-sharp editing, with an eye for stray facial expressions or vocal tics that serve as perfect ironic buttons for intense moments. But what is really important about Look at the Picturesâin addition to its being the first tautly told tale of Mapplethorpeâs life and work for those not familiarâis the frankness with which it re-coronates the artist as a prince of darkness, a title he would surely endorse.		
Almost 30 yearsâand much cultural evolution, vis-Ã -vis queer sexualityâhave passed since Mapplethorpe died, looking for several months prior (as in this iconic self-portrait) like a handsome cadaver as he delighted in the macabre spectacle of his workâs value skyrocketing on the eve of his demise. Weâve lost some of the sting of AIDS since then, the need to frame all whoâve died of it as angels, as we did in the days of ickily well-meaning films like Philadelphia. Such a hagiography might work better for Keith Haring, another gay artist who, like Mapplethorpe, ascended in the 1980s and died, a year after Mapplethorpe, also of AIDS. Haringâs work also embraced gay male sexualityâbut did it with a childlike joyfulness, in bright, stylized colors. His gay images feel of a piece with a life that was about being a beloved and accessible public artist, a painter in New York Cityâs democratic and multicultural streets, with strong overtones of liberty and justice for all.

Those were not the tones of Mapplethorpeâs black-and-white workâeither the graphically gay images or his hyper-polished compositions of black men, cut flowers, or socialites. As an abundance of taped interviews with Mapplethorpe makes clear in the documentary, he had no qualms with disgusting people, using them, or both to create the iconoclastic body of work that secured the fame he so ruthlessly sought. A documentary that aimed to soften his cold, hard edges for a millennial audience new to his work just wouldnât be honest.

Thankfully, thatâs not what we get. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures doesnât shy away from the fact that the artist found beauty in darkness and extremity, nor the fact that, amid the singular pursuit of fame, he was also both creepy and a bit of a creep. âLife is about using people and being used by people, and thatâs what a relationship is all about,â Mapplethorpe tells us. When he talks of meeting Sam Wagstaff, the handsome, older, wealthy curator, who became his lover and devoted himself to cultivating the photographerâs success, Mapplethorpe says, âHe was a very attractive man. He also happened to have what seemed like vast amounts of money. If he didnât have the money, I may not have been involved with him, you know? But you canât separate it. And thatâs what was so good about Samâis he knew that that was part of the package, so to speak.â Anyone who confesses his own unflinching ambition with such calm candor likely wouldnât want to be memorialized as an angel.

But thatâs not to say the film paints a hateful picture of Mapplethorpe. Far from it. Through interviews with his father, sister, and friends from youth, it clarifies the outsized influence that Catholicism, with its sometimes grisly images of bondage and suffering, had on Mapplethorpeâs work. (He was fond of arranging images, or even models, into cross or crucifix shapes.) The artistâs exile from his working-class Queens family feels as much based on his macho fatherâs disgust with him as on his cosmopolitan ambitions. (In the doc, his father says heâs glad that Mapplethorpe never overtly came out to him, as that would have only made matters worse. Thatâs hard to hear.)		
Interestingly, the doc doesnât delveâas does Patricia Morrisroeâs juicy and somewhat contemptuous 1995 biographyâinto the hazing, proto-dominant-submissive relationships, that the slight, boyish young Mapplethorpe had with older students while an ROTC member at Brooklynâs Pratt Institute, a college that in the 1960s was divided between âmanlyâ engineers and hippie-ish artists. (Mapplethorpe quickly made the transition from one clique to the other, walking around campus in a black cape with a pet monkey on his shoulder and embarking on a daily drug habit that would last his whole life.) Those experiences would seem to go a long way toward explaining his future obsession with leather and S&M, and itâs somewhat odd that the documentary doesnât at least mention them.

And though itâs hard not to admire Mapplethorpe for saying that he took the iconic photo of himself with a bullwhip in his anus after an S&M model suggested that if he was going to exploit others then he should exploit himself as well, it can be hard not to cringe when hearing him talk about why he turned, in the late 1970s, to photographing black men. âI often say that photographing black men is like photographing bronze,â he says. âIt became an obsession with me, taking these pictures of blacks.â¦ For the most part, when whites have photographed blacks, theyâve sort of shown them from a certain social point of view. Iâm photographing them as form, in the same way that Iâm reading the flowers.â¦ Iâm not attempting to make a social statement about their plight.â		
Extolling the aesthetic project of the work, Mapplethorpe doesnât seem to know how objectifying he sounds.

In the immediate years after his death, Mapplethorpeâs workâlike that of fellow photographer Andres Serrano (of the Piss Christ controversy) and performance artists Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller, and John Fleckâbecame embroiled in Reagan-Bush-era culture wars around censorship and government funding of art. Dramatically framing Mapplethorpeâs importance in pushing forward our ideas about art versus pornography, the documentary opens and closes with those wars, showing us the late right-wing Senator Jesse Helms fulminating against Mapplethorpeâs work on the floor of Congress and the sensational 1990 Cincinnati court trial in which the art museum there was accused of obscenity for exhibiting his workâ to sold-out crowds, natch. (In a victory for art and free expression, the museum was acquitted.)		
Such attacks on his work, as well as his death from AIDS, posthumously positioned Mapplethorpe, in part, as a victimâof homophobia, of an epidemic, of puritanism. Edward, his younger brotherâwho worshipped Robert, worked for him, and followed in his career footstepsâhas the problematic last words in this riveting documentary: âWhatever it took to become Robert Mapplethorpe was what it was going to takeâand it took his life to do it. Literally.â		
Thatâs bullshit. Mapplethorpe came of age in an era of sexual awakening for straight and gay people alikeâbut one in which only gay men, by a cruel twist of nature that sadly dovetailed with homophobic beliefs, died in droves. To suggest that his life was the price he paid for partaking in the very extreme acts that made him famous plays into the belief that he, and men like him, deserved what they got. Mapplethorpe himself would likely recoil at such an idea. A truer remark is made by Edward earlier in the film, talking about the homoerotic images that he, somewhat awkwardly, would soon help his brother produce: âHe loved to get a jolt out of peopleâa reaction.â		
Mapplethorpe knew exactly what he was doing. Even when those around him said heâd never get rich or famous making beautiful versions of dirty gay photos, and even as he shot flowers and socialites to make money, he stuck, with an artistâs conviction, to the idea that his tough, uncomfortable, sexual images of men were what would secure his place in art history. He was right.

Thankfully, thatâs not what we get. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures doesnât shy away from the fact that the artist found beauty in darkness and extremity, nor the fact that, amid the singular pursuit of fame, he was also both creepy and a bit of a creep. âLife is about using people and being used by people, and thatâs what a relationship is all about,â Mapplethorpe tells us. When he talks of meeting Sam Wagstaff, the handsome, older, wealthy curator, who became his lover and devoted himself to cultivating the photographerâs success, Mapplethorpe says, âHe was a very attractive man. He also happened to have what seemed like vast amounts of money. If he didnât have the money, I may not have been involved with him, you know? But you canât separate it. And thatâs what was so good about Samâis he knew that that was part of the package, so to speak.â Anyone who confesses his own unflinching ambition with such calm candor likely wouldnât want to be memorialized as an angel.

But thatâs not to say the film paints a hateful picture of Mapplethorpe. Far from it. Through interviews with his father, sister, and friends from youth, it clarifies the outsized influence that Catholicism, with its sometimes grisly images of bondage and suffering, had on Mapplethorpeâs work. (He was fond of arranging images, or even models, into cross or crucifix shapes.) The artistâs exile from his working-class Queens family feels as much based on his macho fatherâs disgust with him as on his cosmopolitan ambitions. (In the doc, his father says heâs glad that Mapplethorpe never overtly came out to him, as that would have only made matters worse. Thatâs hard to hear.)		
Interestingly, the doc doesnât delveâas does Patricia Morrisroeâs juicy and somewhat contemptuous 1995 biographyâinto the hazing, proto-dominant-submissive relationships, that the slight, boyish young Mapplethorpe had with older students while an ROTC member at Brooklynâs Pratt Institute, a college that in the 1960s was divided between âmanlyâ engineers and hippie-ish artists. (Mapplethorpe quickly made the transition from one clique to the other, walking around campus in a black cape with a pet monkey on his shoulder and embarking on a daily drug habit that would last his whole life.) Those experiences would seem to go a long way toward explaining his future obsession with leather and S&M, and itâs somewhat odd that the documentary doesnât at least mention them.

And though itâs hard not to admire Mapplethorpe for saying that he took the iconic photo of himself with a bullwhip in his anus after an S&M model suggested that if he was going to exploit others then he should exploit himself as well, it can be hard not to cringe when hearing him talk about why he turned, in the late 1970s, to photographing black men. âI often say that photographing black men is like photographing bronze,â he says. âIt became an obsession with me, taking these pictures of blacks.â¦ For the most part, when whites have photographed blacks, theyâve sort of shown them from a certain social point of view. Iâm photographing them as form, in the same way that Iâm reading the flowers.â¦ Iâm not attempting to make a social statement about their plight.â		
Extolling the aesthetic project of the work, Mapplethorpe doesnât seem to know how objectifying he sounds. And certainly his images of black men have been extensively critiqued by black artists and writers including Glenn Ligon, Lyle Ashton Harris, and bell hooks, who has said the works uphold âthe racist/sexist iconography of the black male body.â		
But those notions are complicated, somewhat, in the film when we hear from the funny and exuberant Jack Walls, one of those black models, and who was also Mapplethorpeâs lover for most of the 1980s. Spying Mapplethorpe at an opening of his black-male images, âI said, âThatâs gonna be my boyfriend,ââ recounts Walls, adding, âWe rarely fought, you know, because he was too self-absorbed to really care. It was so easy to be around him, because he was so busy being Robert Mapplethorpe.â		
And regarding 1984âs Ken Moody and Robert Sherman, among Mapplethorpeâs best-known images, we learn from those two models that Sherman was in front of Moody in the photo not becauseâas some have interpretedâit represented some racialized statement, but because Moodyâs neck wasnât long enough for them to do the reverse. The two men, reunited for the documentary, laugh as they recount this. Itâs a reminder that art takes on lives and meanings of its ownâor, more to the point, of our ownâregardless of its creation story.

A truer remark is made by Edward earlier in the film, talking about the homoerotic images that he, somewhat awkwardly, would soon help his brother produce: âHe loved to get a jolt out of peopleâa reaction.â		
Mapplethorpe knew exactly what he was doing. Even when those around him said heâd never get rich or famous making beautiful versions of dirty gay photos, and even as he shot flowers and socialites to make money, he stuck, with an artistâs conviction, to the idea that his tough, uncomfortable, sexual images of men were what would secure his place in art history. He was right.		
		

And though itâs hard not to admire Mapplethorpe for saying that he took the iconic photo of himself with a bullwhip in his anus after an S&M model suggested that if he was going to exploit others then he should exploit himself as well, it can be hard not to cringe when hearing him talk about why he turned, in the late 1970s, to photographing black men. âI often say that photographing black men is like photographing bronze,â he says. âIt became an obsession with me, taking these pictures of blacks.â¦ For the most part, when whites have photographed blacks, theyâve sort of shown them from a certain social point of view. Iâm photographing them as form, in the same way that Iâm reading the flowers.â¦ Iâm not attempting to make a social statement about their plight.â		
Extolling the aesthetic project of the work, Mapplethorpe doesnât seem to know how objectifying he sounds. And certainly his images of black men have been extensively critiqued by black artists and writers including Glenn Ligon, Lyle Ashton Harris, and bell hooks, who has said the works uphold âthe racist/sexist iconography of the black male body.â		
But those notions are complicated, somewhat, in the film when we hear from the funny and exuberant Jack Walls, one of those black models, and who was also Mapplethorpeâs lover for most of the 1980s. Spying Mapplethorpe at an opening of his black-male images, âI said, âThatâs gonna be my boyfriend,ââ recounts Walls, adding, âWe rarely fought, you know, because he was too self-absorbed to really care. It was so easy to be around him, because he was so busy being Robert Mapplethorpe.â		
And regarding 1984âs Ken Moody and Robert Sherman, among Mapplethorpeâs best-known images, we learn from those two models that Sherman was in front of Moody in the photo not becauseâas some have interpretedâit represented some racialized statement, but because Moodyâs neck wasnât long enough for them to do the reverse. The two men, reunited for the documentary, laugh as they recount this. Itâs a reminder that art takes on lives and meanings of its ownâor, more to the point, of our ownâregardless of its creation story.

In the immediate years after his death, Mapplethorpeâs workâlike that of fellow photographer Andres Serrano (of the Piss Christ controversy) and performance artists Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller, and John Fleckâbecame embroiled in Reagan-Bush-era culture wars around censorship and government funding of art. Dramatically framing Mapplethorpeâs importance in pushing forward our ideas about art versus pornography, the documentary opens and closes with those wars, showing us the late right-wing Senator Jesse Helms fulminating against Mapplethorpeâs work on the floor of Congress and the sensational 1990 Cincinnati court trial in which the art museum there was accused of obscenity for exhibiting his workâ to sold-out crowds, natch. (In a victory for art and free expression, the museum was acquitted.)		
Such attacks on his work, as well as his death from AIDS, posthumously positioned Mapplethorpe, in part, as a victimâof homophobia, of an epidemic, of puritanism. Edward, his younger brotherâwho worshipped Robert, worked for him, and followed in his career footstepsâhas the problematic last words in this riveting documentary: âWhatever it took to become Robert Mapplethorpe was what it was going to takeâand it took his life to do it. Literally.â		
Thatâs bullshit. Mapplethorpe came of age in an era of sexual awakening for straight and gay people alikeâbut one in which only gay men, by a cruel twist of nature that sadly dovetailed with homophobic beliefs, died in droves. To suggest that his life was the price he paid for partaking in the very extreme acts that made him famous plays into the belief that he, and men like him, deserved what they got.

Well alright, the hagiography continues, and the Eighties&apos; mastery of self indulgence turns ordinary work into masterpieces. But I see no need to call out Maplethorpe in particular for objectifying his subjects. A work of art is an object. The human body is an object. Whatever else we are, we are also objects. It&apos;s a fundamental right of a sculptor to think of the human body as an object. Most of know that it&apos;s also a living being, a friend, a woman, or man etc. 

Selecting a subject for the tones of their skin is no more demeaning than painting a sky for its colors. At the moment of creation the artist exists in their own world.
There is no morality in art. There is only good art, or bad art. (Paraphrased from Wilde).

I don&apos;t find anything icky about "Philadelphia"  I found Mapplethorpe&apos;s crucifix in urine quite icky.  Despite his photos of beautiful flowers, in the 1980&apos;s I found him generally a negative, self-indulgent person who insisted on doing his thing while the far right threw it in everybody&apos;s faces.  Just what we needed, a guy getting money for working through his issues with Catholicism in New York while gay men were dying everywhere.   I&apos;m from around the ground zero population in LA and was in the first study to isolate the virus at UCLA in 84.  Mapplethorpe is as much a waste of time as is calling people like myself "queer."  Moving right along....

Did you actually like him or were you more likely my little Tory troll who flatters me at every turn?
