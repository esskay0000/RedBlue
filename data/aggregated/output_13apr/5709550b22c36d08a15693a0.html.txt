Happy Saturday, For the Record peeps! Bernie Sanders took some time out from his busy schedule to watch "Hamilton"Â last night, so we're taking some time out from our not-as-busy schedule to create the Ten Campaign Commandments*Â for you current/future politicians out there. After all, there's reckoning to be reckoned.

The longer a campaign goes, the more chances you'll haveÂ to offend the person(s) you're running against. That goes both ways, so at some point,Â you're going to start demanding that they tell the truth (whether you are in the right about this is an entirely different matter). This week, the candidate demanding the most satisfaction isÂ Bernie Sanders,Â as he continues to battle it out with Hillary ClintonÂ for the Democratic nomination. His latest affront:Â "I regret less than she does."Â Ouch.

You're going to need people you trust on your side. You'll never make it through otherwise. For Clinton, that'sÂ right-hand woman Huma Abedin, who recently gave a rare interviewÂ on the "Call Your Girlfriend"Â podcast and revealed how they are obsessed with food, among other things. Interested in learning how not toÂ pick your second?Â Observe the practices of Republican John Kasich and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

For those primary debates. Prepare yourself, becauseÂ you may very wellÂ get caught in a "Groundhog Day"-esque loop, in which you talk about the same things over and over and over again and the only things that really change are the soundbites the media decides to highlight this go-round. The next one to watch:Â the Democratic debate on Thursday in Brooklyn, five days before the New York primary.

When you're a candidate, remember, we can all agree that duels are dumb and immature, sure. Which is why we don't need guns at the GOP national convention, right? Right (says the Secret Service).

Of the next day, anyway. The campaign version of duels: Basically all of the primaries and caucuses you'll hear about for months on end. The latest results from this cycle: Republican front-runnerÂ Donald Trump and the not-Democratic-front-runnerÂ Sanders won the Wisconsin primaries on Tuesday.Â Sanders and Clinton are aiming for 14 whole delegates inÂ today's Wyoming DemÂ caucuses.

If there's anyone who is going to need to be as into your campaign as you, it's your spouse/significant other. This may or may not backfire on you. Your person could be a former president himselfÂ who suggests that some Black Lives Matter protesters support the murderers of black children. Or your wifeÂ may openly question your Twitter retweeting addiction in public and say she, along with much of America,Â wishes you would act more presidential.

Maybe you'll even get to tell your misdeedsÂ to the pope himself, whether you agree with him on certain issues or not. Right, Bernie?

Be sure to bring up constantly what a good negotiator you are, a la the Donald. You're so good at what you do thatÂ you are going to take creditÂ for the success of the campaign of another candidate from the other party. Polls may come out that sayÂ seven out of 10 Americans have an unfavorable view of you.Â Ignore the haters, even if they happen to include the current president,Â who is most certain that you will not be his successor.

For the moments when you can't get away, recognize that you did this to yourself. Ted Cruz knows he's the one who said the words "New York values" in an insulting manner a few months ago, and no matter the dings that it may result in come the state's primary on April 19,Â he's not shying away from his past phrasing. Instead, he's doing what any good politician does: He's putting a spin on it, saying that he was talking about the Democratic politics of the state.

And always remember: It's a long haul. For all the steps you've taken to get to the nomination, there are so many, many more to go. November is going to feel a long ways away for a long time.

*Inspired byÂ "Ten Duel Commandments,"Â of course. Thanks,Â Lin-Manuel Miranda!

I'm taking a moment to stop using the royal we to say farewell. I've been writing the weekly roundups, as well as the Friday morning and sometimes other random morning editions (even journalists need vacations), since we launched last September. After writing about these political animals,Â I'm off to a part of the journalism worldÂ that (at least part of the time)Â focuses on literal animals. Will I miss the debates and other campaign shenanigans? In a strange, twisted way, yes. But I'll miss making jokes about them while trying to fit in as many musical and rom-com references as possible much, much more. For the Record's in fabulous hands, though, and I couldn't have asked for better people to work with thanÂ BrettÂ andÂ Joanna.

So, I won't see you Monday morningÂ in your inboxesÂ this time around.

Thanks for reading anyway.

âÂ Jessica
