The allegations against the man were serious indeed.

Donald Rumsfeld said he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two personâ in Al Qaeda.
The Central Intelligence Agency informed Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee that he âserved as Usama Bin Ladenâs senior lieutenant. In that capacity, he has managed a network of training campsâ¦. He also acted as al-Qaedaâs coordinator of external contacts and foreign communications.â
CIA Director Michael Hayden would tell the press in 2008 that 25 percent of all the information his agency had gathered about Al Qaeda from human sources âoriginatedâ with one other detainee and him.
George W. Bush would use his case to justify the CIAâs âenhanced interrogation program,â claiming that âhe had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ and that âhe helped smuggle al-Qaeda leaders out of Afghanistanâ so they would not be captured by US military forces.

None of it was true.

And even if it had been true, what the CIA did to Abu Zubaydahâwith the knowledge and approval of the highest government officialsâis a prime example of the kind of still-unpunished crimes that officials like Dick Cheney, George Bush, and Donald Rumsfeld committed in the so-called Global War on Terror.		
So who was this infamous figure, and where is he now? His name is Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, but he is better known by his Arabic nickname, Abu Zubaydah. And as far as we know, he is still in solitary detention in GuantÃ¡namo.		
A Saudi national, in the 1980s Zubaydah helped run the Khaldan camp, a mujahedeen training facility set up in Afghanistan with CIA help during the Soviet occupation of that country. In other words, Zubaydah was then an American ally in the fight against the Soviets, one of President Ronald Reaganâs âfreedom fighters.â (But then again, so in effect was Osama bin Laden.)

Zubaydahâs later fate in the hands of the CIA was of a far grimmer nature. He had the dubious luck to be the subject of a number of CIA âfirstsâ: the first postâ9/11 prisoner to be waterboarded; the first to be experimented on by psychologists working as CIA contractors; one of the first of the Agencyâs âghost prisonersâ (detainees hidden from the world, including the International Committee of the Red Cross which, under the Geneva Conventions, must be allowed access to every prisoner of war); and one of the first prisoners to be cited in a memo written by Jay Bybee for the Bush administration on what the CIA could âlegallyâ do to a detainee without supposedly violating US federal laws against torture.		
Zubaydahâs story isâor at least should beâthe iconic tale of the illegal extremes to which the Bush administration and the CIA went in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. And yet former officials, from CIA head Michael Hayden to Vice President Dick Cheney to George W. Bush himself, have presented it as a glowing example of the use of âenhanced interrogation techniquesâ to extract desperately needed information from the âevildoersâ of that time.		
Zubaydah was an early experiment in postâ9/11 CIA practices and hereâs the remarkable thing (though it has yet to become part of the mainstream media accounts of his case): it was all a big lie. Zubaydah wasnât involved with Al Qaeda; he was the ringleader of nothing; he never took part in planning for the 9/11 attacks. He was brutally mistreated and, in another kind of world, would be exhibit one in the war crimes trials of Americaâs top leaders and its major intelligence agency.		
Yet notorious as he once was, heâs been forgotten by all but his lawyers and a few tenacious reporters. He shouldnât have been. He was the test case for the kind of torture that Donald Trump now wants the US. government to bring back, presumably because it âworkedâ so well the first time. With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

Experiments in Torture
In August 2002, a group of FBI agents, CIA agents, and Pakistani forces captured Zubaydah (along with about 50 other men) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up. The Agencyâs interest in his health was, however, anything but humanitarian. Its officials wanted to interrogate him and, even after he had recovered sufficiently to be questioned, his captors occasionally withheld pain medication as a means of torture.		
When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.

There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.

And even if it had been true, what the CIA did to Abu Zubaydahâwith the knowledge and approval of the highest government officialsâis a prime example of the kind of still-unpunished crimes that officials like Dick Cheney, George Bush, and Donald Rumsfeld committed in the so-called Global War on Terror.		
So who was this infamous figure, and where is he now? His name is Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, but he is better known by his Arabic nickname, Abu Zubaydah. And as far as we know, he is still in solitary detention in GuantÃ¡namo.		
A Saudi national, in the 1980s Zubaydah helped run the Khaldan camp, a mujahedeen training facility set up in Afghanistan with CIA help during the Soviet occupation of that country. In other words, Zubaydah was then an American ally in the fight against the Soviets, one of President Ronald Reaganâs âfreedom fighters.â (But then again, so in effect was Osama bin Laden.)

Zubaydahâs later fate in the hands of the CIA was of a far grimmer nature. He had the dubious luck to be the subject of a number of CIA âfirstsâ: the first postâ9/11 prisoner to be waterboarded; the first to be experimented on by psychologists working as CIA contractors; one of the first of the Agencyâs âghost prisonersâ (detainees hidden from the world, including the International Committee of the Red Cross which, under the Geneva Conventions, must be allowed access to every prisoner of war); and one of the first prisoners to be cited in a memo written by Jay Bybee for the Bush administration on what the CIA could âlegallyâ do to a detainee without supposedly violating US federal laws against torture.		
Zubaydahâs story isâor at least should beâthe iconic tale of the illegal extremes to which the Bush administration and the CIA went in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. And yet former officials, from CIA head Michael Hayden to Vice President Dick Cheney to George W. Bush himself, have presented it as a glowing example of the use of âenhanced interrogation techniquesâ to extract desperately needed information from the âevildoersâ of that time.		
Zubaydah was an early experiment in postâ9/11 CIA practices and hereâs the remarkable thing (though it has yet to become part of the mainstream media accounts of his case): it was all a big lie. Zubaydah wasnât involved with Al Qaeda; he was the ringleader of nothing; he never took part in planning for the 9/11 attacks. He was brutally mistreated and, in another kind of world, would be exhibit one in the war crimes trials of Americaâs top leaders and its major intelligence agency.		
Yet notorious as he once was, heâs been forgotten by all but his lawyers and a few tenacious reporters. He shouldnât have been. He was the test case for the kind of torture that Donald Trump now wants the US. government to bring back, presumably because it âworkedâ so well the first time. With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

Experiments in Torture
In August 2002, a group of FBI agents, CIA agents, and Pakistani forces captured Zubaydah (along with about 50 other men) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up. The Agencyâs interest in his health was, however, anything but humanitarian. Its officials wanted to interrogate him and, even after he had recovered sufficiently to be questioned, his captors occasionally withheld pain medication as a means of torture.		
When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping.

A Saudi national, in the 1980s Zubaydah helped run the Khaldan camp, a mujahedeen training facility set up in Afghanistan with CIA help during the Soviet occupation of that country. In other words, Zubaydah was then an American ally in the fight against the Soviets, one of President Ronald Reaganâs âfreedom fighters.â (But then again, so in effect was Osama bin Laden.)

Zubaydahâs later fate in the hands of the CIA was of a far grimmer nature. He had the dubious luck to be the subject of a number of CIA âfirstsâ: the first postâ9/11 prisoner to be waterboarded; the first to be experimented on by psychologists working as CIA contractors; one of the first of the Agencyâs âghost prisonersâ (detainees hidden from the world, including the International Committee of the Red Cross which, under the Geneva Conventions, must be allowed access to every prisoner of war); and one of the first prisoners to be cited in a memo written by Jay Bybee for the Bush administration on what the CIA could âlegallyâ do to a detainee without supposedly violating US federal laws against torture.		
Zubaydahâs story isâor at least should beâthe iconic tale of the illegal extremes to which the Bush administration and the CIA went in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. And yet former officials, from CIA head Michael Hayden to Vice President Dick Cheney to George W. Bush himself, have presented it as a glowing example of the use of âenhanced interrogation techniquesâ to extract desperately needed information from the âevildoersâ of that time.		
Zubaydah was an early experiment in postâ9/11 CIA practices and hereâs the remarkable thing (though it has yet to become part of the mainstream media accounts of his case): it was all a big lie. Zubaydah wasnât involved with Al Qaeda; he was the ringleader of nothing; he never took part in planning for the 9/11 attacks. He was brutally mistreated and, in another kind of world, would be exhibit one in the war crimes trials of Americaâs top leaders and its major intelligence agency.		
Yet notorious as he once was, heâs been forgotten by all but his lawyers and a few tenacious reporters. He shouldnât have been. He was the test case for the kind of torture that Donald Trump now wants the US. government to bring back, presumably because it âworkedâ so well the first time. With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

Experiments in Torture
In August 2002, a group of FBI agents, CIA agents, and Pakistani forces captured Zubaydah (along with about 50 other men) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up. The Agencyâs interest in his health was, however, anything but humanitarian. Its officials wanted to interrogate him and, even after he had recovered sufficiently to be questioned, his captors occasionally withheld pain medication as a means of torture.		
When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

A Saudi national, in the 1980s Zubaydah helped run the Khaldan camp, a mujahedeen training facility set up in Afghanistan with CIA help during the Soviet occupation of that country. In other words, Zubaydah was then an American ally in the fight against the Soviets, one of President Ronald Reaganâs âfreedom fighters.â (But then again, so in effect was Osama bin Laden.)

Zubaydahâs later fate in the hands of the CIA was of a far grimmer nature. He had the dubious luck to be the subject of a number of CIA âfirstsâ: the first postâ9/11 prisoner to be waterboarded; the first to be experimented on by psychologists working as CIA contractors; one of the first of the Agencyâs âghost prisonersâ (detainees hidden from the world, including the International Committee of the Red Cross which, under the Geneva Conventions, must be allowed access to every prisoner of war); and one of the first prisoners to be cited in a memo written by Jay Bybee for the Bush administration on what the CIA could âlegallyâ do to a detainee without supposedly violating US federal laws against torture.

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â

In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping.

It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:

Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.

Zubaydahâs later fate in the hands of the CIA was of a far grimmer nature. He had the dubious luck to be the subject of a number of CIA âfirstsâ: the first postâ9/11 prisoner to be waterboarded; the first to be experimented on by psychologists working as CIA contractors; one of the first of the Agencyâs âghost prisonersâ (detainees hidden from the world, including the International Committee of the Red Cross which, under the Geneva Conventions, must be allowed access to every prisoner of war); and one of the first prisoners to be cited in a memo written by Jay Bybee for the Bush administration on what the CIA could âlegallyâ do to a detainee without supposedly violating US federal laws against torture.		
Zubaydahâs story isâor at least should beâthe iconic tale of the illegal extremes to which the Bush administration and the CIA went in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. And yet former officials, from CIA head Michael Hayden to Vice President Dick Cheney to George W. Bush himself, have presented it as a glowing example of the use of âenhanced interrogation techniquesâ to extract desperately needed information from the âevildoersâ of that time.		
Zubaydah was an early experiment in postâ9/11 CIA practices and hereâs the remarkable thing (though it has yet to become part of the mainstream media accounts of his case): it was all a big lie. Zubaydah wasnât involved with Al Qaeda; he was the ringleader of nothing; he never took part in planning for the 9/11 attacks. He was brutally mistreated and, in another kind of world, would be exhibit one in the war crimes trials of Americaâs top leaders and its major intelligence agency.		
Yet notorious as he once was, heâs been forgotten by all but his lawyers and a few tenacious reporters. He shouldnât have been. He was the test case for the kind of torture that Donald Trump now wants the US. government to bring back, presumably because it âworkedâ so well the first time. With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

Experiments in Torture
In August 2002, a group of FBI agents, CIA agents, and Pakistani forces captured Zubaydah (along with about 50 other men) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up. The Agencyâs interest in his health was, however, anything but humanitarian. Its officials wanted to interrogate him and, even after he had recovered sufficiently to be questioned, his captors occasionally withheld pain medication as a means of torture.		
When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

Zubaydahâs story isâor at least should beâthe iconic tale of the illegal extremes to which the Bush administration and the CIA went in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. And yet former officials, from CIA head Michael Hayden to Vice President Dick Cheney to George W.

With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up.

The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

Zubaydah was an early experiment in postâ9/11 CIA practices and hereâs the remarkable thing (though it has yet to become part of the mainstream media accounts of his case): it was all a big lie. Zubaydah wasnât involved with Al Qaeda; he was the ringleader of nothing; he never took part in planning for the 9/11 attacks. He was brutally mistreated and, in another kind of world, would be exhibit one in the war crimes trials of Americaâs top leaders and its major intelligence agency.		
Yet notorious as he once was, heâs been forgotten by all but his lawyers and a few tenacious reporters. He shouldnât have been. He was the test case for the kind of torture that Donald Trump now wants the US. government to bring back, presumably because it âworkedâ so well the first time. With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

Experiments in Torture
In August 2002, a group of FBI agents, CIA agents, and Pakistani forces captured Zubaydah (along with about 50 other men) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up. The Agencyâs interest in his health was, however, anything but humanitarian. Its officials wanted to interrogate him and, even after he had recovered sufficiently to be questioned, his captors occasionally withheld pain medication as a means of torture.		
When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

Yet notorious as he once was, heâs been forgotten by all but his lawyers and a few tenacious reporters. He shouldnât have been. He was the test case for the kind of torture that Donald Trump now wants the US. government to bring back, presumably because it âworkedâ so well the first time. With Republican presidential hopefuls promising future war crimes, itâs worth reconsidering his case and thinking about how to prevent it from happening again. After all, itâs only because no one has been held to account for the years of Bush administration torture practices that Trump and others feel free to promise even more and âyugerâ war crimes in the future.

Experiments in Torture
In August 2002, a group of FBI agents, CIA agents, and Pakistani forces captured Zubaydah (along with about 50 other men) in Faisalabad, Pakistan. In the process, he was severely injuredâshot in the thigh, testicle, and stomach. He might well have died, had the CIA not flown in an American surgeon to patch him up. The Agencyâs interest in his health was, however, anything but humanitarian. Its officials wanted to interrogate him and, even after he had recovered sufficiently to be questioned, his captors occasionally withheld pain medication as a means of torture.		
When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.

Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

When he âlostâ his left eye under mysterious circumstances while in CIA custody, the agencyâs concern again was not for his health. The December 2014 torture report produced by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (despite CIA opposition that included hacking into the committeeâs computers) described the situation this way: with his left eye gone, â[i]n October 2002, DETENTION SITE GREEN [now known to be Thailand] recommended that the vision in his right eye be tested, noting that â[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read, and write.â DETENTION SITE GREEN stressed that âthis request is driven by our intelligence needs [not] humanitarian concern for AZ.ââ		
The CIA then set to work interrogating Zubaydah with the help of two contractors, the psychologists Bruce Jessen and James Mitchell. Zubaydah would be the first human subject on whom those two, who were former instructors at the Air Forceâs SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training center, could test their theories about using torture to induce what they called âlearned helplessness,â meant to reduce a suspectâs resistance to interrogation. Their price? Only $81 million.		
CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan).

In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

CIA records show that, using a plan drawn up by Jessen and Mitchell, Abu Zubaydahâs interrogators would waterboard him an almost unimaginable 83 times in the course of a single month; that is, they would strap him to a wooden board, place a cloth over his entire face, and gradually pour water through the cloth until he began to drown. At one point during this endlessly repeated ordeal, the Senate committee reported that Zubaydah became âcompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.â

Each of those 83 uses of what was called âthe watering cycleâ consisted of four steps:		
â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan).

And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

â1) demands for information interspersed with the application of the water just short of blocking his airway 2) escalation of the amount of water applied until it blocked his airway and he started to have involuntary spasms 3) raising the water-board to clear subjectâs airway 4) lowering of the water-board and return to demands for information.â		
The CIA videotaped Zubaydah undergoing each of these âcycles,â only to destroy those tapes in 2005 when news of their existence surfaced and the embarrassment (and possible future culpability) of the Agency seemed increasingly to be at stake. CIA Director Michael Hayden would later assure CNN that the tapes had been destroyed only because âthey no longer had âintelligence valueâ and they posed a security risk.â Whose âsecurityâ was at risk if the tapes became public? Most likely, that of the Agencyâs operatives and contractors who were breaking multiple national and international laws against torture, along with the high CIA and Bush administration officials who had directly approved their actions.		
In addition to the waterboarding, the Senate torture report indicates that Zubaydah endured excruciating stress positions (which cause terrible pain without leaving a mark); sleep deprivation (for up to 180 hours, which generally induces hallucinations or psychosis); unrelenting exposure to loud noises (another psychosis-inducer); âwallingâ (the Agencyâs term for repeatedly slamming the shoulder blades into a âflexible, false wall,â though Zubaydah told the International Committee of the Red Cross that when this was first done to him, âhe was slammed directly against a hard concrete wallâ); and confinement for hours in a box so cramped that he could not stand up inside it. All of these methods of torture had been given explicit approval in a memo written to the CIAâs head lawyer, John Rizzo, by Jay Bybee, who was then serving in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel. In thatmemo Bybee approved the use of 10 different âtechniquesâ on Zubaydah.

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place.

In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

It seems likely that, while the CIA was torturing Zubaydah at Jessenâs and Mitchellâs direction for whatever information he might have, it was also using him to test the âeffectivenessâ of waterboarding as a torture technique. If so, the agency and its contractors violated not only international law, but the US War Crimes Act, which expressly forbids experimenting on prisoners.		
What might lead us to think that Zubaydahâs treatment was, in part, an experiment? In a May 30, 2005, memo sent to Rizzo, Steven Bradbury, head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, discussed the CIAâs record keeping. There was, Bradbury commented, method to the CIAâs brutality. âCareful records are kept of each interrogation,â he wrote. This procedure, he continued, âallows for ongoing evaluation of the efficacy of each technique and its potential for any unintended or inappropriate results.â In other words, with the support of the Bush Justice Department, the CIA was keeping careful records of an experimental procedure designed to evaluate how well waterboarding worked.		
This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â

According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

This was Abu Zubaydahâs impression as well. âI was told during this period that I was one of the first to receive these interrogation techniques,â Zubaydah would later tell the International Committee of the Red Cross, âso no rules applied. It felt like they were experimenting and trying out techniques to be used later on other people.â		
In addition to the videotaping, the CIAâs Office of Medical Services required a meticulous written record of every waterboarding session. The details to be recorded were spelled out clearly:		
âIn order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.â		
Again, these were clearly meant to be the records of an experimental procedure, focusing as they did on how much water was effective; whether a âsealâ was achieved (so no air could enter the victimâs lungs); whether the naso- or oropharynx (that is, the nose and throat) were so full of water the victim could not breathe; and just how much the âsubjectâ vomited up.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.

It was with Zubaydah that the CIA also began its postâ9/11 practice of hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross by transferring them to its âblack sites,â the secret prisons it was setting up in countries with complacent or complicit regimes around the world. Such unacknowledged detainees came to be known as âghost prisoners,â because they had no official existence. As the Senate torture report noted, âIn part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a US military base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a facility in Country _______ [now known to have been Thailand].â		
Tortured and Circular Reasoning
As British investigative journalist Andy Worthington in 2009, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs âinterrogationâ results to help justify the greatest crime of that administration, the unprovoked, illegal invasion of Iraq. Officials leaked to the media that he had confessed to knowing about a secret agreement involving Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who later led Al Qaeda in Iraq), and Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein to work together âto destabilize the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.â Of course, it was all lies. Zubaydah couldnât have known about such an arrangement, first because it was, as Worthington says, âabsurd,â and second, because Zubaydah was not a member of Al Qaeda at all.		
In fact, the evidence that Zubaydah had anything to do with Al Qaeda was beyond circumstantialâit was entirely circular. The administrationâs reasoning went something like this: Zubaydah, a âsenior al-Qaeda lieutenant,â ran the Khaldan camp in Afghanistan; therefore, Khaldan was an Al Qaeda camp; if Khaldan was an al Qaeda camp, then Zubaydah must have been a senior al Qaeda official.		
They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

									});
								
The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.		
The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.

The capture, torture, and propaganda use of Abu Zubaydah is the perfect example of the US governmentâs unique combination of willful law-breaking, ass-covering memo-writing, and what some Salvadorans I once worked with called âstrategic incompetence.â The fact that no oneânot George Bush or Dick Cheney, not Jessen or Mitchell, nor multiple directors of the CIAâhas been held accountable means that, unless we are very lucky, we will see more of the same in the future.		
		

They then used their âenhanced techniquesâ to drag what they wanted to hear out of a man whose life bore no relation to the tortured lies he evidently finally told his captors. Not surprisingly, no aspect of the administrationâs formula proved accurate. It was true that, for several years, the Bush administration routinely referred to Khaldan as an Al Qaeda training camp, but the CIA was well aware that this wasnât so.		
The Senate Intelligence Committeeâs torture report, for instance, made this crystal clear, quoting an August 16, 2006, CIA Intelligence Assessment, âCountering Misconceptions About Training Camps in Afghanistan, 1990-2001â this way:

Khaldan Not Affiliated With Al-Qaâida. A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-Qaâida. Pre-11 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a âsenior al-Qaâida lieutenant,â which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama bin Laden.		
Not only was Zubaydah not a senior Al Qaeda lieutenant, he had, according to the report, been turned down for membership in Al Qaeda as early as 1993 and the CIA knew it by at least 2006, if not far sooner. Nevertheless, the month after it privately clarified the nature of the Khaldan camp and Zubaydahâs lack of Al Qaeda connections, President Bush used the story of Zubaydahâs capture and interrogation in a speech to the nation justifying the CIAâs âenhanced interrogationâ program. He then claimed that Zubaydah had âhelped smuggle Al Qaida leaders out of Afghanistan.â		
In the same speech, Bush told the nation, âOur intelligence community believes [Zubaydah] had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trainedâ (a reference presumably to Khaldan). Perhaps the CIA should have been looking instead at some of the people who actually trained the hijackersâthe operators of flight schools in the United States, where, according to a September 23, 2001 Washington Post story, the FBI already knew âterroristsâ were learning to fly 747s.		
In June 2007, the Bush administration doubled down on its claim that Zubaydah was involved with 9/11. At a hearing before the congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger, discussing why the GuantÃ¡namo prison needed to remain open, explained that it âserves a very important purpose, to hold and detain individuals who are extremely dangerousâ¦[like] Abu Zubaydah, people who have been planners of 9/11.â		
Charges Withdrawn
In September 2009, the US government quietly withdrew its many allegations against Abu Zubaydah. His attorneys had filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf; that is, a petition to exercise the constitutional right of anyone in government custody to know on what charges they are being held. In that context, they were asking the government to supply certain documents to help substantiate their claim that his continued detention in GuantÃ¡namo was illegal. The new Obama administration replied with a 109-page brief filed in the US District Court in the District of Columbia, which is legally designated to hear the habeas cases of GuantÃ¡namo detainees.

The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.

The bulk of that brief came down to a government argument that was curious indeed, given the years of bragging about Zubaydahâs central role in Al Qaedaâs activities. It claimed that there was no reason to turn over any âexculpatoryâ documents demonstrating that he was not a member of Al Qaeda, or that he had no involvement in 9/11 or any other terrorist activityâbecause the government was no longer claiming that any of those things were true.		
The governmentâs lawyers went on to claim, bizarrely enough, that the Bush administration had never âcontended that [Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executingâ¦the attacks of September 11, 2001.â They added that âthe Government also has not contended in this proceeding that, at the time of his capture, [Zubaydah] had knowledge of any specific impending terrorist operationsââan especially curious claim, since the prevention of such future attacks was how the CIA justified its torture of Zubaydah in the first place. Far from believing that he was âif not the number two, very close to the number two person inâ Al Qaeda, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had once claimed, âthe Government has not contended in this proceeding that [Zubaydah] was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.â		
And so, the case against the man who was waterboarded 83 times and contributed supposedly crucial information to the CIA on Al Qaeda plotting was oh-so-quietly withdrawn without either fuss or media attention. Exhibit one was now exhibit none.		
Seven years after the initial filing of Zubaydahâs habeas petition, the DC District Court has yet to rule on it. Given the courtâs average 751-day turnaround time on such petitions, this is an extraordinary length of time. Here, justice delayed is truly justice denied.		
Perhaps we should not be surprised, however. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, CIA headquarters assured those who were interrogating Zubaydah that he would ânever be placed in a situation where he has any significant contact with others and/or has the opportunity to be released.â In fact, âall major players are in concurrence,â stated the agency, that he âshould remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.â And so far, thatâs exactly whatâs happened.

What the hell has happened to our country? Who hijacked America? We are consumed by fear. We see enemies everywhere. If they are the enemy, we apparently believe we can do whatever we want to them. I cannot think of any circumstance that would justify the torture of another human being. Certainly nothing this poor man did seems to justify his arrest, let alone his horrible abuse. Shame on us. We have become animals. When you treat Muslim people like this it only ramps up their hatred of America. It fuels the ranks of the terrorists. Bush and that despicable cockroach,Cheney,need to rot in hell. Obama should be ashamed that he did not seek indictments for the animals who tortured this man and others. Worse yet studies show that torture is not a valid way to get truthful information. I cannot wait until I can retire to Costa Rica or Ecuador. When my feet hit their country, I will never set foot in this country again. We have become just as evil as the terrorists we hate. Trump advocates more torture and the mobs cheer him. May God forgive the United States. Secret courts, secret warrants and ghost prisoners-- oh my God

I never expected the Cheney-Bush Administration would prosecute the torturers, but I expected the Obama Administration would. But I was wrong. I certainly would not expect a Clinton Administration to do so. And if we&apos;re so unfortunate as to have Mrs. Clinton as President, I&apos;m sure my prediction will be correct. Two out of three isn&apos;t so bad, is it?

Did anyone involved have a conscience?

Do those on the political right, who support the use of torture, ever consider that, under a dictatorial leftist government, such as they imagine the Obama adminins5ration to be, it could be themselves  strapped to a board ?

I appreciate this article, but I hate the title because it suggests (unintentionally I&apos;m sure) that there&apos;s a "right" man to torture. No such man exists.

Thank you of this important, albeit painful, article. How do these guys - or any of us - sleep at night knowing of these injustices?

And this from a nation that espouses high moral and legal values and chastises other nations for their human rights violations. The current administration also has a large responsibility for its drone strikes and the murder of civilians in large portions of the Middle East.

These kinds of actions and deceit ought to be a crime.  Oh wait, they are!  Would that someone with the appropriate authority would at least attempt to enforce action against this heinous criminality.

Unfortunately, in this country, whether one is charged and prosecuted is a function of one&apos;s status and VIP connections.

Yet another unfiled charge to leave at the office of Dick Cheney&apos;s defense lawyers.

One cannot work for an organization like the CIA and not be complicit in its crimes. As President Harry S. Truman  stated "I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American Gestapo." How right he was.

This was difficult to read. Zubaydah&apos;s treatment was just sadistic.

If that doesn&apos;t make you ashamed to be an American what would?

Agreed 1000%.  I am sickened by the fact that this poor man has been abused and destroyed as he has been and that not one of the US officials responsible have been prosecuted.  Our moral authority is GONE.
Absolutely disgusting, OUTRAGEOUS, and infuriating.
