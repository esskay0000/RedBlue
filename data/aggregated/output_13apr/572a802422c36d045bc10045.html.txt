Erick Erickson â the influential conservative blogger and radio host who founded the right-wing website RedState â slammed his party on Wednesday for backing Donald Trump.

In a post on his personal blog The Resurgent, Erickson, who has been an outspoken member of the Never Trump movement, questioned the morals of the GOP.

Ericksonâs post begins by pointing to the 1990 Senate run of Louisiana Republican David Duke (a white supremacist and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan). Duke ran as a Republican, but the party opposed him. Now with Trump's nomination, Erickson asked, where is the party?



âTrump is vocally supported by white supremacists, white nationalists, and racial grievance mongers. He plays to them openly. Trump attacked the wife of a political opponent and that political opponentâs father. He drummed up internet conspiracy theories.

"Trump has mistreated those who have done work for him. He is being sued for fraud because of Trump University. He has openly joked about having sex with his daughter. Heâs bragged about his affairs.

"Why can we not draw a line here? Why canât the GOP say this is unacceptable. It is, after all, apparent that much of Trumpâs support comes from outside the GOP with people who came into the party to support Trump, but otherwise have no use for the party. It is apparent that Trump is using the party as a personal vehicle without a commitment to the party otherwise."

Erickson then brings up the impeachment hearings of former president Bill Clinton and says that if his party is going to nominate Trump, they owe Clinton an apology.

âTwenty years ago Republicans supported impeaching the President of the United States for lying under oath in office and having an affair in the Oval Office,â Erickson writes. âNow that same party is on the verge of nominating a serial philanderer and pathological liar. At the very least the GOP owes Bill Clinton an apology.â

Erickson also slammed some Republicans who, after criticizing Trump earlier in the cycle have, now said theyâd support the real estate mogul, âshame on them.â

âSome Republicans may decide it is time to be a team player, but I will put my country before my party and decline to help the voters in this country commit national suicide,â Erickson finished. âFor those who lament the loss of the Supreme Court with Hillary Clintonâs now inevitable re-election, I would counter that it is obvious the United States now has far bigger problems than judges.â

âThat bigger problem begins with Republicans now losing any sense of shame and surrendering to their lesser angels in the name of unity around a man unfit for Presidency. As Charles Spurgeon said, 'Of two evils, choose neither,' â he continued.
