Marco Rubio inched closer to backingÂ Ted Cruz for the GOP presidential nomination on Tuesday, in what was almost an endorsement by process of elimination.

Why Cruz? Not because the Texas senator is the best conservative in the race, Rubio said, but because he's the only one.

Rubio made the remarks during an appearanceÂ on conservative commentator Mark Levin's video podcast.

"I hope that theyâll nominate a conservative," Rubio said, perÂ ABC News.Â "The only one (presidential candidate)Â that fits that criteria is Ted Cruz.â

Rubio's quasi-endorsement doesn't mean he's out of the race. Not technically, anyway.

Last month, the Florida senator hatched an unprecedented plan to hold onto the 172 Republican delegates earned during his presidential run, effectively keeping them from front-runner Donald Trump in a bid to hinder Trump's path to the nomination.

Trump, however, recently floated Rubio as a possible VPÂ pick, a thought Rubio dismissed.

âIâm not going to be the vice president," he said.
