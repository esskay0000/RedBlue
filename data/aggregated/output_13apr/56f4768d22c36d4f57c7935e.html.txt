AÂ poll out WednesdayÂ from Quinnipiac University shows that while Republican John Kasich and Democratic candidateÂ Bernie Sanders trail in their respective primary races, each would fare best for his party in theÂ general election.

While Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump continued to cement their status as their parties' front-runnersÂ in the poll, they didnât fare as well in a hypothetical November matchup among all American voters as did Kasich and Sanders.

While Clinton edged out Trump in a head-to-head matchup by six percentage points, Sanders beat Trump by a whopping 14.

Likewise, Kasich topped Clinton by eightÂ percentage points in a hypotheticalÂ general election matchup.

If, against all odds (and math?), both partiesâ underdogs win nominations, the poll showed Kasich barely edging out Sanders, 45% to 44%.

Meanwhile, anotherÂ poll released today showed just over half of Republicans believe their party should get behind Trump this summer if the GOP hasÂ a contested convention.
