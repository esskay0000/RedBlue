Bernie Sanders and his supporters are uniquely positioned to advance a political revolution by doing the thing many Democrats wonât do: throwing down, in a real way, with people of color.Â Although for reasons relating to strategy, familiarity, and message, voters of color across the country chose Hillary Clinton over Sanders, much of the Democratic Party establishment has yet to reciprocate that loyalty in meaningful ways. Many Democratic leaders pay a lot of lip service to people of color, but the revenues rarely match the rhetoric. If Sanders focuses the forces and resources heâs accumulated in his historic campaign on supporting progressive leaders and organizations of color, he could upend progressive politics and significantly strengthen the cause of combating income and wealth inequality in America.

In perhaps one of historyâs greater moments of poetic justice, the socialist candidate battling the billionaires actually has a formidable money machine that is unprecedented in progressive politics. To date, Sanders has raised $186 million dollars: 65 percent from âsmall donationsâ under $200 each, orâas Sanders loves to sayâabout $27 on average per donation. What he does with that machine could be revolutionary on a scale perhaps not ever seen before in US politics.		
While much of the conversation about wealth inequality focuses on trends of the past 30 years, the roots of inequality in America stretch back more than 400 years to the arrival of the first English settlers on this continent. From the violent theft of land from indigenous inhabitants, to the creation of wealth by enslaved black bodies in chains, to the widespread and legal practice of racial discrimination in employment, hiring, lending, and housing up until 1964, economic inequity has gone hand in hand with racial discrimination and exploitation. Because of the connection between racial and economic exploitation, the struggles of people of color for equality have driven many of the most powerful periods of change in US history.		
From participating in civil-rights struggles in the 1960s to being one of the few white politicians in America to endorse Jesse Jacksonâs 1988 presidential bid, Bernie has been on the right side of history. Those who marched, sacrificed, and fought for civil rights and voting rights in the 1960s created the conditions for the passage of the Voting Rights Act and Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which opened the doors of civic participation and citizenship to tens of millions of people of color. That demographic revolution made it possible to elect and reelect a black man as president of a country that formerly held black folks in human bondage.		
In 2012, people of color accounted for fully 46 percent of Democratic voters, yet the modern Democratic Party is appallingly slow to properly embrace and invest in the fastest-growing parts of the US population. This year, top party leaders abandoned or, worse, outright blocked progressive champions of color, such as Donna Edwards in her bid for the Maryland Senate seat and Lucy Flores in her Nevada congressional campaign. While some parts of the party infrastructure have taken positive steps in hiring people of color, the racial composition of those in the highest positions of leadership is not just striking, itâs evocative of apartheid South Africa where the people-of-color majority was restricted to lower-level jobs, while the positions of power were almost exclusively reserved for whites.

Sanders has already started to show whatâs possible by marrying his movement with the moment of the browning of America. In Las Vegas, progressive Latina Lucy Flores grew up poor, ran with gangs in her teenage years, and was incarcerated at a young age before going on to become a lawyer and state legislator. Flores is running against a wealthy white woman who, up until April, had managed to significantly out-fundraise her. But then along came Bernie. Sandersâs campaign sent out a fundraising appeal on Floresâs behalf, and more than 32,000 donors responded, filling her coffers with more than $428,000 and instantly transforming the race. If she wins, which is now eminently possible, Flores will be one of the most progressive national Latina elected officials in the country.		
Backing individual candidates of color like Flores could just be the beginning. One of the most significant legacies of Jesse Jacksonâs 1980s presidential campaigns is that they catalyzed the careers of warriors for justice such as Congresswomen Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters who have championed justice and equality for the past quarter century. Sandersâs support of Flores; Washington State Senator Pramila Jayapal, an Indian-American activist; and progressive New York activist Zephyr Teachout may also yield similarly promising results. And, looking ahead, his national surrogate Nina Turner, an African-American former state senator in Ohio, is poised to become the next mayor of Cleveland in 2017.

Elevating the right candidates into elected office is only part of the battle. Ultimately, the entire Democratic Party needs to be transformed. The only Democratic National Committee Chairperson of color in history has been Ron Brown, an African-American who came out of Jesse Jacksonâs 1988 campaign. After Howard Deanâs inspiring 2004 candidacy, Dean took control of the Democratic Party, appointing people of color to the very top leadership posts, and implementing the 50-state strategy. The Sanders movement can and should focus on pushing the party back towards the people by insisting on the hiring and promotion of leaders of color and a massive financial commitment to grassroots organizing and infrastructure, especially in the growing communities of color that make up nearly half of Democratic voters.		
Approaching the end of the Obama era, the Democratic Party is at a crossroads. The Sanders campaign has already made history, and going forward, by doing what too many Democrats wonât, Sanders is poised to make a mark that lasts long beyond 2016, fosters truly revolutionary change, and moves the country closer to income and wealth equality.

I have confidence that Sanders can and will work to support and promote Progressive candidates, regardless of color or creed.  I also hope that he will work to oust corporatist Democrats who are many more parts problem than solution.  He could start with the members of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC.

Maybe I read to many blogs. There seems to be an assumption that the voting public is evenly divided between DEM and REP. Actually, the largest voting block is IND. The IND folks do not feel particularly drawn to either party. The presumption that an HRC loss is to be blamed on Bernie supporters is BS. An HRC loss is to be blamed on HRC. If she can convince enough voters (DEM, REP or IND) to support her, she will win. Otherwise, someone else will.

"Although for reasons relating to strategy, familiarity, and message, voters of color across the country chose Hillary Clinton over Sanders" How about antisemitism? Not to say that there isn&apos;t merit to your argument, but the African American religious community has to take stock of its own prejudices.

JOHN,  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS OVER. 
THIS IS ACTUALLY TURNING OUT TO BE A REAL REVOLUTION BUT YOU ARE BLIND!  
THIS IS THE PEOPLES MOVEMENT AND THIS IS THE PEOPLE PARTY. BYE DEMS, REVOLUTION!

John you are a sell out. The counting of the vote is being done out of public view inside computarized tabulators that have the capacity to fractionalize the vote.  In other words, voter&apos;s votes can be weighted differently the actual exit polls show the vote count to be fraudulent in all the primaries in this race.  The reported vote count always takes from Sanders and adds to Clinton.  The race is being stolen and even the nation just looks at the supression issues which is the distracation from the worse crime- the stealing of the vote in the counting .  It is an evil magic trip. 
WAKE UP JOHN AND DO SOME INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING!!!

As an aside, I am wondering if anyone can substantiate the rumor that Sen. Schumer has interfered with Bernie&apos;s supporting otherwise acceptable Demo candidates in Maryland, PA and Ohio -- or risk losing his chairman (either minority of majority) position on the committee.... "Before It&apos;s News" published this, but...
Worrisome, that.

aures lupi

Schumer should be understood as a dedicated supporter of the corrupt, unproductive parasitic financial industry, just like Obama and the Clintons.   Or Barney Frank, who the TV cable news networks love because he pretends to back Wall St "reform".

Lessening income inequality is a by-product of a healthy society.  A tax code that enforces re-investment in society, from science to the arts, will sensitize the population to the necessity of  diverting the country away from excessive, and largely blind, consumerism and toward a more informed, if not enlightened view of what the Earth needs, rather than  what more and more humans raised on television think they need.  Income inequality creates intellectual and scientific inequality because society is unwittingly enforcing its own retardation - denying those who would further humanity&apos;s progress to being left on the side of the road of history.  True progress takes a lot of heavy lifting.  A few white guys at the top doesn&apos;t cut it - and never will.

While I agree with some of what the author says, I think he isn&apos;t seeing clear as to why the coloreds went for Hillary rather than their own better good with Bernie Sanders: CORRUPTION. Most of the black leaders supported Hillary because that will result in benefits for themselves and their buddies. That wouldn&apos;t likely happen with Bernie Sanders. Even though Sanders supported the BLM wholeheartedly, the BLM did not support Sanders likewise. To think that Sanders should now use the money collected to further the blacks/coloreds exclusively is therefore asking for too much. There is no such thing as altruism. If at the end of Sanders&apos; run for the presidency he has any money left over, I&apos;m sure he will use it to further all of the poor by supporting worthy leaders for political office independent of color and by fighting for better schools in deprived neighborhoods no matter what their color is. By fighting for humane working conditions for all and all the issues he was talking about in his speeches. He has been fighting for that all his life. Unfortunately, as happens time and again, the truer candidate was pushed under by the money machine - in this case the Clinton machine. For an interesting analysis as to how that machine works, see Pepe Escobar&apos;s article in Counterpunch.

What the average voter appears not to have understood is that the Obama-Clinton continuum favors a war based economy that creates jobs via military industrial sector, pharmaceutical/medical and banking industries - the principal benefactors of perpetual war. Both Bernie Sanders and Trump advocate an end to war and a peace based economy, creating jobs by rebuilding the infrastructure, increased investment in public education and the private, capitalist sector - that is, the regular companies that do business in the US but that do not write the policies in Washington. Unfortunately neither candidate so far brought out that Hillary&apos;s insistence on ousting Qaddafi and destabilizing Syria is precisely a move to keep the war on terror going endlessly - i.e. perpetual war to keep the status quo of the .01% who have all the wealth vs. the 99% who don&apos;t.  Further information from the conservative NGO Judicial Watch shows that Mexican drug cartels work together with ISIS affiliated fighters to bring them into the US to scout out places where to launch an attack inside the US. Such attacks can of course be prevented. It has been going on for years. But it is also clear that whenever the administration wants further concessions of privacy to spy on US citizens, there will either be a real or near miss ISIS attack inside the US: to keep the fear and therefore the justification for total surveillance going. That is what people vote for with Hillary. Trump and Bernie stood up against it and have the US MSM completely against them. CNN, WaPo and NYT have already started the same slanderous reporting on Trump with which they denigrated and discredited Bernie Sanders.

To get more blacks into leadership positions isn&apos;t the answer anymore. What is required is a dismantling of the entire current leadership establishment, independent of color, race etc. In the end, the positions have to be filled by who is best qualified for them where qualification means: moral ethics to keep America genuinely democratic.

Brigitte, your comment makes a lot of good points, but you employ the antiquated term: "the coloreds," which is reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. Although it seems like a minor point, "persons of color" is the correct term. Also, you presume that P.O.C.s "went for Hillary rather than their own better good with Bernie Sanders." Who are we to know what motivates people to vote? What is "their" own better good? I would suggest that this particular judgment could be offensive to many people.

The use of the term "coloreds" indicates her  and many others patronizing attitude that the "coloreds" have no agency and thus lack the sophistication to vote for their chosen candidate.  I voted for my candidate of choice not only because I want to see a female president but because in my estimation she is eminently qualified and would be best for her "colored"  and other constituents. Any progressive movement in this country that cannot or doesn&apos;t try hard enough to attract the African-American, Latino, Asian etc. vote is doomed to electoral failure.

Progressives need to continue fighting for the economic interests of EVERYONE on Main St., given that neoliberal Party leaders and insiders have become neoliberals:  socially moderate and aligned with Wall St. and major corporations economically.

This article spells out how progressives can transform the democratic party and build a lasting coalition with African Americans that moves beyond photo ops in black churches and empty rhetoric during election cycles for the expressed purpose of maintaining the status quo.  Progressives can build a coalition that supports African American candidates and encourages them to seek office to advocate progressive policies that benefit their communities.

Are you kidding?  Then we&apos;ll be told we&apos;re ignorant, whitesplaining, and patronizing.  They&apos;ve made their choice and they should be able to expect to influence Hillary in return.

And rightly so

If Bernie truly wants to lead a revolution, he should budget $25 million of the $186 million he&apos;s raised equally among 25 progressive candidates for the Senate and 25 progressive challengers in the House.  This would show true leadership.

Are you kidding me?  Minorities just snubbed progressivism to support 4 more years of neoliberal global militarism from Madame Secretary Establishment.  Minority leadership and organizations have forfeited all claims to a progressive agenda.  All slights, problems, complaints, and alleged outrages should henceforth be referred to Queen Hillary.

And this has nothing to do with Bernie&apos;s failure to attract the "minorities" Mr. member of the majority?

Don&apos;t be discouraged. Sanders is going to win this thing yet: http://hireme.wordwhisperer.net/2016/04/29/stillsanders-heres-itll-happen-john-laurits/

http://hireme.wordwhisperer.net/2016/04/29/stillsanders-heres-itll-happen-john-laurits/

While I don&apos;t consider myself a progressive, I am very glad Bernie is in this campaign - and glad he&apos;s doing better than most would have guessed when he first announced.  I&apos;m pleased he brought single-payer health insurance back in to the national discussion and I hope voters recognize his overall integrity - especially compared to the Clinton and Trump.

While supporting a national single payer system we should also support state level single payer movements like ColoradoCare, http://coloradocareyes.co/ that could move the nation forward.

So, in your view, the mere reality, that Sanders supports impossible objectives should not concern us.  it&apos;s only that he talks to us a certain way; flatters us with his seeming agreement with our objectives, talks of sharing our values, should be enough for him to win the presidency.  The post just before mine, suggested that "The 2 party system does not and no longer represents the economic interests of the average citizen."  This is delusional.  How, then, is Hillary so far ahead of Sanders, at every level?  Your candidate has simply lost, which is the reason for your anger.  He has failed to convey the feeling that he&apos;ll represent most of the interests of the whole nation.  He can&apos;t win with his views.  You want to win the presidency, with views that are unacceptable to most American voters, at this time.  Am I pleased of his philosophy.  I certainly am, but he can&apos;t make his views prevail if he can&apos;t win the presidency, something he sought to do.  Your notion that he has moved her to the Left, is silly,  You can&apos;t rail against her ties to the "establishment," while suggesting that he moved her to the Left.   I continue to ask why he ran in a system he describes as corrupt, and which he himself tells us "buys its candidates" and insures their victory.  Why does he even now, seek support from super-delegates he claims are fundamentally corrupt?  How can he make a fuss about the influence of money in the political arena, and boast of raising more and spending more than she has?  Is he not attempting to buy his political way, in the public mind?  Hillary asks for inclusion.  Help her to achieve the goals we share.

Do you really think it is "delusional" to believe both parties represent global corporatism and oligarchy?
Maybe you are "projecting" your delusions onto others.

If you think that my comment about the 2 party system not representing the economic interests of the average citizen is "delusional", well then it is you that clearly has buried your head in the sand and it is you who doesn&apos;t want to see or believe what is crystal clear to millions of citizens who have donated to the only candidate in this race that truly stands with the 90 percent.  And I would suggest that you understand first where the D Party used to be...the views of Bernie Sanders is not fringe thinking...it was the mainstream views of the D Party during the 50s up to the late 80&apos;s before Al Fromm and Clinton came along.  It&apos;s just that the D party has moved so far to the center right since that time that you think Bernie Sanders "views" are extreme.

I wish I could get back the time wasted reading this rambling comment. A lot of words don&apos;t equate to making a strong case.

Like other commenters, I too support Bernie until the end of the primary season.     If Hillary wins I&apos;ll vote for her without hesitation.    The options on the GOP side are beyond consideration!

I will support Bernie Sanders and his message until I am no longer on this earth.  Either we remove the corporate Democrats from power (who have dominated the party for the last 25 years) and replace them with true progressives (now), or we must create a viable third party.  The 2 party system does not and no longer represents the economic interests of the average citizen.

Hear, hear! I will continue to support Bernie 2016 and the three candidates he has formally endorsed with as many $27 donations as I can muster. I also strongly support Tim Canova&apos;s campaign to oust Debbie Wasserman Schultz & hope that the Sanders campaign will add him to the list soon! Not me--US.

This is perhaps the best piece I have read about how to build on Sanders&apos; extraordinary candidacy, which we must build in in a very big way. Thank you.

To achieve life equality, which really must be the goal of humanity if we are to survive, we all must do what is necessary to raze the vertical economy. http://thelastwhy.ca/poems/2012/12/13/economy.html

Terrific article, but I still hope all this energy isn&apos;t going to be up against a Donald Trump Supreme Court and Donald Trump appointed regulatory commissions.  Of course that&apos;ll be up to the voters, with Sanders&apos; supporters among them.

This could happen. But, like you say, it will be up to the voters. Which means that, since Hillary has all but secured the nomination, Sanders supporters must show up at the polls to vote for her. Too many of them have the attitude of: "I&apos;ll take my ball and go home."
Despite the fact that Hillary is not the perfect candidate, she&apos;s not a Republican. Many, if not most, Sanders supporters say there&apos;s no difference between her and the Republicans. Please think about that.
She WILL nominate a liberal SC justice, among many other things.

Yes - keep on insulting Bernie supporters with comments like I&apos;ll take my ball and go home&apos;, that will really encourage them to vote for Clinton in the general. 
How about consider the fact that some Bernie supporters refuses to vote for Clinton because they will not compromise their values and vote for someone who takes huge sums of money from wall street, flip flops on social issues and supports neoliberal policies on economic issues, is dishonest and uses lies to attack Bernie Sanders, has the entire corrupt establishment media wrapped around her little finger, a military hawk with blood on her hands (please broaden your world view and consider her role in supporting military regimes around the world). 

I think what many of Bernie&apos;s supporters are simply saying to someone with Clinton&apos;s record is a clear and loud NO THANKS, and you should  consider the same.

"Lesser of 2 evils" has pushed the US steadily to the extreme right for 30 years.  Now we have the spectacle of the DEM Party nominating a  warmongering, neoliberal corporatist and calling her progressive.  No thanks!

If it is up against a Donald Trump Supreme Court and appointed regulatory commissions, democrats will only have themselves to blame.  Republican lite just will not cut it any more.

I felt a pang of guilt during this read, and the pain got worse afterwards in reflection. As a public defender lawyer for most of my 40+ year career, I have seen my share of prejudice in the criminal justice arena. But it all came home with this message -- and I realized that I was not in the lead at all, nor was I doing what should have been done years ago to level the playing field outside of that Colosseum. Felt like I paid my dues. 
No sir, I did not. I am blessed with good health, an adequate income in the sunsetting years, and think that what I contributed in the past was sufficient -- until Bernie came along.
God bless him. And I will remember his call. Every day. Looking for a chance to help someone worse off than I. Why? Because it&apos;s the right thing to do. Everything else is just transient rubbish.

Carry on, sir. You are an inspiration to worldly people who yearn for something bigger.
