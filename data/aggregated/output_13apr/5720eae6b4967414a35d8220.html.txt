On Friday, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, flanked by veteran civil-rights leaders, announced what he called a âlandmarkâ restoration of voting rights for convicted felons.

						});
					
The policy will immediately restore the right to voteâas well as the right to run for public office, serve on a jury or become a notary publicâto 206,000 Virginians who have served their time and completed their parole or probation, according to a press release.		
Virginia was one of only three states, along with Iowa and Florida, that permanently stripped felons of their right to vote. Virginia did have a process that allowed felons to apply to have their rights restored, but it was an onerous one. According to the the Sentencing Project, Virginia was also one of three states, along with Florida and Kentucky, where 20 percent or more of black adults are disenfranchised. Jeremy Haile, federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project, tells The Nation that Fridayâs move âis the most significant restoration of voting rights that we have ever seen. We see it as a model for other states.â
âWe have a horrible history here in Virginia,â McAuliffe told The Nation. âToday I announced this action on the steps of our capitol, where in 1901 and 1902 they put literacy tests, the poll tax and then disenfranchisement of felons into the stateâs constitution. We were one of the worst states in the United States of America on this issue. So we got rid of over 100 years of sad history denying people the right to vote in the Commonwealth of Virginia.â		
McAuliffe had already made some smaller moves to restore felons voting rights, reducing waiting times for violent felons to petition to have their rights restored, eliminating a requirement that individuals pay all of their court costs before theyâre eligible and reclassifying everyone convicted on drug charges as non-violent felons. âWe got 18,000 people back into the system,â says McAuliffe, âbut as I got into the issue, I wondered why these people had to go through this process. These people have served their time, theyâre done with their probation, theyâre back with their families and their communities, theyâre workingâwhy do we put these barriers around the voting box and make them jump through a bunch of hoops? If weâre giving people back their rights, then letâs just go ahead and do it.â		
The United States has around 5 percent of the worldâs population but houses around 25 percent of its prisoners. According to The Sentencing Project, almost six million Americans are prohibited from voting because of felony disenfranchisement laws. That represents around one out of every 40 voting-age adults. Nationwide, 75 percent of them have served their time and are out of prison.

While laws stripping felons of citizenship rights date back to ancient Rome, in the United States, theyâve been inextricably tied to racism and white supremacy. As Brent Staples reported for The New York Times, there was a massive expansion of these laws in the postâCivil War South, âwhen Southern lawmakers were working feverishly to neutralize the black electorate.â According to Staples, âPoll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and cross burnings were effective weapons in this campaign. But statutes that allowed correctional systems to arbitrarily and permanently strip large numbers of people of the right to vote were a particularly potent tool in the campaign to undercut African-American political power.â		
Prior to the launch of the War on Drugs in the 1980s, a majority of prisoners held in state and federal prisons were white, but a 2004 study by scholars at the University of Minnesota found that, between 1850 and 2002, âstates with larger proportions of nonwhites in their prison populations were more likely to pass [disenfranchisement]Â laws, even after statistically controlling for the effects of time, region, economic competition between whites and blacks, partisan control of government, and punitiveness.â
Today, 30 years after the drug war made people of color the majority in Americaâs prisons, African Americans are four times more likely to be stripped of their voting rights than the population as a whole, according to the Sentencing Project.		
The issue has gained greater attention in recent years, in part because of an increased focus on racial biases in the criminal justice system and its impact on communities of color. In some cases, thereâs been bipartisan support for reformâWyomingâs Republican legislature restored the franchise to nonviolent felons last year, and a number of states have streamlined their processes for ex-felons to apply to have their rights restored.		
But more often, the issue has been caught up in partisan wrangling. In 2012, South Carolinaâs Republican legislature stripped voting rights from people on probationâit had previously disenfranchised only those behind bars or on parole. When Kentucky elected Matt Bevin as its governor last year, one of his first acts in office was to rescind his Democratic predecessorâs executive order restoring felonsâ voting rights. And earlier this year, the Maryland legislature had to override two vetoes by Republican Governor Larry Hogan in order to reform that stateâs felon disenfranchisement law.		
Virginiaâs reform highlights the critical importance of state-level politics. In 2013, McAuliffe defeated Ken Cuccinelli, dubbed âthe Attorney General of the Tea Partyâ by People for the American Way, in a squeaker. Cuccinelli had opposed Virginiaâs inclusion under Section Five of the voting Rights Act, which, prior to being overturned by the Supreme Court, required states to submit new voting laws for review, claiming that Virginia had outgrown the need for it, and comparing it to a child ârunning to mommyâ for help. In just the past few weeks, McAuliffe also vetoed a bill that would protect people who discriminate against gays and lesbians, and another defunding Planned Parenthood.		
Asked about the inevitable blowback from Virginia Republicans, McAuliffe says, âI had the legal power to do this, itâs in the state Constitution and the legislature canât do anything about it. But more importantly, morally, it was the right thing to do.â

Before âUnity,â Sanders Must Stay in the Fight

While laws stripping felons of citizenship rights date back to ancient Rome, in the United States, theyâve been inextricably tied to racism and white supremacy. As Brent Staples reported for The New York Times, there was a massive expansion of these laws in the postâCivil War South, âwhen Southern lawmakers were working feverishly to neutralize the black electorate.â According to Staples, âPoll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and cross burnings were effective weapons in this campaign. But statutes that allowed correctional systems to arbitrarily and permanently strip large numbers of people of the right to vote were a particularly potent tool in the campaign to undercut African-American political power.â		
Prior to the launch of the War on Drugs in the 1980s, a majority of prisoners held in state and federal prisons were white, but a 2004 study by scholars at the University of Minnesota found that, between 1850 and 2002, âstates with larger proportions of nonwhites in their prison populations were more likely to pass [disenfranchisement]Â laws, even after statistically controlling for the effects of time, region, economic competition between whites and blacks, partisan control of government, and punitiveness.â
Today, 30 years after the drug war made people of color the majority in Americaâs prisons, African Americans are four times more likely to be stripped of their voting rights than the population as a whole, according to the Sentencing Project.		
The issue has gained greater attention in recent years, in part because of an increased focus on racial biases in the criminal justice system and its impact on communities of color. In some cases, thereâs been bipartisan support for reformâWyomingâs Republican legislature restored the franchise to nonviolent felons last year, and a number of states have streamlined their processes for ex-felons to apply to have their rights restored.		
But more often, the issue has been caught up in partisan wrangling. In 2012, South Carolinaâs Republican legislature stripped voting rights from people on probationâit had previously disenfranchised only those behind bars or on parole. When Kentucky elected Matt Bevin as its governor last year, one of his first acts in office was to rescind his Democratic predecessorâs executive order restoring felonsâ voting rights. And earlier this year, the Maryland legislature had to override two vetoes by Republican Governor Larry Hogan in order to reform that stateâs felon disenfranchisement law.		
Virginiaâs reform highlights the critical importance of state-level politics. In 2013, McAuliffe defeated Ken Cuccinelli, dubbed âthe Attorney General of the Tea Partyâ by People for the American Way, in a squeaker. Cuccinelli had opposed Virginiaâs inclusion under Section Five of the voting Rights Act, which, prior to being overturned by the Supreme Court, required states to submit new voting laws for review, claiming that Virginia had outgrown the need for it, and comparing it to a child ârunning to mommyâ for help. In just the past few weeks, McAuliffe also vetoed a bill that would protect people who discriminate against gays and lesbians, and another defunding Planned Parenthood.		
Asked about the inevitable blowback from Virginia Republicans, McAuliffe says, âI had the legal power to do this, itâs in the state Constitution and the legislature canât do anything about it. But more importantly, morally, it was the right thing to do.â

Did McAuliffe have the legal authority to take this action?  It&apos;s my understanding that as governor, he has the authority to restore a felon&apos;s rights on a case-by-case basis.  It&apos;s not that I object to restoring voting rights to a rehabilitated felon - I just question the governor&apos;s legal standing to take such executive action.

Baby steps are important even if not enough, we&apos;ll take it.
Next?
How about a national law to "Ban The Box?"

To me this highlights the squandering of human resources due to in an exact sense our wide variety of criminal law from state to state.   That&apos;s not going to change, but travesties like this one being ended by Virginia are an example of how problematic our system has become. Just the fact that in a particular state a person has to go through so much inanity just to get back his/her full citizenship says to me how much is not working.  The United States is quite obviously not this easy place for many to navigate, and it would be excellent to see the federal government look into all of these states who still put roadblocks up against ex-offenders if for no other reason than to try to keep them out of participation in civic life.

Thank you, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, Joshua Holland, and Brent Staples reported for The New York Times.  Unfortunately, the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow white racists culture always has been counter productive,  while African-Americans did so much for centuries, to sustain economy and exceptionalism of the United States of America.  The pride of  "white" people, who identify with the Caucasian race, preserves this evil, rather  than admit that their forefathers embraced an evil system.  It is blame-the-victim [African-Americans)] for that victim&apos;s pathetic condition, a vicious circle of "cause-result" fueled by pride that absolves our [white] ancestor&apos; of any responsibility for that evil condition of African-Americans.
