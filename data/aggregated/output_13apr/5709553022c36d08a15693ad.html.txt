Actor Tim Robbins has issued an apology to the people of Guam following a recent joke he made about the island at a Bernie Sanders rally in Wisconsin.

Guam Del. Madeleine Bordallo took Robbinsâ jokeÂ â saying Hillary Clintonâs win of South Carolina in the Democratic primary was âabout as significant as winning Guamâ â as an offensive statement about island residentsâ inability to participate in presidential elections.

Robbins said he was commenting on Guamâs size, not its peopleâs lack of full voting rights.Â Robbins made the controversial joke at an April 4 rally for Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate.

Bordallo, who is seeking re-election, said she was disappointed that Guamâs lack of full voting rights has been reduced to a political punchline.

The actor later posted on Facebook that heÂ "did not mean to disparage" Guam's residents, adding that "we would all be better off if everyone in Guam could actually vote in the presidential election."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Wednesday said at a U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing that itâs âabsurdâ that Americans in Guam and other U.S. territories are treated like âsecond-class citizensâ because theyâre not allowed to vote in presidential elections.

âFour million Americans live on American soil and can only participate in our democracy, but only if they leave home,â Warren said. âAt their homes â on U.S. soil â all of their representation rights disappear,â Warren said.
