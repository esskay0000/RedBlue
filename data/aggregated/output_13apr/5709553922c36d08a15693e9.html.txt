If the Democratic Party had an adult in the roomâif Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC were anything more than a huge corporate money vacuumâthat adult would be telling both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton they need to take a time out. Since this magazine has endorsed Sanders, letâs start with him: It was foolish to claim that Clinton is ânot qualifiedâ to be president, and even more foolish to double down on what sounded like a throwaway remark made in the heat of anger. If taking corporate money makes a candidate unqualified, then no president in the modern era, Democrat or Republican, was qualified. Of course Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. What Sanders should have saidâand probably meantâis that his independence from Wall Street money and oil money and Walmart money makes him better-qualified to be president.

But if weâre going to send Bernieâor his campaign manager Jeff Weaverâto the naughty step, then can we please stop pretending they werenât provoked. Because (in the age appropriate language of fighting 5-year-olds) âshe started it.â Last week Clinton erupted at a rally in upstate New York, saying âI am so sick of the Sanders campaign lyingâ about her contributions from the fossil-fuel industry. Even though it was Greenpeace, not Sanders, who made the specific charge that Clinton had taken $4.5 million in oil and gas moneyâincluding nearly $1.5 million from lobbyistsâit was Clintonâs accusation that set The Washington Post and other MSM outlets into a finger-wagging frenzy. Where was the comparable outrage when Clintonâs campaign manager Robby Mook lied about guns flooding into New York from Vermont, or when Clinton herself claimed Sanders âstood with Minutemen vigilantesâ while they hunted down immigrantsâor when, on the eve of the Michigan primary, she lied about his vote against bailing out Wall Street, claiming that heâd opposed helping General Motors?		
Any honest account of this campaign so far would see Clinton repeatedly gunning for Sandersâfrom the very first debate, when he declined to make an issue of her e-mails, while she tried to paint him as a lackey of the NRAâthen acting like it’s unfair when either Sanders or his campaign staffers dared to criticize her. As this weekâs exchanges prove, Sanders is not just the crinkly grandpa who makes birds suddenly appearâheâs a tough campaigner who doesnât seem to have forgotten the lessons he probably learned growing up on the streets of Brooklyn. Hit him enoughâand in the past few days the Clinton campaign has accused him of lying, twisted his perfectly sensible response to a hostile Daily News interview into supposed âproofâ of his unpreparedness for office, and shamefully recruited the parents of children murdered at Sandy Hook into her attacks on Sandersâand eventually he will hit back. And not in a nice way, either.		
As for whether any of this is sexist, that seems to me a question for women to judgeâjust like white people donât get to decide whatâs racist. But what I will say is that Hillary Clinton can obviously dish it out as well as take itâand that, at least to this voter, it is precisely Clintonâs toughness, her heroic indomitability, from Whitewater to her husbandâs public infidelity to having to see her historic campaign to become the first woman in the White House derailed by Barack Obamaâs own claim to history, that is her most genuinely attractive and appealing characteristic. If I have to hold my nose for Hillary in November, thatâs what Iâll be thinking aboutâthat and the Supreme Court.

New York does funny things to presidential campaigns. For one thing thereâs the tabloid press, viciously jabbing and feinting and seizing any hesitation as a sign of weakness. I know, I was one of them. Then thereâs the cityâs perpetually warring tribes, each expecting a display of fealty and favoritism, and all of them ready to turn in a second on any outsider who puts a foot wrong while sprinting through the minefield. The temptation to âgo thereâ is overwhelming.Â  But it should be resisted. And not just so whoever wins in July isnât fatally damaged before sheâor heâgets to Philadelphia. In 1988 I watched Al Gore follow Marty Peretzâs advice to take the gloves off in New Yorkâand destroy his campaign.		
The truth is, either Democrat would be infinitely preferable to Trump or Cruz. And both have claims to history: Hillary would be the first woman president, and Bernie would be the first Jewâwhich in New York isnât exactly chopped liver. So maybe they ought to move that Brooklyn debate to Madison Square Garden. Because somebody needs to tell both candidates: No biting, no gouging, and no more hitting below the belt.

The substance of the negative campaigning between HRC and Bernie are necessary, since it is to HRC&apos;s advantage that Bernie "stay positive."  She can continue to question his qualifications, his "pie in the sky" platform or untenable banking reforms, while he can say nothing?  Not fair fighting.

All the hay being made to deride Bernie&apos;s deeply honored to have received invitation from the Vatican so will blowback. The irony that MSM is criticizing the same guy they want gone for prioritizing an important moment over a couple more campaign days in New York is absurd. Trying to imply Bernie is pandering. These people are deplorable. From the street level it&apos;s a boss move. Straight confidence. And playing it with New York. Even more boss. If Bernie keeps under ten win lose after a trip to Italy. That&apos;s like a slam-dunk on the whole Clinton Machine that is in over-drive to keep Hillary&apos;s victory viable. Let her try to imply Bernie doesn&apos;t really care about New Yorkers because he went to the Vatican. Bernie&apos;s Foreign Policy focused on peaceful diplomacy has so much pull even the Vatican asked him to address and confer. I wager that the Vatican has had its eyes on Bernie and our movement and being the Vatican wants to align all Catholics with agents of peace. Don&apos;t think the Pope and other Catholics missed the finch landing on Bernie&apos;s podium on Good Friday. And Bernie&apos;s instinctive characterization of the moment was that the bird wants world peace telegraphs his intentions.

Thank you for your well thought out  piece.  As Robert Reich has said, "Hillary is the most qualified candidate for president of the political system we now have, Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have...."  I&apos;m not sure the Clinton Machine will calm down, but glad that Bernie has said he&apos;s ready if they don&apos;t.  Meanwhile, hope his trip to the Vatican gets everyone back in focus on what issues are really important, and that&apos;s making sure we have a government that works for  "the people" and not the 1% greedy oligarchs who are running it now.

"Any honest account of this campaign so far would see Clinton repeatedly gunning for Sanders"

So you are the honest one.  Good to know.

ï»¿Clinton is eminently qualified to be President of a Corporate America. Bernie is the only candidate qualified to be President of an America that treats Main Street and peace in the world as its primary focus, not Wall Street and the military and prison industrial complexes. All the pundits think in terms of meritocracy, not class consciousness and class loyalty. Clinton&apos;s loyalty is to the upper class and to gaining more millions for herself. Bernie&apos;s loyalty is to working people, the middle class and poor folks, he has never used politics to enrich himself, aka taking contributions from Wall Street, oil, big pharma etc. Yes, one needs to be intelligent and understand the world and both qualify. The most important qualification, to quote an old Union slogan, is "Which side are you on?" And folks there is only one candidate that qualifies for being 100% on the side of the vast majority of the people v. Wall Street and big corporations. Bernie Sanders!! And once you understand this there is nothing else to consider. Vote Bernie or get one of the four other corporate America first candidates. This is why Bernie gets treated so badly by all the establishment media, pundits and even the establishment non- profits, Congressional Black Caucus PAC with multiple corporate lobbyist on their BOD, and the Black establishment. The same Black Establishment that disavowed MLK Jr.&apos;s stepping out of the racial justice box by adding "stop the Viet Nam war" and economic justice to his campaign. "Killer Mike" has said it many times, he supports Bernie since he is the only candidate who continues King&apos;s multiple issues agenda for justice.

I could really care less about Hillary becoming our first woman President or for that matter, Bernie becoming our first Jewish one. I recently voted for Bernie in the Ohio primary. I&apos;m a Vietnam veteran and served as a medical corpsman. Bernie voted against the Iraq War resolution.  Hillary voted for it. She said she made a "mistake." It&apos;s a "mistake" that caused the worst foreign policy debacle in our nation&apos;s history since the Vietnam War. It squandered the blood of our precious young men and women in Iraq, and it added three trillion dollars to our national debt according to the Nobel-Prize winning economist Joesph Stiglitz. And in a book tour shown on YouTube, he revised that three trillion as conservative. He has new data from the VA that revised its percentage of severely disabled young veterans needing long-term care from 40% to 50%. He said he had to add another one trillion dollars for their long-term care. So that&apos;s a four trillion dollar "mistake." Does Clinton&apos;s campaign manager Robby Mook have any accurate, reliable data on victims of gun shot wounds from those guns flooding into New York from Vermont? Mark my words, in the run-up to the vote on the Iraq War resolution, I told civilians at work this war would eventually rival the debacle I saw as a young, naive man in Vietnam. Most laughed at my prediction. Some even told me I needed to find a good therapist at the local VA clinic to deal with my lingering issues from Vietnam. Those were the diplomatic comments. I predict if Clinton is elected, which seems to be the likely scenario at this point, she will involve our country in yet another disastrous land war in the region, because she is such a war hawk on foreign policy issues. She learned nothing from her vote for the Iraq War. Look at her support as Secretary of State for our intervention in the Libyan civil war. It turned that oil-rich nation into Somalia on the Mediterranean. It&apos;s a failed state. Just on this issue of war, Clinton&apos;s not qualified to be our next commander in chief. It has nothing to go with her gender or her cozy relationship to Wall Street or the fossil fuel industry or the many millions she and her husband have made on the lecture circuit. Just on that one issue, she just doesn&apos;t deserve to be our next Presdient. By the way, I voted for her husband during his first run for the White House and rejected that smear campaign by the GOP calling him a "draft dodger" during the Vietnam War. So I have no animus against him or her about the Vietnam War or fellow baby boomers who avoided the draft. That was my mistake. I can&apos; take it back. I owned it. I have no one to blame but myself. But unlike Hilalry, I learned from my mistake. And I&apos;m not one of these angry old white guys portrayed so by ardent Clintonistas as a professional "women-hater." She&apos;s just not qualified. And it will be a disaster for the Democratic Party and our country if she becomes the first woman elected to the presidency. It&apos;s more than how one feels about gender politics or feminism. She&apos;s just a war hawk who also happens to be a woman. Just read her interview with Jeffrey Goldberg in The Altantic on her opinions on foreign policy affairs. She hasn&apos;t changed a bit. She&apos;s always been a hammer, and all she sees out there are nails. She just happens to be a woman who has gained power and influence within the Democratic Party.

Thank you for your service. You guys had a real rough go of it there and back here. My father served and he has recently passed do to exposure to agent orange. But he was plagued with more than the physical effects. So war has touched my life in profound ways. I don&apos;t take it lightly being knowledgable about everything from a Vets story to is NATO relevant. 

I agree. Hillary rhetoric is pro-war. She doesn&apos;t exhibit Military Thinking.  Scary thing is I suspect her diehard supporters don&apos;t care or pay attention to war. They see a blip and think Hillary deals with that stuff. and moves on. They just like her saying, "I&apos;m protecting Americans by getting "bad" guys."

You made a lot of great points and one idea that really rung the bell is the idea of "deserving" the Presidency. The mood has been Hillary deserves to be just because she qualified and experienced. Therefore she is entitled to it. No, its a competition. First, you have to defeat my candidate, who&apos;s not fading away. And if you somehow manage that, you still have to defeat the next guy to be the President.
