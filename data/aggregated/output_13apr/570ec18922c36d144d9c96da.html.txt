 (CNN)Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made headlines last year when he proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The proposal was met with widespread skepticism, especially his insistence that Mexico would also pay for the construction of such a wall. Undeterred, Trump this week explained how he would make this happen, outlining in a policy memo posted to his website a plan to cut off money transfers by immigrants in the United States to their families in Mexico.
