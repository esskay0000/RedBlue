MAY 3--A woman last week contacted Florida cops to report that she believed a pair of chicken sandwiches purchased at KFC âcontained semen,â according to a police report.

The unidentified customer went to the Manatee County Sheriffâs Office and told officials there that she bought the sandwiches from a Bradenton restaurant.

No arrests have been made in connection with the alleged food adulteration, which is âstill under investigation,â according to a sheriffâs spokesperson.

The brief police report, which characterizes the matter as âsuspicious incidents,â does not indicate whether the woman consumed any of the food.

Since the woman provided cops with the chicken sandwiches, investigators were able to swab the food for possible biological evidence. (1 page)
