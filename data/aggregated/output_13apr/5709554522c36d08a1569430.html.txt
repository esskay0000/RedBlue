NEW YORK --Â While Republicans in Colorado were waiting to hear an in-person appeal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Donald Trump visited the 9/11 memorial here for the first time â a brief, quiet event that was opened, then closed, to reporters.

Some invited members of the media gathered at 10 a.m. outside Trump Tower, then huddled together in a van as a growing crowed waited for a glimpse of the Republican presidential front-runner. At noon, Trump and his wife, Melania, emerged to shouts of âYay, Donald!â They piled into an SUV, then headed toward the West Side Highway, zipping around traffic.

At 12:15, some New York-based journalists realized he was going to the memorial, which opened in 2011. When the motorcade arrived, Trump, his wife and a small entourage that included campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and social media manager Daniel Scavino, hustled inside under umbrellas.

The press, including several photographers and cameramen, was ordered by security to hold tight in a van. That left the semi-official documentation of the event to Twitter users, who appeared universally surprised to see Trump inside. Trump had not donated to the major charities and causes that helpedÂ first responders recover from damage incurred on Sept. 11, 2001, but he had referenced the attacks multiple times after Cruz accused him of embodying liberal, suspect "New York values."

For a half-hour, reporters were told to expect Trump to come out and address them on camera. There was a 10-minute warning, then a five-minute warning, and a scramble to a location away from the memorial itself. But at 12:48, Trump et al. emerged again and headed straight into their SUVs. They zoomed past the stalled press van, and the candidate waved at reporters through tinted windows, as the gaggle was officially canceled. The van followed Trump back uptown, parked behind him, then emptied out as reporters -- in vain -- sought a comment from the candidate.

By leaving the cameras outside, Trump avoided any suggestion that his visit to the memorial was a photo op. Still, the confusingly organized event capped a week of odd false starts. His campaign considered, then mooted, a fly-in to Colorado Springs at the start of the state convention. It announced, then scrapped, a Friday press conference in California.
