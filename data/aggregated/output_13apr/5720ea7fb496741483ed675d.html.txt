Tinder has launched an app for allowing people to find groups of friends â but has already faced claim that it is embarrassing people and facilitating group sex.

The company has announced that it is testing âTinder Socialâ, a new feature meant for matching people with groups rather than with one person in particular. And it is already proving controversial.

Since the app relies on inviting Facebook friends along to potential meetups, it allows users to see all of their friends on Tinder who might be interested in coming along.

Do you have an old broken smartphone lying around the house somewhere? Then why not turn it into a robot? That's exactly what YouTuber Mehdi Sadaghdar did in a recent video, after his efforts to bring a destroyed phone back to life disastrously failed. Using the phone's vibrator, a coin battery, a simple switch, a few wires and the bristly part of a toothbrush, he managed to make a simple little toy that can skitter around a tabletop as long as the battery last

It isnât clear whether the company intends to announce more details before pre-orders begin

A new trick shows a quick way of getting rid of the stock apps that might be cluttering up your iPhone screen â at least for a while.

But the new trick shows how you can hide those unused stock apps with just a quick trick using some folders

The CES 2016 gadget show is about to kick off, and nearly the entire technology industry has descended on Las Vegas to try and show off the future. Every year, companies and technologists attempt to show that they have seen whatâs coming and that they will be there to offer it. Every year, a lot of people get it wrong. This yearâs expectations are as big as ever. Every year, CES unofficially gets a big theme that everythingâs supposed to be about â this year thatâs virtual reality. There is also future for cars, smart home and wearables

Uber has added a lift-sharing feature to its app in London, allowing people to share their taxi with a stranger in return for a reduced fair. Users will be given 25 per cent off their journey if they say they will let up to two other passengers share their car. Drivers will then receive a message telling them that theyâll be picking up more than one fare, and can plan their route accordingly. London is the second European country to get the feature, after Paris. It was first launched in San Francisco and now most people who use the app do so with the feature

An attempt to build the worldâs biggest Rubikâs cube ended in disaster when the puzzle exploded as it was turned for the first time. One of the masterminds behind Coren Puzzle, a YouTube channel dedicated to custom puzzles, live-streamed the final assembly of the 22x22 cube. The video was the culmination of seven months of construction, which included a month of deliberation on how to build the mechanism at the centre of the device

The maker of a new chip claims that it could reduce the charging times of phones to a few minutes, and could prevent dangerous explosions. The tiny chip could be embedded into batteries of all sizes and monitor how healthy and charged they are. That in turn would mean that the batteries would become much safer and quicker to charge, according to the scientist that developed it. Unhealthy lithium-ion batteries can be at risk of exploding or catching fire, as well as gradually losing their capacity so that they run out more quickly. Those problems may become even more important as people move towards electric cars or other vehicles

Nasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Apple has released a bright pink new iPhone 6s â likely the only way that youâll be able to tell that someone has the new handset. The company released the new phone with much fanfare, but almost all of the changes â a new camera and pressure-sensitive display â were on the inside. The only new noticeable addition to the phoneâs look is the very pink rose gold colour, and a tiny âSâ on the back. The new handsets will be released on September 25

Apple has launched a huge new iPad, which it hopes can bring the tablet to offices and designers. But it unveiled it with an Apple-designed stylus â an idea that was famously mocked by late Apple founder Steve Jobs

But that means that it exposes everyone who is on the dating app â whether or not they want to be found out. It also makes it easy to look at friendsâ profiles on the site, making it a perfect way for âyour Facebook friends [to] laugh at your bio at Tinderâ, as one Twitter user pointed out.

Tinder users who want to stay private can opt out of the test feature, by heading to the settings. But it is at the moment opt in for those that have it â meaning that people could be sharing the fact they are on Tinder with their friends without even knowing.

And even for those who are happy to announce that they are on the site, Tinder Socialâs purpose is still unclear. It is apparently meant to facilitate platonic group meetups â but people have already pointed out that since Tinder is often used for casual sex, the feature appears to be useful for finding people to engage in group sex with.Â 

The company announced the feature with a blog post that said it was a way of taking âan average night out with your friends to the next levelâ.

That matches the same coy ways that Tinder has described itself in the past. The company continues to insist in public that it is primarily an app for allowing people to make new friends â and the companyâs official account sent out a string of angry tweets last year when an article said that it was contributing to hookup culture.

For the moment, the feature is only being tested with âa small group of users in Australiaâ. It said that it would be launched globally âsoonâ.
