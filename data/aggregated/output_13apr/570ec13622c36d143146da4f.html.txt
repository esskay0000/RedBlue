A German comedian has been placed under police protection after reading a crude poem aboutÂ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on television.Â 

A police car was parked in front of Jan BÃ¶hmermannâs house, although it was not immediately clear if a concrete threat had been made against him.Â 

German newspaper Bild website reported that the satirist and his family were allegedly facing a threat from the Turkish presidentâs supporters.

Mr Erdogan has filed a criminal complaint as a private individual to the highest court in the land against the satirist, the Turkish presidentâs German lawyer told broadcaster ZDF on Tuesday night.

German prosecutors are looking into whether he broke a law against insulting foreign leaders.

Mr BÃ¶hmermann read the poem making references to sex with sheep and accusing the Turkish president of âslapping Christians while watching child pornâ on his Neo Magazin Royale programme on March 31.

He emphasised that it included material that broke German laws on free speech - section 103 of the criminal code prohibits insulting organs or representatives of foreign states.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has herself been criticised after she called the poem âdeliberately offensiveâ, with political opponents accusing her of jeopardising freedom of speech in order to firm up the EU-Turkey deal on returning migrants from the Greek islands. 

Â 

Mrs Merkel said on Tuesday that the deal with Turkey bore no relation to the legal action facing MrÂ BÃ¶hmermannâs, insisting that "freedom of the press, opinion and science apply and are completely separate from thatâ.

The centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), junior partners in the coalition government, said on Tuesday that Germany should scrap the law. âThe honour of a head of state is just as important as the honour of a normal citizen,â said Thomas Oppermann, SPD leader in the German parliament.
