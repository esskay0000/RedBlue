Donald Trump on Wednesday accused Hillary Clinton of starting the so-called âbirtherâ movement, which raised unfounded questions about President Obamaâs birthplace and American citizenship.

âYou know who started the birth movement? You know who started it? Do you know who questioned his birth certificate, one of the first? Hillary Clinton,â Trump told CNNâs Wolf Blitzer Wednesday. âSheâs the one that started it. She brought it up years before it was brought up by me.â

The real estate mogul was responding to video footage of Clinton blasting Trump for questioning where the president was born and demanding that he release his birth certificate.

âThe leading Republican contender is the man who led the insidious birther movement to discredit the presidentâs citizenship,â Clinton said during a campaign event Sunday.

Trump dismissed those claims, repeating an oft-cited â but debunked â suggestion that Clinton herself was the first to question Obamaâs birthplace. Several independent fact-checkers investigated the claims and concluded that they were unfounded. FactCheck.org wrote last year that, â[w]hile itâs true that some of her ardent supporters pushed the theory, there is no evidence that Clinton or her campaign had anything to do with it.â

Pressed on where he stood with regards to the presidentâs birthplace today, Trump said that heâs not interested in discussing the issue further.

âI donât talk about it anymore because every time I talk about it, it becomes a story, so I donât want to waste my time talking about it anymore,â Trump said.
