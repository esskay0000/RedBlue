A new poll released Wednesday from Monmouth University underscores the possibleÂ schism that could unfold atÂ this summerâs Republican convention.

Fifty-four percent of Republicans say their party should get behind front-runner DonaldÂ Trump at a contested convention if he still has the most delegates come July 18.

Thirty-four percent of Republican voters would want to see another candidate nominated.

Among Republicans who would want a candidate besides Trump nominated at a contested convention, 33% think Ted Cruz should get the nod, while 23% back John Kasich.

(Also-rans and non-candidates like Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan got some support, too.)

âA majority of non-Trump supporters seem to be in favor of a brokered convention process at this point in the campaign,â said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouthâs Polling Institute. â

âThat would probably throw the party into turmoil with many Trump supporters abandoning the party.â

Meanwhile, another new poll out WednesdayÂ showed Kasich standing a better chance in the general election than Trump, andÂ Democratic underdog Bernie Sanders faring better in November than his rival, Hillary Clinton.
