Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump reignited their Twitter war Wednesday (their disdain for one another isn’t new) after Trump insulted her record as a senator and again questioned her Native American ancestry. Trump has repeatedly attempted to dredge up a controversy from Warren’s 2012 Massachusetts Senate campaign.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

But Warren didn't hesitate to retaliate, firing off more than half a dozen tweets within an hour directed at Trump.

We get it, @realDonaldTrump: When a woman stands up to you, you’re going to call her a basket case. Hormonal. Ugly.

Do you think you're going to shut us up, @realDonaldTrump? Think again. It's time to answer for your dangerous ideas.

You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?

You feel so much for people with college debt, @realDonaldTrump, that you raked in millions scamming students with Trump University?

You're so concerned about Wall Street, @realDonaldTrump, that you say you’d “absolutely” repeal Dodd-Frank?

When asked what gov should stop doing, @realDonaldTrump said overseeing banks! How can you be tough on Wall Street by letting them off?

.@realDonaldTrump: Your policies are dangerous. Your words are reckless. Your record is embarrassing. And your free ride is over.

Later Wednesday, Trump responded.

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”
