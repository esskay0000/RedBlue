Tuesday was a very good night for Bernie Sanders. He beat Hillary Clinton in the Wisconsin primary.

That win should have been a springboard for Sanders heading into the New York primary on April 19. It wasn't.

Here's why.

First, Sanders did an interview with the editorial board of the New York Daily News. In the discussion, a transcript of which was posted on Monday, Sanders came across as the proverbial dog who caught the car. He struggled to explain (or to seemingly understand) the consequences of many of his policies and looked for all the world like someone who, in the words of Clinton, had not done his homework.

Then came Sanders's inexplicable decision to engage with Clinton on the question of who was (and was not) "qualified" to be president.  Of course, Sanders was, by his recounting, simply responding to Clinton's previous questioning of his readiness for office -- which she did even if she came up short of saying the exact words.

But then, suddenly on Friday morning, Sanders totally reversed course -- acknowledging that "of course" Clinton was qualified to be president.

Er, what? Sanders spent the two days after his big Wisconsin win attacking Clinton on an issue -- qualifications -- that is, without question, her strong suit in the race. Then he walked away from the attack with no explanation.

That, of course, allowed Clinton to take the high road and look magnanimous.

A final indignity: An Emerson College poll came out on Friday showing Clinton at 56 percent to Sanders's 38 percent in New York.

Seventy two hours after Sanders's win in Wisconsin, that victory felt like a distant memory.

Bernie Sanders, for frittering away your momentum, you had the Worst Week in Washington. Congrats, or something.

Each week, I award the worst week in Washington to an inhabitant of Planet Beltway who stands out for all the wrong reasons. You can check out previous winners or e-mail me with candidates.
