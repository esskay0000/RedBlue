As Senator Bernie Sanders cruised to a big win on Tuesday, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, made two bold statements that Hillary Clinton supporters found questionable and offensive. The clash highlights the difficulties the Democratic Party is going to have reconciling Clinton and Sanders supporters in the fall—difficulties that will be serious, on both sides, but I don’t believe insurmountable.

I’m going to let someone else talk about what the Sanders forces will find tough about falling in line behind Clinton. I know there are a lot of issues. As a Clinton supporter and a lifelong Democrat who nonetheless wants Sanders to succeed in pulling the party to the left, let me explain what was wrong with Weaver’s comments. And let me try to tease out the difference between his first two provocative pronouncements.		
The morning of the Wisconsin primary, Weaver told CNN’s Chris Cuomo he anticipated an “open convention” for the Democrats, akin to what the Republican contest is shaping up to be, where Sanders will wind up being the Democratic nominee. Even though Clinton currently leads in pledged delegates, by a lot—more than Barack Obama ever did—and even though most non-aligned analysts think that lead is insurmountable. Weaver claimed, “It is very, very, very unlikely that either candidate, either Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders, will go into the convention with a majority needed of pledged delegates in order to win. And so in essence the Democratic convention will be an open convention.”
Much more disturbingly, Weaver closed his big day by telling CNN’s Jake Tapper, who asked about the increasingly bitter tone of both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, that “This is what I would say to [Clinton’s campaign].… Don’t destroy the Democratic Party to satisfy the secretary’s ambitions to become president of the United States. Right, you want to have a party at the end of this we can unify.”		
Then, as I was finishing this piece, another skirmish broke out over Sanders’s saying Clinton was “not qualified” to be president—which probably sounded more insulting than it might have, had Weaver not made those other remarks this week.		
Clinton supporters, including me, found these statements wildly provocative. But they’re actually different, in tone and in substance. The comment about Clinton’s “destructive” ambition was arrogant, condescending, and, yes, sexist. In response to Weaver, MTV’s Jamil Smith revived this on-point 10-year-old chestnut from The Onion: “Hillary Clinton is too ambitious to be the first female president.” Clinton and Sanders are running a spirited campaign for the presidency, which has been mostly high-minded and collegial, with occasional sharp elbows thrown by both parties. How did her ambition come to be the one that’s called “destructive”? (One guess.) Arguably, since Sanders is trailing in pledged delegates, in the popular vote, and even in the number of states won to date, and since he is the candidate that analysts give virtually zero chance of edging Clinton, one could argue that is his “ambition” that threatens to “destroy” the party.

I am not arguing that. Nor am I saying—just as no serious Clinton supporter is saying, to my knowledge—that Sanders should drop out of the race. Clinton herself stayed in it, competing with President Obama, until the very last 2008 primaries (she won two out of three in early June of that year), even though Obama backers demanded as early as February that she suspend her campaign. I think it’s good for the party if the nomination contest continues. I throw no shade at Sanders just because he’s a Democrat-come-lately; as I’ve written repeatedly, I’m happy he’s running inside the party, not undermining it like Ralph Nader did in 2000. I support his effort to pull it to the left. The question, though, is how.		
That brings me to Weaver’s other comment, about looking forward to an “open convention.” It was certainly provocative, but it also represented Weaver doing his job. He wants to find a way to make the ultimate case for Sanders as the Democratic nominee—and for Sanders to have maximum impact at the convention, on the platform, and in the party going forward, if he falls short. So I have less of a problem with it, even if I cringed when he said it. I cringed partly because the Clinton campaign never called for anything like an open convention. But hey: Sanders isn’t bound to the rules the Clinton camp followed eight years ago.

Although lots of people have compared the nastiness of the 2016 Democratic contest to the historic 2008 campaign between Clinton and Barack Obama, as a veteran of both, let me say definitively: Two thousand eight was far more bitter, on both sides. Back then, Clinton was in Sanders’s place: running a strong but perpetually behind campaign, with lots of victories later in the game, but probably too far in back of Obama in pledged delegates to ever catch up. There were worries about bringing the two wings of the parties together–worries that neither campaigns did anything to assuage until it was over in June.		
By contrast: Yes, there’s a loud #BernieOrBust movement on social media, but there were, objectively, far more Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they’d never vote for Obama. In May of that year, exit polls from Indiana showed almost half of Clintonistas couldn’t imagine a vote for Obama; at the end of the primaries, CNN found that 35 percent felt that way. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, exit polls showed about a third of Sanders supporters in that decisively pro-Bernie state said they wouldn’t vote for Clinton. That’s a worrisome number, but it’s not what we saw eight years ago.

							});
						
But comparisons of 2008 and 2016 fail in a lot of ways, including one major dynamic: There were few ideological differences between Clinton and Obama. Pulling their forces together was largely a matter of personal and political respect, which was a tough challenge, since it was lacking on both sides. But by contrast, the Sanders campaign is trying to pull Clinton, and the party, to the left.		
So making up at the end of this contest won’t be as easy.		
Another difference: Most Clinton supporters recognized the historic nature of Obama’s candidacy, as the possible first black president, and were restrained by it—and ultimately inspired by it. Too many Sanders supporters—including, I would say, Jeff Weaver—seem not to be similarly respectful of the front-running candidacy of the potential first woman president. Thus Weaver’s complaints about Clinton’s “ambition” merged seamlessly, in the ears of her supporters, with their earlier discomfort over his promise of an open convention. There is also Weaver’s early salvo in the gender war between the two candidates, when he suggested Sanders would consider Clinton as his vice president. “Look, she’d make a great vice president,” he told Bloomberg in October. “We’re willing to give her more credit than Obama did. We’re willing to consider her for vice president. We’ll give her serious consideration. We’ll even interview her.”		
They’ll even interview the front-runner. That was a magic moment. And here’s a question for the Sanders forces now: How do you deny the first leading female candidate the Democratic nomination for president, when she’s ahead in the pledged delegates, the popular vote, and even the number of states won, as she almost certainly will be?		
The answer is: You can’t. If that’s the way Clinton comes into the July convention in Philadelphia—ahead in delegates and the popular vote, but just shy of the goal, without superdelegates—Sanders, and the party, absolutely can’t. And I predict the party won’t.		
Yet Sanders himself has said he plans to appeal to superdelegates to help him pass Clinton and get him over the top. “I think the momentum is with us,” he told CNN last week. “A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton. A lot have not yet declared. And then you have got superdelegates who are in states where we win by 40 or 50 points. I think their own constituents are going to say to them, ‘Hey, why don’t you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?’” He also suggested that he could turn superdelegates in states that Clinton won, with an argument that he’s more electable. He hopes they will “begin to look at the reality, and that is, in poll after poll, we are beating Donald Trump by much larger margins than is Secretary Clinton.”		
All of this is ironic, given that his campaign has suggested that getting rid of superdelegates would be one issue on which he would want to press Clinton if he winds up in Democratic platform negotiations. And again, as a veteran of 2008, I know that the Clinton folks had stopped talking about appealing to superdelegates at this point in the race; they were too busy arguing that she had the right to continue to compete for pledged delegates.		
One more 2008 comparison: That year, Clinton was behind in pledged delegates, but leading in the popular vote slightly. She nonetheless didn’t press her cause at the Denver convention. None of her campaign leaders ever called for an “open convention.” So while the lefty in me understands why Sanders and Weaver would, and perhaps should (in the reasoning of his supporters), the feminist and the lifelong Democrat in me says: Rethink this, Sanders folks, if Clinton goes to Philadelphia with a lead in pledged delegates. Please.		
Even if he wrests away the nomination somehow, he’ll alienate Democratic women, and perhaps Republican and independent women too. He’ll also alienate black women even more than he already has with his campaign’s constant dismissal of Clinton’s victories in the South. We all feel confident that no Democrat can lose to Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, but I can honestly think of one way: If a Democrat were stupid enough to insult female voters, early and often.		
So while I believe there could ultimately, theoretically, be a path for Sanders to take his crusade to the Democratic convention if he’s behind in pledged delegates, I would hope it never happens. I can understand why his campaign might think that’s their best leverage, because I worked hard to wrap my brain around it, as a member of the left wing of the party he is trying to represent. I can imagine accepting it. But only—and I feel this is a long shot right now, but I am open to being convinced—if he can do it without the air of condescension and entitlement his campaign exudes right now.

Clinton herself stayed in it, competing with President Obama, until the very last 2008 primaries (she won two out of three in early June of that year), even though Obama backers demanded as early as February that she suspend her campaign. I think it’s good for the party if the nomination contest continues. I throw no shade at Sanders just because he’s a Democrat-come-lately; as I’ve written repeatedly, I’m happy he’s running inside the party, not undermining it like Ralph Nader did in 2000. I support his effort to pull it to the left. The question, though, is how.		
That brings me to Weaver’s other comment, about looking forward to an “open convention.” It was certainly provocative, but it also represented Weaver doing his job. He wants to find a way to make the ultimate case for Sanders as the Democratic nominee—and for Sanders to have maximum impact at the convention, on the platform, and in the party going forward, if he falls short. So I have less of a problem with it, even if I cringed when he said it. I cringed partly because the Clinton campaign never called for anything like an open convention. But hey: Sanders isn’t bound to the rules the Clinton camp followed eight years ago.

Although lots of people have compared the nastiness of the 2016 Democratic contest to the historic 2008 campaign between Clinton and Barack Obama, as a veteran of both, let me say definitively: Two thousand eight was far more bitter, on both sides. Back then, Clinton was in Sanders’s place: running a strong but perpetually behind campaign, with lots of victories later in the game, but probably too far in back of Obama in pledged delegates to ever catch up. There were worries about bringing the two wings of the parties together–worries that neither campaigns did anything to assuage until it was over in June.		
By contrast: Yes, there’s a loud #BernieOrBust movement on social media, but there were, objectively, far more Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they’d never vote for Obama. In May of that year, exit polls from Indiana showed almost half of Clintonistas couldn’t imagine a vote for Obama; at the end of the primaries, CNN found that 35 percent felt that way. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, exit polls showed about a third of Sanders supporters in that decisively pro-Bernie state said they wouldn’t vote for Clinton. That’s a worrisome number, but it’s not what we saw eight years ago.

But comparisons of 2008 and 2016 fail in a lot of ways, including one major dynamic: There were few ideological differences between Clinton and Obama. Pulling their forces together was largely a matter of personal and political respect, which was a tough challenge, since it was lacking on both sides. But by contrast, the Sanders campaign is trying to pull Clinton, and the party, to the left.		
So making up at the end of this contest won’t be as easy.		
Another difference: Most Clinton supporters recognized the historic nature of Obama’s candidacy, as the possible first black president, and were restrained by it—and ultimately inspired by it. Too many Sanders supporters—including, I would say, Jeff Weaver—seem not to be similarly respectful of the front-running candidacy of the potential first woman president. Thus Weaver’s complaints about Clinton’s “ambition” merged seamlessly, in the ears of her supporters, with their earlier discomfort over his promise of an open convention. There is also Weaver’s early salvo in the gender war between the two candidates, when he suggested Sanders would consider Clinton as his vice president. “Look, she’d make a great vice president,” he told Bloomberg in October. “We’re willing to give her more credit than Obama did. We’re willing to consider her for vice president. We’ll give her serious consideration. We’ll even interview her.”		
They’ll even interview the front-runner. That was a magic moment. And here’s a question for the Sanders forces now: How do you deny the first leading female candidate the Democratic nomination for president, when she’s ahead in the pledged delegates, the popular vote, and even the number of states won, as she almost certainly will be?		
The answer is: You can’t. If that’s the way Clinton comes into the July convention in Philadelphia—ahead in delegates and the popular vote, but just shy of the goal, without superdelegates—Sanders, and the party, absolutely can’t. And I predict the party won’t.		
Yet Sanders himself has said he plans to appeal to superdelegates to help him pass Clinton and get him over the top. “I think the momentum is with us,” he told CNN last week. “A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton. A lot have not yet declared. And then you have got superdelegates who are in states where we win by 40 or 50 points. I think their own constituents are going to say to them, ‘Hey, why don’t you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?’” He also suggested that he could turn superdelegates in states that Clinton won, with an argument that he’s more electable. He hopes they will “begin to look at the reality, and that is, in poll after poll, we are beating Donald Trump by much larger margins than is Secretary Clinton.”		
All of this is ironic, given that his campaign has suggested that getting rid of superdelegates would be one issue on which he would want to press Clinton if he winds up in Democratic platform negotiations. And again, as a veteran of 2008, I know that the Clinton folks had stopped talking about appealing to superdelegates at this point in the race; they were too busy arguing that she had the right to continue to compete for pledged delegates.		
One more 2008 comparison: That year, Clinton was behind in pledged delegates, but leading in the popular vote slightly. She nonetheless didn’t press her cause at the Denver convention. None of her campaign leaders ever called for an “open convention.” So while the lefty in me understands why Sanders and Weaver would, and perhaps should (in the reasoning of his supporters), the feminist and the lifelong Democrat in me says: Rethink this, Sanders folks, if Clinton goes to Philadelphia with a lead in pledged delegates. Please.		
Even if he wrests away the nomination somehow, he’ll alienate Democratic women, and perhaps Republican and independent women too. He’ll also alienate black women even more than he already has with his campaign’s constant dismissal of Clinton’s victories in the South. We all feel confident that no Democrat can lose to Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, but I can honestly think of one way: If a Democrat were stupid enough to insult female voters, early and often.		
So while I believe there could ultimately, theoretically, be a path for Sanders to take his crusade to the Democratic convention if he’s behind in pledged delegates, I would hope it never happens. I can understand why his campaign might think that’s their best leverage, because I worked hard to wrap my brain around it, as a member of the left wing of the party he is trying to represent. I can imagine accepting it. But only—and I feel this is a long shot right now, but I am open to being convinced—if he can do it without the air of condescension and entitlement his campaign exudes right now.		
		

Then, as I was finishing this piece, another skirmish broke out over Sanders’s saying Clinton was “not qualified” to be president—which probably sounded more insulting than it might have, had Weaver not made those other remarks this week.		
Clinton supporters, including me, found these statements wildly provocative. But they’re actually different, in tone and in substance. The comment about Clinton’s “destructive” ambition was arrogant, condescending, and, yes, sexist. In response to Weaver, MTV’s Jamil Smith revived this on-point 10-year-old chestnut from The Onion: “Hillary Clinton is too ambitious to be the first female president.” Clinton and Sanders are running a spirited campaign for the presidency, which has been mostly high-minded and collegial, with occasional sharp elbows thrown by both parties. How did her ambition come to be the one that’s called “destructive”? (One guess.) Arguably, since Sanders is trailing in pledged delegates, in the popular vote, and even in the number of states won to date, and since he is the candidate that analysts give virtually zero chance of edging Clinton, one could argue that is his “ambition” that threatens to “destroy” the party.

But only—and I feel this is a long shot right now, but I am open to being convinced—if he can do it without the air of condescension and entitlement his campaign exudes right now.		
		

That brings me to Weaver’s other comment, about looking forward to an “open convention.” It was certainly provocative, but it also represented Weaver doing his job. He wants to find a way to make the ultimate case for Sanders as the Democratic nominee—and for Sanders to have maximum impact at the convention, on the platform, and in the party going forward, if he falls short. So I have less of a problem with it, even if I cringed when he said it. I cringed partly because the Clinton campaign never called for anything like an open convention. But hey: Sanders isn’t bound to the rules the Clinton camp followed eight years ago.

Although lots of people have compared the nastiness of the 2016 Democratic contest to the historic 2008 campaign between Clinton and Barack Obama, as a veteran of both, let me say definitively: Two thousand eight was far more bitter, on both sides. Back then, Clinton was in Sanders’s place: running a strong but perpetually behind campaign, with lots of victories later in the game, but probably too far in back of Obama in pledged delegates to ever catch up. There were worries about bringing the two wings of the parties together–worries that neither campaigns did anything to assuage until it was over in June.		
By contrast: Yes, there’s a loud #BernieOrBust movement on social media, but there were, objectively, far more Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they’d never vote for Obama. In May of that year, exit polls from Indiana showed almost half of Clintonistas couldn’t imagine a vote for Obama; at the end of the primaries, CNN found that 35 percent felt that way. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, exit polls showed about a third of Sanders supporters in that decisively pro-Bernie state said they wouldn’t vote for Clinton. That’s a worrisome number, but it’s not what we saw eight years ago.

But comparisons of 2008 and 2016 fail in a lot of ways, including one major dynamic: There were few ideological differences between Clinton and Obama. Pulling their forces together was largely a matter of personal and political respect, which was a tough challenge, since it was lacking on both sides. But by contrast, the Sanders campaign is trying to pull Clinton, and the party, to the left.		
So making up at the end of this contest won’t be as easy.		
Another difference: Most Clinton supporters recognized the historic nature of Obama’s candidacy, as the possible first black president, and were restrained by it—and ultimately inspired by it. Too many Sanders supporters—including, I would say, Jeff Weaver—seem not to be similarly respectful of the front-running candidacy of the potential first woman president. Thus Weaver’s complaints about Clinton’s “ambition” merged seamlessly, in the ears of her supporters, with their earlier discomfort over his promise of an open convention. There is also Weaver’s early salvo in the gender war between the two candidates, when he suggested Sanders would consider Clinton as his vice president. “Look, she’d make a great vice president,” he told Bloomberg in October. “We’re willing to give her more credit than Obama did. We’re willing to consider her for vice president. We’ll give her serious consideration. We’ll even interview her.”		
They’ll even interview the front-runner. That was a magic moment. And here’s a question for the Sanders forces now: How do you deny the first leading female candidate the Democratic nomination for president, when she’s ahead in the pledged delegates, the popular vote, and even the number of states won, as she almost certainly will be?		
The answer is: You can’t. If that’s the way Clinton comes into the July convention in Philadelphia—ahead in delegates and the popular vote, but just shy of the goal, without superdelegates—Sanders, and the party, absolutely can’t. And I predict the party won’t.		
Yet Sanders himself has said he plans to appeal to superdelegates to help him pass Clinton and get him over the top. “I think the momentum is with us,” he told CNN last week. “A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton. A lot have not yet declared. And then you have got superdelegates who are in states where we win by 40 or 50 points. I think their own constituents are going to say to them, ‘Hey, why don’t you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?’” He also suggested that he could turn superdelegates in states that Clinton won, with an argument that he’s more electable. He hopes they will “begin to look at the reality, and that is, in poll after poll, we are beating Donald Trump by much larger margins than is Secretary Clinton.”		
All of this is ironic, given that his campaign has suggested that getting rid of superdelegates would be one issue on which he would want to press Clinton if he winds up in Democratic platform negotiations. And again, as a veteran of 2008, I know that the Clinton folks had stopped talking about appealing to superdelegates at this point in the race; they were too busy arguing that she had the right to continue to compete for pledged delegates.		
One more 2008 comparison: That year, Clinton was behind in pledged delegates, but leading in the popular vote slightly. She nonetheless didn’t press her cause at the Denver convention. None of her campaign leaders ever called for an “open convention.” So while the lefty in me understands why Sanders and Weaver would, and perhaps should (in the reasoning of his supporters), the feminist and the lifelong Democrat in me says: Rethink this, Sanders folks, if Clinton goes to Philadelphia with a lead in pledged delegates. Please.		
Even if he wrests away the nomination somehow, he’ll alienate Democratic women, and perhaps Republican and independent women too. He’ll also alienate black women even more than he already has with his campaign’s constant dismissal of Clinton’s victories in the South. We all feel confident that no Democrat can lose to Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, but I can honestly think of one way: If a Democrat were stupid enough to insult female voters, early and often.		
So while I believe there could ultimately, theoretically, be a path for Sanders to take his crusade to the Democratic convention if he’s behind in pledged delegates, I would hope it never happens. I can understand why his campaign might think that’s their best leverage, because I worked hard to wrap my brain around it, as a member of the left wing of the party he is trying to represent. I can imagine accepting it. But only—and I feel this is a long shot right now, but I am open to being convinced—if he can do it without the air of condescension and entitlement his campaign exudes right now.

One more 2008 comparison: That year, Clinton was behind in pledged delegates, but leading in the popular vote slightly. She nonetheless didn’t press her cause at the Denver convention. None of her campaign leaders ever called for an “open convention.” So while the lefty in me understands why Sanders and Weaver would, and perhaps should (in the reasoning of his supporters), the feminist and the lifelong Democrat in me says: Rethink this, Sanders folks, if Clinton goes to Philadelphia with a lead in pledged delegates. Please.		
Even if he wrests away the nomination somehow, he’ll alienate Democratic women, and perhaps Republican and independent women too. He’ll also alienate black women even more than he already has with his campaign’s constant dismissal of Clinton’s victories in the South. We all feel confident that no Democrat can lose to Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, but I can honestly think of one way: If a Democrat were stupid enough to insult female voters, early and often.		
So while I believe there could ultimately, theoretically, be a path for Sanders to take his crusade to the Democratic convention if he’s behind in pledged delegates, I would hope it never happens. I can understand why his campaign might think that’s their best leverage, because I worked hard to wrap my brain around it, as a member of the left wing of the party he is trying to represent. I can imagine accepting it. But only—and I feel this is a long shot right now, but I am open to being convinced—if he can do it without the air of condescension and entitlement his campaign exudes right now.		
		

The answer is: You can’t. If that’s the way Clinton comes into the July convention in Philadelphia—ahead in delegates and the popular vote, but just shy of the goal, without superdelegates—Sanders, and the party, absolutely can’t. And I predict the party won’t.		
Yet Sanders himself has said he plans to appeal to superdelegates to help him pass Clinton and get him over the top. “I think the momentum is with us,” he told CNN last week. “A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton. A lot have not yet declared. And then you have got superdelegates who are in states where we win by 40 or 50 points. I think their own constituents are going to say to them, ‘Hey, why don’t you support the people of our state, vote for Sanders?’” He also suggested that he could turn superdelegates in states that Clinton won, with an argument that he’s more electable. He hopes they will “begin to look at the reality, and that is, in poll after poll, we are beating Donald Trump by much larger margins than is Secretary Clinton.”

I am a woman, in my 60s, and I love Bernie!

Funny. No mention ever of the first Jewish President. According to the "Sexist!!" mantra of the Hillary side, the Bernie side should be shouting "Anti Semitism!!" as people like Joan Walsh write glowingly of the lovely church people of South Carolina who quietly bolster The Goy Ceiling.

Condescension. That&apos;s rich. There has been nothing but condescension from Hillary supporters from the beginning. Hate to clue you but you are not "left". Fracking, the death penalty, less than $15 per hour, itching for war, make your candidate RIGHT. "Pulling her to the left"? Talk is cheap. Hillary is a Republican.

Does Walsh get paid by the word?

Yes, Senator Sanders should say that he came under fire when he visited Wyoming. Or was it Nevada? 
The "Hillary Way"!

Learn from Hillary&apos;s 2008 lessons? OK, instead of saying Obama&apos;s qualifications were, "He gave a good speech," as Hillary did, I guess Bernie should point out that the only legislation Hillary got passed as Senator from NY were to name two buildings and get a monument funded.

I miss Christopher Hitchens...

Of course. The plummy accent, the condescending know-all attitude, the public-schoolboy rudeness, the anti-Clinton hysteria, Iraq war cheerleading, Islamophobia, anti-religious boilerplate. What’s not to miss?

You clearly have not read much of Hitchens&apos; work.  You might want to start with his "Unacknowledged Legislators," one of the finest collections of literary essays of our time by a man whose first love was clearly language (and it showed even in his casual utterances).  As for anti-Clinton hysteria, you seem to think there&apos;s something wrong with that, even when laboriously documented and never contradicted.  I believe there are libel laws in this country, and 14 years after his book, still not a peep from the rather mouthy Clintons, or their daughter.  He had spent a lot of time in the Middle East and knew many of its more eminent leftists and thinkers, and could not by any stretch be thought an antagonist to the Muslim world.  I never found him "rude" even when I disagreed with his position: he merely stated his opinions, and did not feel the cloying and disingenuous American need to apologize for them before even uttering them (e.g. see Joan Walsh&apos;s "I&apos;m not saying that Bernie Sanders is a sexist, but" approach. ) Putting the disinformation out almost half-heartedly--you find that sort of obfuscation appealing?
I suppose his critique of religion might have been a bit boilerplate, but he spoke of it well, and was fully willing to point out its weaknesses.  He is precisely the voice of clear thinking and writing that we could use at this "low, dishonest" moment.  Or, as he might have said, "fuck off."  That&apos;s one rather common way of asking your interlocutor to have a moment of seriousness in England or Ireland, and is rarely considered impolite.  It all depends upon the context.

The female Chris Matthews...

This piece is truly rant-worthy, but I&apos;ll resist and simply say that the editors of The Nation should have sent this back to the author with a note reading: "Sorry, JW, but we can&apos;t possibly run a piece on this subject that completely fails to acknowledge the strategic decision of the Clinton campaign to go hard negative in New York to &apos;disqualify and defeat&apos; Sanders. That wouldn&apos;t be responsible journalism, don&apos;t you agree?"

What I find so offensive about this thinly veiled hit-job masquerading as journalism, is that the author conveniently omits certain essential facts. When Bernie Sanders stated that Clinton was "not qualified to be president," Joan Walsh fails to note that Clinton had spent part of the prior day on MSNBC claiming, though her usual circumlocution, that Bernie is somehow not ready to be president. So, when one of the Clintons drags their opponent into the slime, as they always do, is the opponent supposed to stand still and take it? Speaking of 2008, Hillary at that time said Obama wasn&apos;t even qualified to be Vice President, because he lacked experience in foreign affairs. Another very tiresome trope is the one where we are supposed to be grateful to Sanders for dragging Clinton to the left. Well, if one prefers the left, why not vote for that candidate in the first place, instead of the one who mimics him at nearly every turn?

There&apos;s nothing ironic about Bernie Sanders wanting to get rid of the super delegate system, but also using it to his advantage while it is still the law, and still in place. To *not* use the system we have would be shortsighted and foolish.  For the record, I&apos;m one of those over-50 female Democrats who&apos;s supposed to be supporting Hillary, but I&apos;m supporting Bernie, and have been since he announced his candidacy — as are most of my over-50 female Democratic friends.

Can I assume you feel the same way about super-pacs?

Joan Walsh is talking in circles to find arguments to dismiss Bernie. What Bernie said is that Clinton isn&apos;t qualified as president because she takes special interests money and is beholden to them, not the people. And that she isn&apos;t qualified because she voted for the Iraq war, a war crime that was preventable: everybody knew that Saddam didn&apos;t have any weapons of mass destruction: the first gulf war and the ensuing sanctions were designed to decimate and impoverish Iraq to make invasion easier. The Iraq war clearly was planned a long time in advance and the WMD&apos;s were a cheap pretext, invented to justify unprovoked aggression to establish a second wing to attack Iran. That didn&apos;t work and the Iraq war and the country turned into a failure. Clinton new that when she voted for the war. What Bernie made clear is that a candidate who voted for that war - i.e. for hegemony wars and world domination at the cost of millions killed, isn&apos;t qualified to lead the USA. And he is so right. There is no way how Walsh can talk her way around that.

As to Bernie pushing the women away: not really. There are a good number of women who support Clinton in a false believe that she will make life better for them. That is an illusion. Clinton spoke in Afghanistan for women&apos;s education, but it was only talk. Afghan women were incomparably more equal to their male counterparts under the Soviet occupation than they are under the American occupation. So what did she really accomplish? Talk isn&apos;t action and it isn&apos;t effect. Those women who are for genuine government - they are with Bernie.

Vote for Bernie. Bernie for 2016

As to the super delegates and Bernie wanting to negotiate at a possible open convention: yes, that is justified. Many of the caucuses and primaries were closed primaries - i.e. only registered democrats could vote. That deprived Bernie of a good portion of his independent voters and it makes the contest really unfair because no longer all the people&apos;s will. In addition it is also true that so many super delegates support Clinton because they expect favors in return and know they will get them, whereas Bernie does not believe in such favoritism. So they don&apos;t support him. Again, there is every reason for a review if pledged delegates and votes received by the two candidates are close together.

As to Clinton&apos;s credibility as woman and politician: no there isn&apos;t any. In 2008 Clinton complained bitterly about Obama&apos;s attacks on her position for universal health care. Now that she gets her campaign financing form the very insurance companies that benefit from Obamacare, she condescends on Bernie for universal health care. And she isn&apos;t beholden to special interests? But who believes that? As to universal health care: financially, it is the only way that makes sense, because least expensive, apt to lower hospital costs and payments by employees and employers alike as the tax required to pay for it is less than the policy costs now. Clinton has no genuine argument against it - which again means: she caters to special interests. And no, a candidate who forfeits the better way for special interests is not qualified for president.

The author seems to forget that Mrs. Clinton started the "non-qualified" nonsense.  Mr. Sanders reacted by saying that if she felt like that, he wasn&apos;t going to take it lying down, but would push back.  That is a reasonable state of mind.  The Clintons both have a way of making snarky comments about competitors when they are feeling scared as they should be since Mr. Sanders has won six of the last seven contests.  It does the press no service when commentators react to his comments but not to her previous one.

I must chime in on both Hillary&apos;s and Joan&apos;s "Bernie is not a Democrat" garbage. Of course he&apos;s not! There is no party to the left of the Democrats, especially since Bill C moved it so far to the right I&apos;ve felt completely abandoned since then. If the Dem party were the FDR party or even the republican Teddy Roosevelt party, Bernie would have some colleagues to talk to. He was very smart to run as a Democrat because he would not have received any coverage by the media otherwise. Finally, now the Democratic party can take a very good look at all the people they have left out over the years. May he re-shape the party forever. Bernie throws the long balls because he knows that when negotiation comes to the fore he can move back a bit and actually accomplish something-----not all these baby incremental steps that accomplish nothing.

Why is Joan Walsh still on the payroll?

&apos;Too many Sanders supporters—including, I would say, Jeff Weaver—seem not to be similarly respectful of the front-running candidacy of the potential first woman president&apos; - 

What is this supposed to mean? Her self-worth is somehow raised because she has the potential to break a milestone or the status quo as first female president? Why should the Bernie camp compromise anything for that?

Just saw a report on All In on MSNBC on how thoroughly Clinton trashed Obama in 2008.  I think Sanders taking her bait was a mistake for his own self interest, but does there come a time when an elite establishment figure in it for herself doesn&apos;t deserve our respect?

Ani has some wise words here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSpdDSLyZJE

"﻿ ...I’m happy he’s running inside the party, not undermining it like Ralph Nader did in 2000."
Please put this sentiment in the garbage where it belongs. Al Gore lost it, all by his milquetoast self.

I have no problem with any candidate&apos;s ambition, unless their ambition leads them to unethical and/or illegal behaviors.  There are valid reasons so many are concerned about Hillary&apos;s email scandal and the appearances of unethical dealings at The Clinton Family Foundation.  Those may end up being clear (and true) examples of "destructive" ambition.  We shall see.

I see you are still pumping those pompons for the war-monger Joan!

Hillary is certainly qualified to be ANOTHER Corporatist President ... she certainly doesn&apos;t represent real change for the working class with her "incremental change" nonsense ... it just a new way to say more Clintonesque triangulation is on its way!  And no one who practices CHENEY-like foreign policy is qualified to be POTUS.

.The piece is long on the unhelpful/misleading/misrepresenting things the Sanders campaign has said about Clinton.  How about the other side of it?  How about her recent campaign to show that she stands with Pres. Obama while he doesn&apos;t?   Then she says, at other times, how she is committed to "reaffirming our unshakeable bond" with Benjamin Netanyahu.  Excuse me?  Is there a world leader who is ostensibly our ally, and a recipient of our foreign aid (and in Israel&apos;s case, so much more) who has behaved in a more disgraceful and insulting fashion toward Barack Obama?  (The anti-Iran deal address to the Republicans in Congress, etc.)  I could go on.

Joan Walsh should keep writing, but not like this.

And NOT for The Nation.

Brava, Joan,  Brava!

Forget about your FEELINGS and look at what the climate change crisis is doing to the world.  (Study it if you don&apos;t understand tnat it is a crisis.)  Hillary obvioisly does not understand it, no matter what she says now.  Look at how much death and destruction have come from Hillary&apos;s past votes.  Bernie refuses to blame her, but I think everyone who voted for war when I knew (just from what I learned from paying attention to the media) the Iraq invasion was totally wrong and against international law.  From what I have learned recently, I see that Hillary&apos;s first reaction to "scary" people is fear, rejection, and a desire for protection.  Bernie&apos;s first reaction, I think, is not fear, but to try to understand what hurt the people, making them strike out.  This is what I think we need in a president when our country is faced with the climate change crisis, terrorists mostly abroad, and a growing oligarchy here and over the whole world.  I want a leader who will first care about all the people and then search the real world situation for causes and solutions.  I don&apos;t want fear or a love of wealth to get in the way, as both very well can.

I agree Amalie and Hillary didn&apos;t learn a damn thing from her mistakes on Iraq. She and O&apos;Bummer plunged straight ahead into Libya and screwed it up bad. Also I have a problem with Hillary being seen as a champion for women. Maybe in the US but then there is Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala where she supported adictatorships slaughter and torture of women and children. She even supported the overthrow of democratically elected social democrat Celaya in favor of a dictator in Nicaragua.

You&apos;re right about "climate change" and so was Bernie when the 5 Democrats in the race were asked "what is the most critical issue facing  the US"? If you want the truth about it, read Naomi Klein&apos;s book or see the movie "This Changes Everything; Capitalism vs. Climate". The young people get this. They also realize "The Status Quo; has got to GO"!

I think Bernie is the only candidate on both sides of the aisle who understands that terrorism is an artificial US caused problem that has to be stopped so the way more real and dangerous problem, which is climate change, can be dealt with.

Well, Joan, I find your comments somewhat offensive... and very condescending.  Like pretending to be the adult in the room.  As if Hillary becoming the first woman president is a reason to vote for her??? Then let&apos;s resurrect Carly!!!  That is ridiculous.  Whether of not Bernie wins the nomination, and whether or not the pundits think he has a chance is not the point.  The single biggest problem with American democracy is campaign finance corruption and money in politics.  Joan, I hope you&apos;ve read Jane Mayer&apos;s "Dark Money"!!!  And on this score, Hillary fails.  Why?  For the same reason many Bernie supporters, including me, will find it hard to vote for her.  Hillary is a corportist!!!!! Pure and simple.  Bernie is not.  Bill and Hillary have been neck deep in corporatism from the get go.  Hillary depends on corporate and Wall Street money to fund her campaign.... Bernie does not.  And the claim that Hillary supporters make that she can take corporate money and not be beholding to them is totally ridiculous.  If you&apos;ve read "Dark Money", you cannot help but realize that the 1%ers have had a plan to annex American democracy since Reagan was president.  Taking their money inevitably means you are in bed with them.  You are mistaken Joan, if you think Hillary can just ignore this.

Exactly!!! The problem with Hillary Clinton is not that she is a woman. Would Elizabeth Warren been the candidate you would see how feminist the Bernie supporters are.

Hillary has no intention to ignore the call and obligation of big money - she has catered to big money and power time and again. See:
http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/01/30/clinton-system-donor-machine-2016-election/

Joan, your points and facts are obvious, but you&apos;re addressing a crowd that only wants to hear what they want to.  I get the feeling that some of these people would vote for Alger Hiss over Clinton, and I say that only half-kiddingly.

Clinton is eminently qualified to be President of a Corporate America. Bernie is the only candidate qualified to be President of an America that treats Main Street and peace in the world as its primary focus, not Wall Street and the military and prison industrial complexes. All the pundits think in tears of  meritocracy not class consciousness and class loyalty. Clinton&apos;s loyalty is to the upper class and to gaining more millions for herself.  Bernie&apos;s loyalty is to working people, the middle class and poor folks, he has never used politics to enrich himself, aka taking contributions from Wall Street, oil, big pharma etc.  Yes, one needs to be intelligent and understand the world and both qualify.  The most important qualification, to quote an old Union slogan, is "Which side are you on?"  And folks there is only one candidate that qualifies for being 100% on the side of the vast majority of the people v.  Wall Street and big corporations. Bernie Sanders!!
And once you understand this there is nothing else to consider. Vote Bernie or get one of the four other corporate America first candidates.  This is why Bernie gets treated so badly by all the establishment media, pundits and even the establishment non- profits, Congressional Black Caucus PAC with multiple corporate lobbiest on their BOD, and the Black establishment. The same Black Establishment that disavowed MLK Jr.&apos;s stepping out of the racial justice box by adding stop the Viet Nam war and economic justice to his campaign. "Killer Mike" has said it many times, he supports Bernie since he is the only candidate who continues King&apos;s multiple issues agenda for justice.

I agree with you. What is really the problem is precisely: money and favors. It is the reason why Sanders has so few super delegates or black leaders/mayors/governors etc. supporting him: with Hillary they know that their endorsement will be acknowledged with some benefits, monetary or political pecking order wise. With Sanders they know that no tangible benefit will come their way unless they merit it based on their own actions and policies. And they don&apos;t trust their policies since most of these leaders in the south really chose politics as a way to enrich themselves.

Trump has the same problem: the establishment realizes that they cannot control him, that he isn&apos;t dependent on special interest money and they fear the loss of their "income" from it. Hence Trump and Bernie must be ousted. They are a danger to the cosy status quo in Washington.

The Democratic establishment will lose young voters if it continues negotiating for crumbs instead of demanding real progress. Our democracy works only if citizens stay engaged with their political representatives between elections. No matter who becomes president, our country&apos;s future depends on us.

JOAN if you want Sanders to act like Hillary he will have to to go into rural areas and promote guns as Hillary did in 2008 when running again Obama yes Hillary did this so much that Obama called "ANNIE OAKLEY" Joan how can you support such a dishonest person who now attacks Sanders on guns, is there anything she will not say yo gain power , Sabers says we, him and his people , Hillary says I I I or me me me, Joan please think, you are too honest to support Hillary

And Hillary just took money from the Gun Lobby. Bernie would kick them out of the temple.

From her own tweet, Clinton admits to developing a new campaign strategy after WI elections to attack Sander&apos;s presidential competency. Today, NYT&apos;s top story says:
"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Turn to Attacks on Credentials
By AMY CHOZICK and YAMICHE ALCINDOR
In a change in tenor that may indicate difficulty in unifying Democrats, Mr. Sanders said Mrs. Clinton was unqualified to be president."

From this and other coverage, it&apos;s safe to bet NYT and other mainstream media have been bought.

NYT coverage has been bought a long time ago. Recently they had an article which turned to be an advertisement likely written by the Clinton campaign or Clinton herself. CNN, as someone pointed out is owned by Times Warner, a company that donated heavily to the Clinton campaign. So how could these media not be bought? They didn&apos;t need to buy them, they own them.

I&apos;m not a political junky and find the process boring as hell, but as any fool can see the Democratic Party is now the New Democratic Party.  Sanders is the real flag bearer of what the Clinton-Obama crowd falsely claim to represent. It&apos;s been that way for a long time. And a lot of us are sick to death of it, a whole lot of us.

You&apos;re on the right track, but I don&apos;t think we have a democratic party anymore. Ex-President Jimmy Carter got it right when he said "we now have an Oligarchy"! Sanders is the real Democrat representing what the Party used to stand for. I&apos;m 92 years old and know what they used to stand for.

Joan Walsh is joined at the hip with Hillary Clinton like a Siamese twin. It&apos;s rather disappointing from a public intellectual at a premier journal with a rich history of progressivism in politics. Walsh is just too emotionally invested in Clinton as many of the professional women in the party of a certain age are about Clinton of which Walsh is clearly representative. And I&apos;m getting quite bored about Walsh&apos;s trope week after week in her columns about how Sanders&apos; operatives are engaging in in mansplaining to ardent Clintonistas that Sanders is the more qualified to lead the Democratic Party. Even though I voted for Sanders in the Ohio primary, I knew Clinton would win. And she&apos;ll obviously be the nominee for the party, because Clinton has the super delegate count locked up for her candidacy. So despite all these pleas from Sanders&apos; operatives to super delegates who are pledged to Clinton now for them to keep an open mind at the convention about him. Clinton will win the race and the election. But she has lost the trust and support of Democrats on the far left in the party in a schism within in the party. But Walsh still seems so worried Sanders just may convince more super delegates to vote for him and just may pull it off. He won&apos;t. It&apos;s almost that if Clinton would somehow lose the race in the party, it would also be a personal defeat for Walsh. At least, that&apos;s how Walsh come across to me from reading her weekly columns.

Unfortunately, there is not much hope that Bernie will convince more super delegates to vote for him: these super delegates are almost exclusively people who stand to gain monetarily and status wise from Clinton if she is elected while Sanders doesn&apos;t meet out money gifts. If there is anything that proves Clinton&apos;s faithfulness to special interests it is just that: the super delegates!

Where to start with these embarrassingly obtuse musings?  This article focuses on 90s style "identity politics" which did wonders for minorities, the poor, and the working class in terms of their incomes, chances of incarceration, drug addiction, suicide, odds of becoming a war casualty/amputee/corpse, and so many of the other gifts Clintonian triangulation/pro-corporate policies brought us as footnotes to our enslavement--I suppose my first question is why is it in the Nation, when it could help Trump more by being in the Times, who also support the false Clinton or Trump dichotomy?  I suppose Maya Angelou might be asked to read at the Inauguration should Clinton somehow triumph against her own hawkish and corporatist record, and that would be significant to the people who find such things significant.
A reader quoted the late Ted Kennedy earlier, when he remarked that "the last thing this country needs is a second Republican party."  Hillary is winning in that second Republican party primary, but Bernie is clearly winning with the liberals (as opposed to the neo-liberals)--the people who used to be called Democrats, but most likely will not be called so after this election, unless the party abandons "neoliberalism" and its corrupt Clintonian apparatchiks.

I wasn&apos;t sure if it was a smart thing to suggest that Hillary was "unqualified", but on second thought it should be remembered that most people agree that "our political system is broken"! Who broke it? Our government representatives that have been bought and paid for by the Corporations. Hillary says the millions she&apos;s gotten won&apos;t influence her decisions. Duh!

It&apos;s just part of the vilification campaign Hillary has gotten into that because Bernie used the word "not qualified" that he is now the villain but Hillary who acted condescendingly against Bernie&apos;s issues and that he didn&apos;t know what he was talking about and that he couldn&apos;t get that through Congress, doesn&apos;t get any criticism. Meanwhile just as Jane Sanders pointed out,Berniealways qualified how he considers Hillary not qualified - because of her bad decisions and her obligations to big money interests. Which makes this "not qualified" really just another way of saying what he always said - that you can&apos;t be beholden to the people if you take money from the big banks and corporations. The MSM - bought and paid for by the Clinton machine - is just omitting that. Which makes their drivel more of the usual pandering to Clinton.

Hillary was gaslighting Bernie and corporate media readers. Did you see the interview Jane Sanders gave Maddow on the subject?

I was really impressed with Jane Sanders after that interview with Rachel. Wow what a lady, really bright, dedicated and articulate.

From the headline, I thought I might agree with Walsh for about the first time ever.  I think Sanders took the Clinton bait and overreacted in a way that harmed no one but himself.  And Jeff Weaver has made a mistake turning this campaign into politics as usual.

But as usual, Walsh framed the issue completely disingenuously and dishonestly.  She&apos;s so blind, any response is pointless.

There was no mention of the uneven playing field and quasi secret power brokerage behind the Democratic presidential campaign,  nor of the near total eclipse of media coverage of Bernie Sanders&apos; far larger (and more polite) crowds.   Debbie Wasserman Whatshername write this piece, and sign the name Joan Walsh to it?

You&apos;ve taken Sanders&apos; comment that Clinton is not qualified to be president out of context.   She condescendingly accused him of not knowing what he is talking about in regards to breaking up the big banks in response to a question about whether he is qualified to be president.   He shot back that she is unqualified to be president because of special interest money that she has raised and that has been raised on her behalf.  

Neither Sanders&apos; nor Weaver&apos;s comments has anything to do with Clinton&apos;s gender.   Imagine if Sanders&apos; opponent was Elizabeth Warren, and that she, like Sanders, was running a people funded and powered campaign.  It&apos;s hard to imagine, because he wouldn&apos;t be running if Warren was the alternative.  He&apos;d be cheering her on and campaigning for her.  

On the other hand,    It is a fact that Hillary Clinton relies heavily on big money.   More importantly,  as Naomi Klein elaborated on in her most recent article, Clinton has a thoroughly corporatist world view that prevents her from understanding that enacting progressive economic policy necessarily means that the wealthiest and most powerful among us be pressured to let go of some degree of wealth and power.  

 It is also a fact that Hillary Clinton very much wants to be president, and in her quest to achieve this goal, is characterizing as pie in the sky juvenile fantasies: universal health care, a $15 hour minimum wage, across the board aggressive climate action,  immigration reform that doesn&apos;t allow for de facto slavery,  and  getting the corrupting influence of big money out of politics.

Unfortunately for Bernie, 2016 will not present a choice between two equivalent candidates who both can be trusted to preserve, protect and defend the basic human and civil rights which are the the United States&apos; reason for being.  Bernie&apos;s campaign would be just the first step in a probably multi-decade process of assembling popular, legislative and executive support for taking the country in a new, progressive-style direction. Notwithstanding his lifelong optimism, and that of his inexperienced young supporters, this is not a year conducive to starting out on such an adventure that is so different from anything that has gained any traction at all in our history.  Bernie is also a Jew, and many parts of the U.S. will not vote for a Jewish president. The Republican candidates all present an immediate danger to our basic rights, democratic institutions and civil order.  As flawed as Hillary is, she is electable and can be trusted to not take the country down a vortex of chaos and disintegration. She can also be trusted to defend our rights and institutions against the as-yet uncountable number of armed, resentful crazies whom the Republicans have been nurturing for decades whom none of their new front-men can necessarily control.  In these circumstances Hillary is arguably not our best choice. She is our only reliable choice.

Frankly Richard, there has not been a "United" states for many years.. (read: American Nations; a History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America" by Colin Woodard).  Concurrently, there has been an attempt on a number of fronts, Congressional, Judicial and on the State level for the 1%/John Birch crowd to appropriate American democracy for it&apos;s own enrichment (again, "Dark Money" by Jane Mayer).  I sincerely doubt Ms. Clinton is willing to challenge this power structure, because she believe in it, at least to a degree.  This why Bernie is popular.  But I&apos;d like to suggest something radical: offer the republican/conservative/racist/evangleical 20% of the voters a chance and a path for their secession!!! I know they wouldn&apos;t take it, but even the offer would put this whole debate in a new light.  Do the corporations REALLY want to be in bed with this crowd?  They are about making money, not fighting social issues.  When you start looking at it from this perspective, Hillary&apos;s hypocrisy becomes evident.

Unfortunately, you are probably not wrong about the Jewish thing (not to mention that he doesn&apos;t pretend to be a person of faith thing). Any shred of actual evidence notwithstanding, I think that being an atheist (or whatever he is) New York Jew has cost him quite a bit of potential support in the Democratic primaries in the south.  

I&apos;m not sure though that this problem would translate to a general election.   Which states would  candidate Sanders lose that Obama won in 2012 based on these calculations?

I suggest Joan Walsh should read Diana Johnstone&apos;s magnum opus, Queen of Chaos. There she&apos;ll find the sordid truth about HRC. Inter alia, she was among the prime architects of the Libyan War, the fiasco in Syria, and the right- wing coup in Honduras, which ultimately resulted in the mafia- style execution slaying of Berta Caceres.  HRC is a dangerous neoliberal warmonger and a menace to the world.

I am in support of an open convention for Bernie. My support stems from knowing that there have been voter suppression and disenfranchisement efforts in several States so far. It is my strong view that the pledged-delegate numbers would be much closer between the two candidates were in not for the aforementioned travesty that exists in our "democratic" system. Furthermore, data has existed that show Independents are overwhelmingly supporting Bernie, however those Independent-voter numbers would be much larger, and would have also contributed to the narrowing of the delegate-count if it were not for the few closed "Primaries" in several States as well. An open convention would help to rectify these obstacles that have attempted to keep Bernie from succeeding earlier.

Joan thank you for recognizing that a 2016 reconciliation will not duplicate 2008 given the ideological split between Sanders and Clinton.   Please take your analysis a step further in noting that Sanders supporters are fundamentally different than the standard democrat and this fuels the Bernie or Bust movement.  Sanders voters are driven by fairness and ethics, so it&apos;s not just a policy split with Clinton, it&apos;s a loathing of her Machiavellian approach.  Unlike dems Bust see corporatists and the oligarchy as the enemy not the GOP.  They do not sign the Clinton contract agreeing to vote against economic self-interest and ignore war in exchange for social issues, identity politics and the Supreme Court.  Their priorities are economic fairness, ending oligarchy control of economics and politics, peace and climate change, issues Clinton would prefer that voters ignore.  Final issue is time, Bust is willing to sacrifice the next four years for eight years of a true progressive as president.  Add all those up, imo Bust is not returning to the party, they will leave it behind.

Hillary&apos;s getting a taste of Machiavellian Democracy. That is the WHY of her not having sewn up the nomination. And she will NOT win the nomination... because Machiavellian Democracy is real and alive.

I recommend interested readers Google it.

Thanks, Tom, but I think the women in our world will make up for your absence, more than make up for it actually.

Not this woman, who has voted with the party since 1968, but no more. I can&apos;t vote for what I can&apos;t believe in or trust. Reading this article affirmed that conclusion.

Sanders won women under 30 by 84% to 14% in Iowa.  He won women under 45 with 69% support in New Hampshire.  I&apos;m guessing he has strong numbers with young women in most states. 

His deficits have come not from women voters, but with older voters, wealthier voters, and black voters who are a subset of more conservative voters.   So, a wealthy older, black voter, would be extremely unlikely to vote Sanders, regardless of gender (unless that voter happens to be a celebrity like Killer Mike!).   A wealthy older white voter would be some somewhat more likely to vote Sanders, and likelier still if that voter held very liberal political views. 

But, a women, under 40, of any race, with very liberal politics would be very likely to vote for Sanders.   Even a women over 40 with very liberal political views would be likely to vote Sanders.  Sanders won 83% of all women voters in very liberal Vermont, only slightly behind his 91% showing with men and even won 77% of voters over age 65 there, suggesting he won a large majority of women voters over age 65.  Why?  Because, while age and gender did have some predictive effect on voting here, political ideology had a much much greater effect, and it just so happens that unlike most other places, there are a lot of very liberal older women voters in Vermont.

Actually, I think the reason Bernie did so well in Vermont is that Vermonters, who know him the best, love Bernie. Even Republicans in Vermont love him. It is just so much harder to get the message out on a national scale, especially when the corporate news media are making such a concerted effort to discredit him.

I won&apos;t be absent Jay, just voting 3rd party if Clinton is the nominee.  As for women, they hold the election in their hands.  However what you are apparently banking on is millennial women.   They are the most principled of the Bust movement, they deplore her lack of ethics.   They also see a bleak corporatist future for them, nothing done about climate change, and they refuse to vote for her.  Millenial women going to Democracy Spring, planning to march on the DNC, actively engaged in Bernie or Bust.  They aren&apos;t going to vote for Clinton due to mutual plumbing, they can&apos;t stand her.  Clinton keeps assuming they can be brought back, she keeps assuming Bust are regular democrats motivated by GOP fear.  The reason they are Bust is the traditional democrat arguments don&apos;t work on them.  Or they wouldn&apos;t be Bust.  Simple and obvious but some people believe if they wish hard enough or cite history while ignoring motivations Bust, millenials and independents will vote for her in November.  Won&apos;t happen.  They won&apos;t even be democrats in November.

I just hope those millennial women don&apos;t run out of coat hangers if the GOP re-takes the Supreme Court.  They&apos;re going to need them.

Joan: “Too many Sanders supporters—including, I would say, Jeff Weaver—seem not to be similarly respectful of the front-running candidacy of the potential first woman president. […] There is also Weaver’s early salvo in the gender war between the two candidates, when he suggested Sanders would consider Clinton as his vice president. “Look, she’d make a great vice president,” he told Bloomberg in October. “We’re willing to give her more credit than Obama did. We’re willing to consider her for vice president. We’ll give her serious consideration. We’ll even interview her.” 
They’ll even interview the front-runner. That was a magic moment.” Sure but I think it would be appropriate to mention at this point that the Clinton campaign in 08 made the same suggestion vis a vis Obama. And it was even later in the game, in March of the election year rather than the previous October. Obama’s response was one of his magic moments back then. He said, “With all due respect, I’ve won twice as many states as Sen Clinton. I’ve won more of the popular vote than Sen Clinton. I have more delegates than Sen Clinton. So, I don’t know how somebody who’s in second place, is offering the vice presidency to the person who’s in first place. I mean I’m just wondering cuz if I was in second place I could understand it, but I’m in first place right now.” It’s on the Youtube under “Obama: Hillary trying to bamboozle you with VP talk,” showing a young and bodacious Barack talking to supporters and adding a second reason why the suggestion didn’t make any sense.

Sorry, I don&apos;t buy any of this.
I think health care should be universal. I would like to see the perpetual Middle East war stop. I think we should invest in schools, universities, and roadways. I think big money does not belong in politics, as it corrupts our democracy- which is flailing anyway due to gerrymandering, superdelegates, the electoral college, and (among others) DWS. I don&apos;t see HRC doing anything about any of these issues. I don&apos;t understand why anyone would accept six digits for making a speech or several to a leading financial institution- and then not be proud enough of what you said to broadcast it to the world.
So, I will continue to support Bernie as long as there is a path to victory- and there is. Sure, HRC won a lot of states, but any assertion that you can read the tea leaves has been rendered inert by this entire election.
I expect candidates to spar, and one of the most lamentable products of this election has been the media&apos;s focus on these relatively minor spats- and not how the aforementioned issues actually resonate with all Americans.

Its the war, stupid.

HRC has never met a war or a weapons merchant she didn&apos;t like. Her much vaunted "experience" consists of a string of spectacular blunders from Honduras to Libya to Syria and beyond, and (by her own words) her interventionism is not going to stop there if elected. She&apos;s clearly spoiling for a fight with Putin and the Russians. God help us if she continues the provocative policy of surrounding the Russian homeland with right wing thugs like the current Ukranian apparatchik...at the same time everyone is "modernizing" their nuclear arms fleets with tactical battlefield nukes.

Identity voters burn just as well as everyone else in a nuclear fireball.

The Bern campaign is embarrassing itself. I could care less whether he stays in or not. He&apos;s going to get clobbered in NY and PA where he has to appeal to someone besides his unquestioning social media devotees of white, elitist bros. The comments on Sandy Hook, the Daily News article, and the sexist remarks about HRC have forever tarnished Bernie. He was once a great progressive warrior and I loved him at one time but he&apos;s become Trump at this point. Anyone that continues to support him is not a progressive. Plain and simple.

I&apos;m confused.  Why would elitist white Bros support Sanders?  They&apos;re the ones who would be hurt the most by his policies.  I&apos;d say that Sanders supporters of all stripes are the people who care most passionately about economic and racial injustice, about war and the environment, and believe that this is our last chance to take on the establishment and win.

Karen, have you never heard of Machiavellian Democracy? Google it. Hillary&apos;s toast.

I haven&apos;t.  I will.  Hope so.

This analysis is not supported by facts, and is viscous in tone. 

Sanders version 2016 is virtually no different than Sanders version 1980-2015.  He&apos;s always been a fiery voice in the wilderness calling for common sense progressive change in a sea of bought and paid for politicians.   The only thing that has changed is that tens of millions of people are listening and this has the Democratic party scared and mobilized to defame and destroy.

Where are you getting "tens of millions" of people? He isn&apos;t even beating Ted Cruz in popular votes and he&apos;s getting clobbered by Hillary in that count. She is the choice of the People, not him. Continuing to lie and say he has more support or enthusiasm than him is mendacious and downright sexist. If he beats her, he beats her. But he&apos;s not beating her now and if you Bern Bros can&apos;t admit that, I don&apos;t know what else to tell you, I honestly don&apos;t. Criticizing her for being ambitious and fracturing the party she has worked to help for 40 years when she is the FRONTRUNNER is beyond frustrating. So just stop with the vague rhetoric about momentum and a movement and accept the facts (math) that shows her winning big.

Roberta, I didn&apos;t claim he was beating her or that he had tens of millions of votes.  For the record, I think it is exceedingly unlikely that he will win the nomination at this point.  What I said is that the message he is broadcasting is virtually identical to the the one he has been broadcasting for the last 35 years--only now tens of millions people are listening.  My evidence that the message is the same; go back and watch any speech he gave as mayor of Burlington on the House or Senate floor, or anywhere else until this campaign started.  Then watch the speeches he&apos;s giving now.  It&apos;s the same speech that focusses on income inequality, the rising specter of oligarchy, and the moral outrage of not taking care of the most vulnerable and abused members of our society.   My evidence that tens of millions of people are listening:  The campaign has collected donations from around 2 million individuals, which is by far a record.   Over 7 million people have cast votes for him with many contests with large amounts of voters still to come.  Were he to make it to the general (which he probably won&apos;t) It is likely he would capture many tens of millions of votes.   My point isn&apos;t that he is likely to win.  He was never likely to win the primary (though he would be far more likely to win the general than the primary).  What he has done is broadcast a message that shifts the parameters of what it is kosher to talk about it in mainstream American politics.  To say that tens of millions of people are listening is not to say that he will win. It&apos;s to say that this is a major achievement that has the Democratic party worried and therefore willing to defame and destroy Sanders.   Why?  Because for the first time in modern American political history, a major candidate has openly and aggressively challenged the insidious relationship between politicians and their wealthy and powerful donors.   What really puzzles me is why anybody who is more or less sympathetic to Sanders&apos; message is feeling and expressing so much vitriol towards him now.

Great response! Almost everyone knows that our political system is broken; and why. And Bernie is the only candidate of the original 22 for both parties that doesn&apos;t have a super-pac! You can visualize the strings attached to the puppets and the "fat cats" behind the curtains pulling them.

To add to this, to throw in the towel now would be to throw away all these gains.  He needs to keep the pressure on, keep broadcasting the message in the populous states still to come, and not agree to support Clinton, tacitly or otherwise, until she promises (and keeps her promise) to campaign aggressively for at minimum  four things:  1) True publicly financed universal health care  2) True aggressive and drastic  across the board climate action. (including banning fracking, the construction of tar sands pipelines, an appropriate carbon tax, and massive public investment in renewables and public transit 3) Meaningful and aggressive reform of the banking and financial sector.  4) A pledge to back a national $15 minimum wage by 2020.   It would be nice to get some changes to her foreign policy outlook as well--specifically a pledge to not engage in or support any regime change/ building/ interventions and coups.   If she became THAT candidate, I would gladly support her.

Where are  your facts? She has millions more votes than he does, more pledged delegates and she has won more states. So how in the world does he have the right to claim he is the new leader of a "new" Democratic party? If he gets more votes, he should be the nominee, if not, he shouldn&apos;t. Plain and simple. But at this point, there is virtually no chance he overtakes her in either pledged delegates or popular vote. So the argument that he should be the nominee must be premised on flipping superdelegates or convincing the party through back room deals to defy the will of the people and nominate him? Because why? I truly don&apos;t get what tangible argument you have to crown him the nominee. 

If Bernie would just plainly state that unless he wins the pledged delegates and/or the popular vote, he won&apos;t seek the nomination through superdelegates, I will back off and let the process play out. Otherwise, he is being hypocritical at best and sexist/entitled at worst.

And on the Daily News issue, those are facts. The fact is that he can&apos;t explain a centerpiece of his platform. He hasn&apos;t does his homework. Dodd Frank does provide the mechanisms to break up big banks. But Bernie apparently didn&apos;t think it was worth his time to figure that out. 

And on Sandy Hook, how can so-called progressives continue to sit by and apologize for his pro-gun and pro-corporation view on this issue? The victims of mass shootings should be allowed to sue gun manufacturers. That would create a powerful incentive for them to stop manufacturing high-magazine guns that are capable of such atrocities.

In the interview you cite he actually said that Dodd Frank could give this authority. 

Here is what he said: 

"How you go about doing it is having legislation passed, or giving the authority to the secretary of treasury to determine, under Dodd-Frank, that these banks are a danger to the economy over the problem of too-big-to-fail."  

As far as Sandy Hook goes,  I guess we (and others) have an honest disagreement on how to deal with the problem of gun violence.   I&apos;m not getting why a victim should be able to sue a gun manufacturer for making a legal product that was not defective.  Wouldn&apos;t it make more sense to just outlaw that product?  

As far as the convention goes: It&apos;s a campaign and they are in it to the end.   What they are trying to do is persuade voters that there is still a reason to vote for them--despite the slim odds--and, they are trying to get us much leverage as possible moving into the convention to push Clinton on key issues-- health care, climate change, money in politics, minimum wage.  They want to put as much pressure as they can on Clinton to move further towards Sanders&apos; positions on these issues before (and if) they are to throw their full support behind her.  Seems like a good ideas to me.

It&apos;s about time that someone at the Nation called Bernie to task for his non-sensical claims about the Democratic Party and his delusions about taking it farther to the left on his free-token-ride to the White House.  He and others may disparage the neoliberals  as sell-outs to the interests of corporate America, but I would rather have Hillary Clinton deciding the political and economic future for this country than a befuddled and angry old man who sounds more each day like a Trump wannabe.

We expect that you will be the first in line to send your children or grandchildren to fight Hillary&apos;s wars.

What a sad situation that as fine a person as Joan is she is supporting the most dishonest candidate since Nixon. I believe if you take a hard  look at Hillary there is only one conclusion she i s corrupt to her core, it iOS who she is, example, one of many too much to list, in 2008 Hillary went to ruural area and strongly spoke her support for guns in general, "I will never let them take you gins away", remember Obama calling Hillary ANNIE OAKLEY, this is not a laughing matter, Hillary the duplicitous one and only.

I am a 64 year old socialist, former Union organizer, who has voted for Democrats holding my nose.   Clinton is not a progressive, never has been.  She&apos;s triangulating Sanders and will return to her centrist crypto-republicanism if elected.

The neo-liberals running the Democratic party stopped representing the majority of America long ago.  Kudos and scraps at election time, cold water and back hand after election.

I don&apos;t know what is sadder, working people&apos;s support of Trump or Democrats who don&apos;t understand the neo-liberalism is not the liberalism of the new deal.

At least with Republicans you know what your in for, with the Clintons... who knows.

Same here! Except for the Greens (Ralph Nader) when the Democrat was safe in WA. But after Vietnam I&apos;ve supported Third Party movements.

Neo-liberalism, according to the definitions I am reading, is distinguished by the privatization of traditional government functions and a rollback of government regulation of private business.  I&apos;m not aware of current Clinton policies that fit.  What I do believe Clinton represents is a familiarity with the problems of governing a large and diverse nation like the USA.   Not an easy or simple task, and not necessarily a task for, on the one hand, the pure of heart, or on the other, those who subscribe to paths of progress like socialism, which ultimately involve a degree of coercion against private property owners who may not consent to giving up anything they own. And if I don&apos;t exactly trust Bernie to be adept at or comfortable with the kind of horse-trading that is needed to govern effectively here, I definitely have no confidence in the willingness of the mass of his millennial fans to accept the need to work with and obtain the consent of the governed to achieve their goals.

OMG... Hillary is a liar and I don&apos;t trust her as far as I could throw her! Listen, if you aren&apos;t afraid to, go to You Tube and check out your hero&apos;s LIES! Right before your eyes... I know, she&apos;s not a flip flopper or any of the other horrible things she&apos;s accused of! Poor Hillary cares only about Hillary!

Bernie is known as the "Amendment King" which is the chief means he uses to get his policies passed.  He has a lot of experience working across the aisle to get things done, including working with John McCain on vet issues.
Most people in this country like socialist ideas whether they call them that or not - Social Security, Medicare, public education, public libraries, etc.  Socialist nations in Europe provide high standards of living for their people, as well  as high quality of life.

That&apos;s the point I like to make to people that have been "brainwashed" to fear socialism. It was President Bill Clinton that talked the DNC into getting in bed with the Corporations for campaign financing. The Dems could have tried for public funding of campaigns, but couldn&apos;t bring themselves to giving up the BIG donations from the BIG Corporations and the rich. So we have gradually turned the US into an Oligarchy! Bernie and Kucinich have probably been the only real Democrats running for the nomination for the last 30 years!

Hillary claims she knows how to get things done, but it will have to be "incrementally". Bernie understands that there is no time for incrementalism and so do the young people that will inherit the mess humanity has made. Ralph Nader has been trying to warn us about Corporations for years, but we didn&apos;t listen and we are faced with what may be our "last, best hope". Bernie&apos;s "political revolution!".

LOL, even though we are for gun control, we&apos;re going to take over the country violently and force you to accept Medicare for all.

I would disagree: With the Clintons we very much know what we&apos;re in for.  It is with this new brand of right-wing Republicanism (Trump and Cruz) that ought to make you shiver as they continue to goose step in unison in taking over the entire government!

"I throw no shade at Sanders just because he’s a Democrat-come-lately..." One of the most disingenuous comments imaginable.

That&apos;s Walsh&apos;s oh so obvious rhetorical strategy...put all the crap out there and then say, but I don&apos;t accept that, at least completely.

So much history to think about, but too few issues talked about.  Real issues like Citizens United.  HRC want to reverse it but doesn&apos;t set the example like Bernie.  HRC voted for the Iraq war, saw its results and voted to do the same to Libya with the same terrible results. Awful judgment in my eyes. Bernie wants the support of all people while HRC appeals to the rich and corporations. HRC is a neo-con on foreign policy. She would rather spend money on the military than reversing global warming. These issues are a no-brainer.  Bernie is America&apos;s champion; he is simply what we need right now.

I mostly agree with Joan&apos;s analysis. However, she did not elaborate on the real reasons the superdelegates will not switch to Sanders: 
1) Sanders wins have, for the most part, been with a small percent of a non-diverse electorate in more sparsely populated states. Despite winning 14 contests, Sanders is more than 2.3 million votes behind Clinton. This number is only likely to grow between now and the end of April.
2) Clinton won the very important swing states of Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio by large margins. Not only are these states, crucial to Electoral College math, but they are also diverse.
3) Clinton has raised over $30 million for the DNC and down-ballot races, while Sanders has done virtually nothing to help his “fellow” Democrats.
4) Sanders has moved the conversation leftwards, but he has a long history of denigrating the Democratic Party.
5) Despite Sanders rhetoric to the contrary, and his large advantage among millennials, according to the turnout so far as compared to 2008, when a real political movement did arise, his political revolution has not materialized. 

Ms. Walsh also failed to mention that neither Obama nor Clinton entered the 2008 convention with enough pledged delegates. Both were essentially tied in the popular vote total. And it’s true he won more contest than she. But it was his lead in pledged delegates that augured well for him winning the nomination even as he needed the support of superdelegates to do so. 

However, I am convinced that the superdelegates took the historic nature of the moment into account as well as the math. I suspect they will do the same with Mrs. Clinton, even as her math will be more convincing than his ever was.  She will have more pledged delegates, a larger popular vote tally and will have won more states. 

My main point of contention with Ms. Walsh’s analysis is that any attempt by the Sanders campaign to snatch the nomination from Sec. Clinton given these parameters would be very divisive. Worse still, such an attempt could well throw away the advantage that the chaos on the Republican side gives us. In this, Sanders die-hard supporters would likely make good on their threats and stay home in November. Such a disaster would be magnified if Trump or Cruz do not win the GOP nomination at a contested convention, should that occur, but someone like Paul Ryan does. Thus Sanders would become Nader 2.0—on steroids.

I have no intention of staying home in November. I&apos;m excited about some of the down ballot candidates!

Good analysis!

I&apos;ve seen this argument on Daily Kos and it makes no more sense on second reading than on the first.
HRC represents identity politics (vote for her because she&apos;s female) and "raises funds for other Democrats" (that&apos;s been fact-checked:  yes, she does, but 70% of what she raises under that banner goes to her own campaign.)  Bernie is running not on who he is but on what, and who, he represents.  And what he is raising for other Democrats is more important than money--it&apos;s brand-new voters who will NOT show up for the general to support anyone who stands for the status quo.  In their view, four more years of Barack Obama is the last thing we need.
I&apos;m not speaking for myself here. I&apos;ll probably vote Green in the general, but California, where I live, will go for the Democrat even if it&apos;s Rahm Emanuel or (heaven forfend) Debby Wasserman Schultz. The point is all those younger voters.
If HRC is nominated, she had better hope the GOP finds some way to keep Donald Trump off their ticker.  She could beat Cruz or Kasich, but Trump has done such a great job of positioning himself as anti-establishment that he, too, is bringing in new voters, on the wrong sidei.  He&apos;ll beat Ms. Establishment handily, and go on to appoint troglodytes to the SCOTUS while waltzing with the Republican House and Senate.  Oh yeah, the down-ballot effect will be tremendous.  It&apos;s not about the money, it&apos;s who&apos;s at the head of the ticket.  If the Dems run Sanders, they have a really good chance to take back the Senate.
BTW, EW belongs on the SCOTUS, not in the White House.  Unless Trump wins the presidency, EW should be the next Supreme Court nominee.

As an objective Bernie supporter, I am torn by this prescient article. I can see the argument; the comparison analysis is gripping, and I venture that not too many Bernistas have seen this flap in this light. I am inclined to say: as far as HRC is from a progessive ideal, she is, as some wag (Bernie?) said months ago, "On her worst day, Hillary is a thousand times better than (fill in the blank), (Trump), (Cruz)".

I add, as an age contemporary for Bernie: EW will be the next standard bearer in 2020, because Bernie&apos;s endeavors have probably made him vulnerable to the awful physical and mental drain that this historical effort subjects him to. In my mind, however, he is like Ghandi or MLK, more than JFK, and will be a beacon for all of us who want a better country for all of us. The more of us who can adopt that sentiment, the better we, and our country, will become. Before it is too late.  aures lupi

I&apos;m a Bernista, and I haven&apos;t seen the campaign in this light because I am not part of that campaign.  I don&apos;t have a bumper sticker or a lawn sign, but I do have a grave concern for our country and the world if HRC winds up running against Donald Trump.  Mark my words--she will lose that race.  No more appealing to minority voters whose red states will go GOP anyhow.  No appeal at all to younger, anti-establishment voters.  This is the year of the outsider.  It&apos;ll take one to beat one.

The main article is totally an inside-the-beltway view.  From that perspective, policy has already been settled (it was all done in the 1990s by Faustian bargains between Bill Clinton and the Republicans who made a great show of hating him).  To those insiders, it&apos;s all about campaign contributions and who owes what to whom.  Doesn&apos;t it remind you of the Academy Awards?

Hillary will not be the nominee.
