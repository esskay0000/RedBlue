In the 2008 presidential primary, Democrats chose between a black candidate and a white candidate. Yes, that described the race of the two leading rivals, but also their constituencies: Barack Obama won 82 percent of African-American votes, while Hillary Clinton won most whites, including 62 percent of whites without a college degree.

In 2016, once again, throughout most of the primary campaign, there’s been a black candidate and a white candidate—when it comes to their supporters, anyway. Only this time, it’s Clinton who’s racking up the black vote, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders who has been leading among whites, especially the white working class, while losing roughly 4–1 among the African-American voters who are the bedrock of the Democratic Party. In states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Michigan, Sanders beat Clinton among whites without a college degree. And this time, it’s Sanders who is making the political case for the importance of winning back white voters, particularly working-class whites, to the Democratic Party, as Clinton did eight years ago.		
And as I did, too. I began the 2008 primary season thinking Clinton’s support from white working-class voters was a sign that Democrats could make inroads there, and win back so-called Reagan Democrats to the party of FDR. I ended the 2008 contests in despair, seeing Clinton’s attempt to win white votes devolve into her using her support from “hard-working Americans, white Americans” against Obama in a way that rightly repelled African Americans, and me too. By 2012, I no longer saw a way for Democrats to win back vast numbers of whites that didn’t involve somehow negating the power, influence, and interests of African Americans, who have become the most reliable Democratic voters. Negating that influence would be politically stupid as well as morally wrong.		
Bernie Sanders is going to eventually have to take in that reality. As he saw his hopes in the South crushed by black voters, who went four or even five to one for Clinton, his campaign made noises—increasingly unpleasant noises, to the ears of some black voters—about how that might change as the race moved from south to north. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver insulted black voters by dismissing Clinton as a “regional” candidate only popular in the South. Jane Sanders, the candidate’s wife and best surrogate, even suggested that the “Obama coalition” was a shopworn, 2008 phenomenon; a new “Sanders coalition” might make it possible for her husband to win with the support of fewer African Americans and more working-class whites.		
And Sanders himself staked his chances on the perspicacity of Northern black voters. “I think you’re going to see us doing—and I think the polls indicated it—much better within the African-American community outside of the Deep South,” Sanders said after losing South Carolina. “You’re going to see us much better in New York State, where I think we have a shot to win, in California and in Michigan.”

Well, he did do better in Michigan. He won the primary, and he got 28 percent of the African-American vote, as opposed to 5 to 25 percent in other states. That was widely hailed as an improvement; it really shouldn’t have been. In Ohio, he got 28 percent of the black vote, according to CNN exit polls; in Illinois, where he hoped to do well because of African-American anger at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had endorsed Clinton, he won 29 percent. In North Carolina and Florida, he did almost as poorly as he did in South Carolina. He had his best night with black voters in Missouri (go figure), where he won 32 percent. And even among black millennials, Sanders trailed Clinton in the March 15 primaries, winning just 36 percent.		
If doing “better” with African Americans wins meaning three in 10 rather than one in 10, the Sanders coalition is in real trouble. No Democrat can win the party’s nomination with only a third of African-American voters. And no Democrat should.		
Clinton’s big wins last week almost certainly guarantee her the nomination. Sanders promises to fight on, however, and he deserves to. He’s raising crucial issues, and he’s already helped pull Clinton to the left. But if he wants his effort to yield lasting organizing victories for the left, he better study the lessons of the first half of his campaign. One thing should already be clear: No multiracial, left-wing coalition can be successfully built out from a white base. Let’s stop trying.

I once believed that a full-throated populist strategy could bring large numbers of white, working-class voters back to the Democratic Party, and that such a focus would improve American politics and the party. Why did I change my mind? Partly because I saw how divisive it was when Clinton (sort of) tried it. I ultimately wound up writing a whole book about it—What’s the Matter With White People?—though I didn’t think that’s what I was doing when I set out to write.		
Back in 2008, I was a Clinton defender who eventually became a Clinton supporter, because I thought the media, and much of the left, had irrationally anointed Obama the progressive candidate, even though many of Clinton’s domestic policies were to his left. Her healthcare plan covered everyone; Obama’s left at least 15 million unprotected. She railed against growing evidence of bad banking behavior, even before the crash, coming out for a foreclosure moratorium, for the regulation of derivatives and for closing the “carried interest” loophole that privileged investment banking. Obama supported none of these proposals and, even running against the New York senator, he became the preferred candidate of Wall Street.

The fact that she had much more white working-class support than Obama in 2008 only “proved” to me what I’d always believed—that those voters might return to the party of FDR if someone ran a sufficiently populist campaign. That someone seemed to be Hillary Clinton. In her moral and political defense, she also had the votes of Latinos and women (which Sanders does not this cycle). I knew some of Clinton’s white, working-class support surely had to do with Obama’s race, but it made me uncomfortable when his supporters suggested that was all there was to it. Eight years later, I’ve got to admit that racism drove some of Clinton’s supporters much more than I wanted to believe.		
Now it’s Bernie Sanders who is the “white” candidate, supported by many of those same working-class voters. The extent to which they’ve abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me. I think there are a few explanations for this shift, the first of which is that Sanders is genuinely appealing to working-class white voters—they like fighters and outsiders, and they respond to a strong populist pitch. But we also have to contend with the extent to which Clinton may have been damaged by her close association with our first black president, serving as his secretary of state and eventually forging a close alliance with him. This relationship solidified Clinton’s status as “the black candidate,” while at the same time burnishing her credentials as a member of the global elite—a combination that was unimaginable eight years ago. Coming out of the administration and joining the Clinton Foundation only cemented that elite status. Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should.		
We should also acknowledge the extent to which Sanders has won whites by crafting a class-based appeal that minimizes, and sometimes even diminishes, the role that racism plays in creating American social and economic inequality. He has done so for his whole political career. Sanders is in some ways uniquely suited to be the Democrats’ white, working-class standard-bearer, because a career in 98 percent white Vermont has kept him on the right side of some issues that hurt Democrats with that group. Over the years, moving out from his Burlington base, Sanders carefully crafted a coalition that includes both urban progressives and rural, gun-owning moderates. The votes and positions that put him to the right of most Democrats, on guns and immigration, play well with his overwhelmingly white base. He frankly defends his pro-gun votes as necessary to serve his rural, gun-owning constituency. Protecting his rural and lower-income white base also explains why he voted against the 2007 immigration bill. During the 2016 campaign, he has said he cast that vote because the bill would have created a caste of guest workers living in conditions akin to slavery. But at the time, he also told the race-baiting CNN pundit Lou Dobbs that pro-reform senators are “selling out American workers. In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

Even his decision over the years to run as a socialist, or an Independent, and not as a Democrat, has helped Sanders with his white, working-class base, which a slew of research shows has come to see Democrats as the party of minorities. In other states, “socialist” might be an albatross of a label; in Vermont, the term “Democrat” may cost you votes. “I look at these things more from a class perspective,” he told Nate Cohn of The New York Times last year, after Cohn minimized Sanders’s chances to win the Democratic nomination. “I’m not a liberal. Never have been. I’m a progressive who mostly focuses on the working and middle class.” Many of his supporters “may not be liberal” and may not “agree with me on gay marriage,” he told Cohn, but “they want a fighter.” In Vermont, liberals “have not been [my] strongest supporters,” he noted; his support came from white working-class voters.		
In 2012, Sanders ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, with the agreement of party leaders. But he refused to run on the party line that November, keeping an “I” next to his name on the general election ballot, even though he caucused with Senate Democrats. Watching his political calculation in this primary campaign, I’ve come to believe that was at least partly because he thought the label “Democrat” hurt his chances with working-class whites.		
In 2016, all of these calculations have hurt him with the Democratic base.		
* * *		
After Obama’s first election, Sanders emerged as one of his sharpest critics, the only person in Congress to suggest that the president should face a primary from the left. I remember the conditions in late 2011 that gave rise to such a suggestion, the series of useless compromises with an intransigent GOP that culminated in the awful and thankfully unsuccessful “grand bargain.” I made enemies with my own criticism of the president back then.
But it was, in fact, Sanders’s call to primary Obama that forced me to reckon with the reality of the 21st-century Democratic base—the bedrock of which is African-American voters. Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.		
		

In 2016, once again, throughout most of the primary campaign, there’s been a black candidate and a white candidate—when it comes to their supporters, anyway.

They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.		
		

And as I did, too. I began the 2008 primary season thinking Clinton’s support from white working-class voters was a sign that Democrats could make inroads there, and win back so-called Reagan Democrats to the party of FDR. I ended the 2008 contests in despair, seeing Clinton’s attempt to win white votes devolve into her using her support from “hard-working Americans, white Americans” against Obama in a way that rightly repelled African Americans, and me too. By 2012, I no longer saw a way for Democrats to win back vast numbers of whites that didn’t involve somehow negating the power, influence, and interests of African Americans, who have become the most reliable Democratic voters. Negating that influence would be politically stupid as well as morally wrong.		
Bernie Sanders is going to eventually have to take in that reality. As he saw his hopes in the South crushed by black voters, who went four or even five to one for Clinton, his campaign made noises—increasingly unpleasant noises, to the ears of some black voters—about how that might change as the race moved from south to north. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver insulted black voters by dismissing Clinton as a “regional” candidate only popular in the South. Jane Sanders, the candidate’s wife and best surrogate, even suggested that the “Obama coalition” was a shopworn, 2008 phenomenon; a new “Sanders coalition” might make it possible for her husband to win with the support of fewer African Americans and more working-class whites.		
And Sanders himself staked his chances on the perspicacity of Northern black voters. “I think you’re going to see us doing—and I think the polls indicated it—much better within the African-American community outside of the Deep South,” Sanders said after losing South Carolina. “You’re going to see us much better in New York State, where I think we have a shot to win, in California and in Michigan.”

Well, he did do better in Michigan. He won the primary, and he got 28 percent of the African-American vote, as opposed to 5 to 25 percent in other states. That was widely hailed as an improvement; it really shouldn’t have been. In Ohio, he got 28 percent of the black vote, according to CNN exit polls; in Illinois, where he hoped to do well because of African-American anger at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had endorsed Clinton, he won 29 percent. In North Carolina and Florida, he did almost as poorly as he did in South Carolina. He had his best night with black voters in Missouri (go figure), where he won 32 percent. And even among black millennials, Sanders trailed Clinton in the March 15 primaries, winning just 36 percent.		
If doing “better” with African Americans wins meaning three in 10 rather than one in 10, the Sanders coalition is in real trouble. No Democrat can win the party’s nomination with only a third of African-American voters. And no Democrat should.		
Clinton’s big wins last week almost certainly guarantee her the nomination. Sanders promises to fight on, however, and he deserves to. He’s raising crucial issues, and he’s already helped pull Clinton to the left. But if he wants his effort to yield lasting organizing victories for the left, he better study the lessons of the first half of his campaign. One thing should already be clear: No multiracial, left-wing coalition can be successfully built out from a white base. Let’s stop trying.

I once believed that a full-throated populist strategy could bring large numbers of white, working-class voters back to the Democratic Party, and that such a focus would improve American politics and the party. Why did I change my mind? Partly because I saw how divisive it was when Clinton (sort of) tried it. I ultimately wound up writing a whole book about it—What’s the Matter With White People?—though I didn’t think that’s what I was doing when I set out to write.		
Back in 2008, I was a Clinton defender who eventually became a Clinton supporter, because I thought the media, and much of the left, had irrationally anointed Obama the progressive candidate, even though many of Clinton’s domestic policies were to his left. Her healthcare plan covered everyone; Obama’s left at least 15 million unprotected. She railed against growing evidence of bad banking behavior, even before the crash, coming out for a foreclosure moratorium, for the regulation of derivatives and for closing the “carried interest” loophole that privileged investment banking. Obama supported none of these proposals and, even running against the New York senator, he became the preferred candidate of Wall Street.

The fact that she had much more white working-class support than Obama in 2008 only “proved” to me what I’d always believed—that those voters might return to the party of FDR if someone ran a sufficiently populist campaign. That someone seemed to be Hillary Clinton. In her moral and political defense, she also had the votes of Latinos and women (which Sanders does not this cycle). I knew some of Clinton’s white, working-class support surely had to do with Obama’s race, but it made me uncomfortable when his supporters suggested that was all there was to it. Eight years later, I’ve got to admit that racism drove some of Clinton’s supporters much more than I wanted to believe.		
Now it’s Bernie Sanders who is the “white” candidate, supported by many of those same working-class voters. The extent to which they’ve abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me. I think there are a few explanations for this shift, the first of which is that Sanders is genuinely appealing to working-class white voters—they like fighters and outsiders, and they respond to a strong populist pitch. But we also have to contend with the extent to which Clinton may have been damaged by her close association with our first black president, serving as his secretary of state and eventually forging a close alliance with him. This relationship solidified Clinton’s status as “the black candidate,” while at the same time burnishing her credentials as a member of the global elite—a combination that was unimaginable eight years ago. Coming out of the administration and joining the Clinton Foundation only cemented that elite status. Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should.		
We should also acknowledge the extent to which Sanders has won whites by crafting a class-based appeal that minimizes, and sometimes even diminishes, the role that racism plays in creating American social and economic inequality. He has done so for his whole political career. Sanders is in some ways uniquely suited to be the Democrats’ white, working-class standard-bearer, because a career in 98 percent white Vermont has kept him on the right side of some issues that hurt Democrats with that group. Over the years, moving out from his Burlington base, Sanders carefully crafted a coalition that includes both urban progressives and rural, gun-owning moderates. The votes and positions that put him to the right of most Democrats, on guns and immigration, play well with his overwhelmingly white base. He frankly defends his pro-gun votes as necessary to serve his rural, gun-owning constituency. Protecting his rural and lower-income white base also explains why he voted against the 2007 immigration bill. During the 2016 campaign, he has said he cast that vote because the bill would have created a caste of guest workers living in conditions akin to slavery. But at the time, he also told the race-baiting CNN pundit Lou Dobbs that pro-reform senators are “selling out American workers. In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

Even his decision over the years to run as a socialist, or an Independent, and not as a Democrat, has helped Sanders with his white, working-class base, which a slew of research shows has come to see Democrats as the party of minorities. In other states, “socialist” might be an albatross of a label; in Vermont, the term “Democrat” may cost you votes. “I look at these things more from a class perspective,” he told Nate Cohn of The New York Times last year, after Cohn minimized Sanders’s chances to win the Democratic nomination. “I’m not a liberal. Never have been. I’m a progressive who mostly focuses on the working and middle class.” Many of his supporters “may not be liberal” and may not “agree with me on gay marriage,” he told Cohn, but “they want a fighter.” In Vermont, liberals “have not been [my] strongest supporters,” he noted; his support came from white working-class voters.		
In 2012, Sanders ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, with the agreement of party leaders. But he refused to run on the party line that November, keeping an “I” next to his name on the general election ballot, even though he caucused with Senate Democrats. Watching his political calculation in this primary campaign, I’ve come to believe that was at least partly because he thought the label “Democrat” hurt his chances with working-class whites.		
In 2016, all of these calculations have hurt him with the Democratic base.		
* * *		
After Obama’s first election, Sanders emerged as one of his sharpest critics, the only person in Congress to suggest that the president should face a primary from the left. I remember the conditions in late 2011 that gave rise to such a suggestion, the series of useless compromises with an intransigent GOP that culminated in the awful and thankfully unsuccessful “grand bargain.” I made enemies with my own criticism of the president back then.
But it was, in fact, Sanders’s call to primary Obama that forced me to reckon with the reality of the 21st-century Democratic base—the bedrock of which is African-American voters. Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group.

And even among black millennials, Sanders trailed Clinton in the March 15 primaries, winning just 36 percent.		
If doing “better” with African Americans wins meaning three in 10 rather than one in 10, the Sanders coalition is in real trouble. No Democrat can win the party’s nomination with only a third of African-American voters. And no Democrat should.		
Clinton’s big wins last week almost certainly guarantee her the nomination. Sanders promises to fight on, however, and he deserves to. He’s raising crucial issues, and he’s already helped pull Clinton to the left. But if he wants his effort to yield lasting organizing victories for the left, he better study the lessons of the first half of his campaign. One thing should already be clear: No multiracial, left-wing coalition can be successfully built out from a white base. Let’s stop trying.

I once believed that a full-throated populist strategy could bring large numbers of white, working-class voters back to the Democratic Party, and that such a focus would improve American politics and the party. Why did I change my mind? Partly because I saw how divisive it was when Clinton (sort of) tried it. I ultimately wound up writing a whole book about it—What’s the Matter With White People?—though I didn’t think that’s what I was doing when I set out to write.		
Back in 2008, I was a Clinton defender who eventually became a Clinton supporter, because I thought the media, and much of the left, had irrationally anointed Obama the progressive candidate, even though many of Clinton’s domestic policies were to his left. Her healthcare plan covered everyone; Obama’s left at least 15 million unprotected. She railed against growing evidence of bad banking behavior, even before the crash, coming out for a foreclosure moratorium, for the regulation of derivatives and for closing the “carried interest” loophole that privileged investment banking. Obama supported none of these proposals and, even running against the New York senator, he became the preferred candidate of Wall Street.

The fact that she had much more white working-class support than Obama in 2008 only “proved” to me what I’d always believed—that those voters might return to the party of FDR if someone ran a sufficiently populist campaign. That someone seemed to be Hillary Clinton. In her moral and political defense, she also had the votes of Latinos and women (which Sanders does not this cycle). I knew some of Clinton’s white, working-class support surely had to do with Obama’s race, but it made me uncomfortable when his supporters suggested that was all there was to it. Eight years later, I’ve got to admit that racism drove some of Clinton’s supporters much more than I wanted to believe.		
Now it’s Bernie Sanders who is the “white” candidate, supported by many of those same working-class voters. The extent to which they’ve abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me. I think there are a few explanations for this shift, the first of which is that Sanders is genuinely appealing to working-class white voters—they like fighters and outsiders, and they respond to a strong populist pitch. But we also have to contend with the extent to which Clinton may have been damaged by her close association with our first black president, serving as his secretary of state and eventually forging a close alliance with him. This relationship solidified Clinton’s status as “the black candidate,” while at the same time burnishing her credentials as a member of the global elite—a combination that was unimaginable eight years ago. Coming out of the administration and joining the Clinton Foundation only cemented that elite status. Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should.		
We should also acknowledge the extent to which Sanders has won whites by crafting a class-based appeal that minimizes, and sometimes even diminishes, the role that racism plays in creating American social and economic inequality. He has done so for his whole political career. Sanders is in some ways uniquely suited to be the Democrats’ white, working-class standard-bearer, because a career in 98 percent white Vermont has kept him on the right side of some issues that hurt Democrats with that group. Over the years, moving out from his Burlington base, Sanders carefully crafted a coalition that includes both urban progressives and rural, gun-owning moderates. The votes and positions that put him to the right of most Democrats, on guns and immigration, play well with his overwhelmingly white base. He frankly defends his pro-gun votes as necessary to serve his rural, gun-owning constituency. Protecting his rural and lower-income white base also explains why he voted against the 2007 immigration bill. During the 2016 campaign, he has said he cast that vote because the bill would have created a caste of guest workers living in conditions akin to slavery. But at the time, he also told the race-baiting CNN pundit Lou Dobbs that pro-reform senators are “selling out American workers. In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

Even his decision over the years to run as a socialist, or an Independent, and not as a Democrat, has helped Sanders with his white, working-class base, which a slew of research shows has come to see Democrats as the party of minorities. In other states, “socialist” might be an albatross of a label; in Vermont, the term “Democrat” may cost you votes. “I look at these things more from a class perspective,” he told Nate Cohn of The New York Times last year, after Cohn minimized Sanders’s chances to win the Democratic nomination. “I’m not a liberal. Never have been. I’m a progressive who mostly focuses on the working and middle class.” Many of his supporters “may not be liberal” and may not “agree with me on gay marriage,” he told Cohn, but “they want a fighter.” In Vermont, liberals “have not been [my] strongest supporters,” he noted; his support came from white working-class voters.		
In 2012, Sanders ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, with the agreement of party leaders. But he refused to run on the party line that November, keeping an “I” next to his name on the general election ballot, even though he caucused with Senate Democrats. Watching his political calculation in this primary campaign, I’ve come to believe that was at least partly because he thought the label “Democrat” hurt his chances with working-class whites.		
In 2016, all of these calculations have hurt him with the Democratic base.		
* * *		
After Obama’s first election, Sanders emerged as one of his sharpest critics, the only person in Congress to suggest that the president should face a primary from the left. I remember the conditions in late 2011 that gave rise to such a suggestion, the series of useless compromises with an intransigent GOP that culminated in the awful and thankfully unsuccessful “grand bargain.” I made enemies with my own criticism of the president back then.
But it was, in fact, Sanders’s call to primary Obama that forced me to reckon with the reality of the 21st-century Democratic base—the bedrock of which is African-American voters. Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.

What’s Wrong With Bernie Sanders’s Strategy

Well, he did do better in Michigan. He won the primary, and he got 28 percent of the African-American vote, as opposed to 5 to 25 percent in other states. That was widely hailed as an improvement; it really shouldn’t have been. In Ohio, he got 28 percent of the black vote, according to CNN exit polls; in Illinois, where he hoped to do well because of African-American anger at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had endorsed Clinton, he won 29 percent. In North Carolina and Florida, he did almost as poorly as he did in South Carolina. He had his best night with black voters in Missouri (go figure), where he won 32 percent.

In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

Even his decision over the years to run as a socialist, or an Independent, and not as a Democrat, has helped Sanders with his white, working-class base, which a slew of research shows has come to see Democrats as the party of minorities. In other states, “socialist” might be an albatross of a label; in Vermont, the term “Democrat” may cost you votes. “I look at these things more from a class perspective,” he told Nate Cohn of The New York Times last year, after Cohn minimized Sanders’s chances to win the Democratic nomination. “I’m not a liberal. Never have been. I’m a progressive who mostly focuses on the working and middle class.” Many of his supporters “may not be liberal” and may not “agree with me on gay marriage,” he told Cohn, but “they want a fighter.” In Vermont, liberals “have not been [my] strongest supporters,” he noted; his support came from white working-class voters.		
In 2012, Sanders ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, with the agreement of party leaders. But he refused to run on the party line that November, keeping an “I” next to his name on the general election ballot, even though he caucused with Senate Democrats. Watching his political calculation in this primary campaign, I’ve come to believe that was at least partly because he thought the label “Democrat” hurt his chances with working-class whites.		
In 2016, all of these calculations have hurt him with the Democratic base.		
* * *		
After Obama’s first election, Sanders emerged as one of his sharpest critics, the only person in Congress to suggest that the president should face a primary from the left. I remember the conditions in late 2011 that gave rise to such a suggestion, the series of useless compromises with an intransigent GOP that culminated in the awful and thankfully unsuccessful “grand bargain.” I made enemies with my own criticism of the president back then.
But it was, in fact, Sanders’s call to primary Obama that forced me to reckon with the reality of the 21st-century Democratic base—the bedrock of which is African-American voters. Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.		
		

Clinton’s big wins last week almost certainly guarantee her the nomination. Sanders promises to fight on, however, and he deserves to. He’s raising crucial issues, and he’s already helped pull Clinton to the left. But if he wants his effort to yield lasting organizing victories for the left, he better study the lessons of the first half of his campaign. One thing should already be clear: No multiracial, left-wing coalition can be successfully built out from a white base. Let’s stop trying.

I once believed that a full-throated populist strategy could bring large numbers of white, working-class voters back to the Democratic Party, and that such a focus would improve American politics and the party. Why did I change my mind? Partly because I saw how divisive it was when Clinton (sort of) tried it. I ultimately wound up writing a whole book about it—What’s the Matter With White People?—though I didn’t think that’s what I was doing when I set out to write.		
Back in 2008, I was a Clinton defender who eventually became a Clinton supporter, because I thought the media, and much of the left, had irrationally anointed Obama the progressive candidate, even though many of Clinton’s domestic policies were to his left. Her healthcare plan covered everyone; Obama’s left at least 15 million unprotected. She railed against growing evidence of bad banking behavior, even before the crash, coming out for a foreclosure moratorium, for the regulation of derivatives and for closing the “carried interest” loophole that privileged investment banking. Obama supported none of these proposals and, even running against the New York senator, he became the preferred candidate of Wall Street.

The fact that she had much more white working-class support than Obama in 2008 only “proved” to me what I’d always believed—that those voters might return to the party of FDR if someone ran a sufficiently populist campaign. That someone seemed to be Hillary Clinton. In her moral and political defense, she also had the votes of Latinos and women (which Sanders does not this cycle). I knew some of Clinton’s white, working-class support surely had to do with Obama’s race, but it made me uncomfortable when his supporters suggested that was all there was to it. Eight years later, I’ve got to admit that racism drove some of Clinton’s supporters much more than I wanted to believe.		
Now it’s Bernie Sanders who is the “white” candidate, supported by many of those same working-class voters. The extent to which they’ve abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me. I think there are a few explanations for this shift, the first of which is that Sanders is genuinely appealing to working-class white voters—they like fighters and outsiders, and they respond to a strong populist pitch. But we also have to contend with the extent to which Clinton may have been damaged by her close association with our first black president, serving as his secretary of state and eventually forging a close alliance with him. This relationship solidified Clinton’s status as “the black candidate,” while at the same time burnishing her credentials as a member of the global elite—a combination that was unimaginable eight years ago. Coming out of the administration and joining the Clinton Foundation only cemented that elite status. Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should.		
We should also acknowledge the extent to which Sanders has won whites by crafting a class-based appeal that minimizes, and sometimes even diminishes, the role that racism plays in creating American social and economic inequality. He has done so for his whole political career. Sanders is in some ways uniquely suited to be the Democrats’ white, working-class standard-bearer, because a career in 98 percent white Vermont has kept him on the right side of some issues that hurt Democrats with that group. Over the years, moving out from his Burlington base, Sanders carefully crafted a coalition that includes both urban progressives and rural, gun-owning moderates. The votes and positions that put him to the right of most Democrats, on guns and immigration, play well with his overwhelmingly white base. He frankly defends his pro-gun votes as necessary to serve his rural, gun-owning constituency. Protecting his rural and lower-income white base also explains why he voted against the 2007 immigration bill. During the 2016 campaign, he has said he cast that vote because the bill would have created a caste of guest workers living in conditions akin to slavery. But at the time, he also told the race-baiting CNN pundit Lou Dobbs that pro-reform senators are “selling out American workers. In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

I ultimately wound up writing a whole book about it—What’s the Matter With White People?—though I didn’t think that’s what I was doing when I set out to write.		
Back in 2008, I was a Clinton defender who eventually became a Clinton supporter, because I thought the media, and much of the left, had irrationally anointed Obama the progressive candidate, even though many of Clinton’s domestic policies were to his left. Her healthcare plan covered everyone; Obama’s left at least 15 million unprotected. She railed against growing evidence of bad banking behavior, even before the crash, coming out for a foreclosure moratorium, for the regulation of derivatives and for closing the “carried interest” loophole that privileged investment banking. Obama supported none of these proposals and, even running against the New York senator, he became the preferred candidate of Wall Street.

The fact that she had much more white working-class support than Obama in 2008 only “proved” to me what I’d always believed—that those voters might return to the party of FDR if someone ran a sufficiently populist campaign. That someone seemed to be Hillary Clinton. In her moral and political defense, she also had the votes of Latinos and women (which Sanders does not this cycle). I knew some of Clinton’s white, working-class support surely had to do with Obama’s race, but it made me uncomfortable when his supporters suggested that was all there was to it. Eight years later, I’ve got to admit that racism drove some of Clinton’s supporters much more than I wanted to believe.		
Now it’s Bernie Sanders who is the “white” candidate, supported by many of those same working-class voters. The extent to which they’ve abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me. I think there are a few explanations for this shift, the first of which is that Sanders is genuinely appealing to working-class white voters—they like fighters and outsiders, and they respond to a strong populist pitch. But we also have to contend with the extent to which Clinton may have been damaged by her close association with our first black president, serving as his secretary of state and eventually forging a close alliance with him. This relationship solidified Clinton’s status as “the black candidate,” while at the same time burnishing her credentials as a member of the global elite—a combination that was unimaginable eight years ago. Coming out of the administration and joining the Clinton Foundation only cemented that elite status. Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should.		
We should also acknowledge the extent to which Sanders has won whites by crafting a class-based appeal that minimizes, and sometimes even diminishes, the role that racism plays in creating American social and economic inequality. He has done so for his whole political career. Sanders is in some ways uniquely suited to be the Democrats’ white, working-class standard-bearer, because a career in 98 percent white Vermont has kept him on the right side of some issues that hurt Democrats with that group. Over the years, moving out from his Burlington base, Sanders carefully crafted a coalition that includes both urban progressives and rural, gun-owning moderates. The votes and positions that put him to the right of most Democrats, on guns and immigration, play well with his overwhelmingly white base. He frankly defends his pro-gun votes as necessary to serve his rural, gun-owning constituency. Protecting his rural and lower-income white base also explains why he voted against the 2007 immigration bill. During the 2016 campaign, he has said he cast that vote because the bill would have created a caste of guest workers living in conditions akin to slavery. But at the time, he also told the race-baiting CNN pundit Lou Dobbs that pro-reform senators are “selling out American workers. In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

Even his decision over the years to run as a socialist, or an Independent, and not as a Democrat, has helped Sanders with his white, working-class base, which a slew of research shows has come to see Democrats as the party of minorities. In other states, “socialist” might be an albatross of a label; in Vermont, the term “Democrat” may cost you votes. “I look at these things more from a class perspective,” he told Nate Cohn of The New York Times last year, after Cohn minimized Sanders’s chances to win the Democratic nomination. “I’m not a liberal. Never have been. I’m a progressive who mostly focuses on the working and middle class.” Many of his supporters “may not be liberal” and may not “agree with me on gay marriage,” he told Cohn, but “they want a fighter.” In Vermont, liberals “have not been [my] strongest supporters,” he noted; his support came from white working-class voters.		
In 2012, Sanders ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, with the agreement of party leaders. But he refused to run on the party line that November, keeping an “I” next to his name on the general election ballot, even though he caucused with Senate Democrats. Watching his political calculation in this primary campaign, I’ve come to believe that was at least partly because he thought the label “Democrat” hurt his chances with working-class whites.		
In 2016, all of these calculations have hurt him with the Democratic base.		
* * *		
After Obama’s first election, Sanders emerged as one of his sharpest critics, the only person in Congress to suggest that the president should face a primary from the left. I remember the conditions in late 2011 that gave rise to such a suggestion, the series of useless compromises with an intransigent GOP that culminated in the awful and thankfully unsuccessful “grand bargain.” I made enemies with my own criticism of the president back then.
But it was, in fact, Sanders’s call to primary Obama that forced me to reckon with the reality of the 21st-century Democratic base—the bedrock of which is African-American voters. Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.

I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.		
		

Now it’s Bernie Sanders who is the “white” candidate, supported by many of those same working-class voters. The extent to which they’ve abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me. I think there are a few explanations for this shift, the first of which is that Sanders is genuinely appealing to working-class white voters—they like fighters and outsiders, and they respond to a strong populist pitch. But we also have to contend with the extent to which Clinton may have been damaged by her close association with our first black president, serving as his secretary of state and eventually forging a close alliance with him. This relationship solidified Clinton’s status as “the black candidate,” while at the same time burnishing her credentials as a member of the global elite—a combination that was unimaginable eight years ago. Coming out of the administration and joining the Clinton Foundation only cemented that elite status. Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should.		
We should also acknowledge the extent to which Sanders has won whites by crafting a class-based appeal that minimizes, and sometimes even diminishes, the role that racism plays in creating American social and economic inequality. He has done so for his whole political career. Sanders is in some ways uniquely suited to be the Democrats’ white, working-class standard-bearer, because a career in 98 percent white Vermont has kept him on the right side of some issues that hurt Democrats with that group. Over the years, moving out from his Burlington base, Sanders carefully crafted a coalition that includes both urban progressives and rural, gun-owning moderates. The votes and positions that put him to the right of most Democrats, on guns and immigration, play well with his overwhelmingly white base. He frankly defends his pro-gun votes as necessary to serve his rural, gun-owning constituency. Protecting his rural and lower-income white base also explains why he voted against the 2007 immigration bill. During the 2016 campaign, he has said he cast that vote because the bill would have created a caste of guest workers living in conditions akin to slavery. But at the time, he also told the race-baiting CNN pundit Lou Dobbs that pro-reform senators are “selling out American workers. In fact, they are selling out our entire country.” When Dobbs replied by ranting against “illegal aliens” and “the amnesty legislation’s socio-ethnocentric interest groups who really have very little regard for the traditions of this country, the values of this country,” Sanders didn’t correct him, or note that those “values” included xenophobia and racism.

Even his decision over the years to run as a socialist, or an Independent, and not as a Democrat, has helped Sanders with his white, working-class base, which a slew of research shows has come to see Democrats as the party of minorities. In other states, “socialist” might be an albatross of a label; in Vermont, the term “Democrat” may cost you votes. “I look at these things more from a class perspective,” he told Nate Cohn of The New York Times last year, after Cohn minimized Sanders’s chances to win the Democratic nomination. “I’m not a liberal. Never have been. I’m a progressive who mostly focuses on the working and middle class.” Many of his supporters “may not be liberal” and may not “agree with me on gay marriage,” he told Cohn, but “they want a fighter.” In Vermont, liberals “have not been [my] strongest supporters,” he noted; his support came from white working-class voters.		
In 2012, Sanders ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, with the agreement of party leaders. But he refused to run on the party line that November, keeping an “I” next to his name on the general election ballot, even though he caucused with Senate Democrats. Watching his political calculation in this primary campaign, I’ve come to believe that was at least partly because he thought the label “Democrat” hurt his chances with working-class whites.		
In 2016, all of these calculations have hurt him with the Democratic base.

After Obama’s first election, Sanders emerged as one of his sharpest critics, the only person in Congress to suggest that the president should face a primary from the left. I remember the conditions in late 2011 that gave rise to such a suggestion, the series of useless compromises with an intransigent GOP that culminated in the awful and thankfully unsuccessful “grand bargain.” I made enemies with my own criticism of the president back then.
But it was, in fact, Sanders’s call to primary Obama that forced me to reckon with the reality of the 21st-century Democratic base—the bedrock of which is African-American voters. Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP.

Given the horrific racism faced by the first black president, they weren’t going to see him primaried just because some loud-mouthed, white progressives thought he handled that intransigence, driven in part by racism, less than optimally. At some point, I had to say to myself: Shut up and listen. I am not sure Bernie Sanders ever shut up and listened.		
Hillary Clinton did, I believe. She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.

None of this makes Clinton a better person than Sanders; it does make her a better student of Democratic Party politics, however. As I wrote last July, “Bernie Sanders does his own math,” and right now it’s not adding up. I don’t think it ever will.		
At one time, I did my own math too—and in the end, it didn’t add up either. Back in 2008, my biggest problem with Obama was that I just didn’t believe he could win the presidency. When he won in 2008, and then again in 2012, that was it for me. I understood that the Democratic Party owes its occupancy of the White House to the Obama coalition: African Americans, Latinos, Asians, LGBT folks, and single women. Unfortunately, chasing white, working-class voters too often involves appeals that either passively neglect that coalition, or actively drive much of it away. Somehow Sanders doesn’t seem to see that. But that may well be because he is not, at heart, a Democrat.		
“I am not a Democrat,” he once told The Progressive, “because the Democratic Party does not represent, and has not for many years, the interests of my constituency, which is primarily working families, middle-class people and low-income people.” Sanders needs to place the modifier “white” in front of all three groups, because the vast majority of African Americans, and most Latinos and Asians too, have come to believe the Democratic Party serves their interests, albeit imperfectly.		
Sanders’s avid supporters haven’t helped him on this score. The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.

The sexism of the so-called BernieBro phenomenon has gotten most of the attention, but the racial cluelessness of the Bros has been pretty remarkable too. Many ooze condescension, dismissing Southern blacks as “low-information” voters. As the race moved north, many continued to lament that African Americans don’t seem to know what’s best for them as they vote for Clinton. The Sanders-supporting Progressive Democrats of America dismissed Clinton’s Southern victories as confined to “the Confederacy,” ignoring the fact that descendants of people enslaved by the Confederacy were the ones propelling big Clinton wins. To its credit, the group apologized. But Sanders himself continues to minimize Clinton’s Southern wins, because Democrats are “not going to win those states in the general election.” Media analyst Clay Shirky dubbed Sanders’s frequent racial flubs the “kettledrum effect,” an inverse dog whistle in which African Americans hear slights, insensitivities, and gaffes that voters who aren’t black may not.		
If the Sanders movement is going to grow, it will only grow because more of his supporters begin to recognize their racial blind spots. I continue to hope that the populist policies championed by Sanders—on trade, on union rights, on Wall Street—will win white working-class voters back from the GOP. I hope that if, as seems almost certain, Clinton is the nominee, she will continue her leftward shift that we’ve seen during the primaries, and learn from the success of Sanders’s bold message with this group. They’re up for grabs, as both parties identify them as the cornerstone of Donald Trump’s coalition. Some in the GOP want to throw them out, even though they’ve been the party’s loyal base since Reagan.		
Winning more working-class whites would make Clinton’s job easier in November—and might help Democrats reverse their terrible midterm election declines. But Clinton should also learn from Sanders’s experience with black voters, and from her own in 2008. A multiracial coalition that relies on either dog whistles or kettledrums to win white voters isn’t worth building, and can never succeed.

When civil rights, feminism and antiwar movements came to the fore in the Sixties, we didn&apos;t choose our positions because we were liberals.  Liberal is what America decided to label people who were already post-race, post-gender and post-war thinkers.  Forty years later, faced with a choice between a woman and an African-American for the nomination, people such as us supported the latter.  Neither race nor gender entered into our thinking.  We&apos;ve moved on to attempting to do something about the rigged system, because we know it – not political personalities – is creating oppression.  Will climate change, income inequality, the criminal justice state and military-industrial complex abate when we&apos;ve managed defeat thinking that was outmoded fifty years ago?

What’s the matter with Joan Walsh? Does she really believe that Sanders is trying to attract ONLY white folks? Most Afro-American voters simply prefer HRC over him. If that is being caused by some type of Sanders stiff-arm, pushing those people away, I’m not seeing it and Walsh does not have any persuasive examples to offer. The worst she can do is to question Sanders’ honesty when he says that the reason he voted against a 2007 immigration bill that would have sanctioned indentured servitude in the USA. Many Latinos in positions of influence felt likewise. Walsh’s analysis is an inch deep and a mile wrong. One thing that eight years of Republican-lite “leadership” under Obama have proved is that half of Democrat voters don’t expect, and maybe really don’t WANT much to change under ANY President. In that light, a vote for HRC is not out of the ordinary.

This article points to some important issues, but then leads to the wrong analysis and conclusion. It has long been the case for both parties that there has been a trade-off between black and white votes (the more of one, the less of the other). (See Paul Frymer’s analysis in Uneasy Alliances.) Because of this, until the Civil Rights Movement, the Democratic Party focused on class issues, while keeping race off the table. After the Civil Rights Movement, and especially after the election of 1958, this strategy was no longer feasible, creating a challenge for the Democratic Party of having to hold together a biracial coalition in order to win elections.

Bill Clinton was the first Democratic president to win after the Reagan revolution ended with white Southerners moving from the Democratic to the Republican Party, leading to parity in the electoral college between the two parties. As a Southern politician, Bill Clinton understood the implications for the Democratic Party from that point forward. The South represents one sixth of the economy and enough electoral votes that the Republicans only need about a third of the electoral votes outside the South to win the presidency. By the time of the Clinton election, the Democratic Party included three main constituents, the white working class (especially in the Midwest), race and ethnic minorities, and professionals who moved from the Republican to the Democratic Party in reaction against the growing influence of religious conservatives in the Republican Party. The interests of these groups are often diametrically opposed, and they often blame the Party for supporting policies that they think favor the interests of the others at their expense. The Democratic Party needs all three constituencies to win elections. They cannot afford a trade-off between one group and the others.

Bernie Sanders comes out of an Old Left/New Deal politics that focused on class issues over race, on male issues over those of women, on the white working class over racial minorities, and so on. While the Old Left white economic progressives, like Bernie, might be supportive of the issues of racial minorities, women, and others, they had to be reminded by the Civil Rights Movement, the Women’s Movement, the anti-war movement, and so on that these were important issues. Sanders may have strong progressive values, but what he talks about most are the issues of the Old Left/New Deal: class, the economy, and attacking the rich, the banks, and the 1%. Those are his priorities, and it is not just because he has lived and done his politics from Vermont. It is because his politics have been shaped by this type of class-based economism. 

For Democrats to win, they need high turn out, and then 40%+ of the white vote, a majority+ of the women’s vote, 90%+ of the African American vote, and 60%+ of the votes of Hispanics and Asians (See Black and Black in Divided America). They also need to appeal to the white working class, especially in the Midwest, and to as many independents (most of whom used to be Republicans and whose politics lean center right). 

I have a longer analysis of these issues in Ch. 5 of my 2013 book, The American Non-dilemma.

We need a social movement on the left that consolidates the left, not divides it. The general electorate is mostly center-right (only 24% identify as liberal according to the 2014 Gallup poll). The Supreme Court and the Senate are at stake in this election, with both domestic and global threats all around. We need a unified left wing movement broad enough to incorporate the dreams of all, and not just the ideologically pure. In my view, Hillary Clinton represents a broader politics that is concerned about inequality, but also women’s rights, civil rights, and other progressive issues from the politics post-New Deal.

I thought Bernie&apos;s statements in the current 3/21/16 issue of the New Yorker in a piece by Ryan Lizza said tons. On why having trouble getting black support, he said he wasn&apos;t, it was just a generational divide, not a racial divide, hence HRC&apos;s strong appeal to older blacks. And why&apos;s that? Bernie pointed out that she was First Lady of Arkansas for 12 years and that hubby Bill has deep ties to many prominent, political blacks. So deep familiarity. I agree with those who are stating that Bernie is speaking for the many while the Madame Sec&apos;y speaks for the few. With her, it will be, essentially, same old, same old. So hip that Spike Lee, Cornell West, Harry Belafonte and many others realize Bernie&apos;s pull, his honesty and caring. As, of course, does Michelle Williams in her excellent piece in this magazine on why Hillary does not deserve the black vote. I wonder if Bernie had gotten/would get a really fair amount of press coverage if the tables might turn. Alas.

Please correct your post to read the correct name - Michelle Alexander, not Michelle Williams.  She also wrote a book: "The New Jim Crow". As for the luminaries supporting Sanders, that&apos;s all well and good. HRC has luminaries as well as a much larger constiuency that&apos;s much more inclusive, the very groups Joan Walsh named in the article.  If you&apos;re open minded enough to read an article by one of HRC&apos;s luminaries, and why she&apos;s getting HIS vote, please see this article by the esteemed Michael Eric Dyson. 
https://newrepublic.com/article/124391/yes-she-can

Bernie mistake obviously is he left himself too open to caricature without building in the rebuttal. All most people heard was spend and tax - and socialist.

Having read all comments I especially agree that Walsh is attempting to pigeon-hole Sanders as a candidate for white people. How many times did she use the word white? Sanders is not a mainstream candidate. He is an activist for all people...no matter their race. In DuPage County, IL Sanders won, as he did he most Chicago suburbs. I spoke with many students at College of DuPage. Ninety percent of those I spoke with in two hours were feeling the Bern, and half of them were African American, and many were Latino.

"how many times did Walsh used the word &apos;white&apos;?"

How can an article describing Bernie&apos;s failure as a candidate not discuss his failure with black voters and resulting success with white voters?  
Those of us who love Hillary Clinton had to -2008- deal with the reality that some were on our side because of Barack&apos;s skin color, that they would support whomever ran against the possibility of a black president.  We had the false comfort that many of Barack&apos;s supporters were Hillary haters who voted with him because they could not stand the idea of a female president.  Joan Walsh talks about having to wake up to that kind of racism in the 2008 campaign.  Can Bernie supporters lick their wounds and face this uncomfortable truth too?  that an ugly aspect of some of their number just hates Hillary for being a woman and some resent her ever helping Obama win and standing by his side for 6 years?  The comments here indicate that such introspection is not currently in the cards.

Please note Mr. Currier&apos;s tendentious use of the gender card: ". . . some of their number just hates [sic] Hillary for being a woman . . . ."  For some reason Mr. Currier connects disliking Mrs. Clinton to the fact that she is a woman; I thought it was because Mrs. Clinton sells herself to Wall Street, or she refuses to release transcripts of her speeches, or she cynically changes  positions for political reasons, or she considers Kissinger a mentor and friend, or she is the co-owner of the most audacious influence peddling scheme in American history, or . . . . you know, those sorts of reasons. But because she&apos;s a woman? Not even close, Mr. Currier, not even close.

People can obviously dislike anyone for any reason. But a good deal of HRC hatred, aka CDS,  is is precisely because of rank misogyny. The BernieBros I&apos;ve dealt with on twitter and elsewhere prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt, in my experience. Or as Shirley Chisolm said (she ran for president in 1972):
Of my two handicaps, being female put many more obstacles in my path than being black. I also see lefties who support Bernie using RW talking points, thuis rewarding the RW smear machine. See here: http://thedailybanter.com/2016/01/hillary-gop-smears/ "If You&apos;re Liberal and You Think Hillary Clinton Is Corrupt and Untrustworthy, You&apos;re Rewarding 25 Years of GOP Smears"

Please explain how you know that much Hillary hatred is misogyny...?  And how funny (and really pathetic) that you believe that the non-misogynists are stupid Republican dupes.  My dear, either you are white and well off economically and don&apos;t give a shit about real change or you&apos;re the fool.

I appreciate your not suggesting that my dislike for Mrs. Clinton is based on misogyny. My physician, surgeon, oncologist, and radiation oncologist are all women and would be astonished to find me so accused. Likewise, as a socialist for the last forty-seven years, I am not likely to take my cues from fascist critiques of Mrs. Clinton. But consider this: does it strike you odd that sexism is so often accused by your camp, but antisemitism has never been accused by my camp? Why is that?

To discuss why Sanders is not getting more of the African American vote is one thing but to suggest that his campaign or followers are racist working class uneducated white guys is ludicrous. A large part of the Sander&apos;s movement are young well educated folks who are the most accepting of people from all walks of life than any other campaign. This is the future of the party that is past identity politics. Whether or not the U.S. is systemically racist is a stupid conversation, of course it is, but lets talk about how to change that, which by the way the status qou has done nothing to address. Let middle of the road Democrats and Conservatives discuss social issues, they have been decided: you are on the correct side of history in terms of supporting civil rights, LBGT rights, and human rights or you are an idiot, period. The real question to discuss is how do we make the system better for the people. That is what the Sanders campaign is about.

There are so many things wrong with this piece it is hard to know where to begin. To try and make the Democratic primary race into a racial issue is insulting,  ludicrous and a cheap shot.. First, Joan just basically called the progressive movement racist. Which would include the many intelligent, well informed Black, Latino, Asian, Native American, etc. voters who have rallied to Bernie&apos;s call for a more inclusive, participatory society and a leveling of the playing field for the disenfranchised. When Clinton ran against Obama they were essentially similar mainstream, "moderate", corporate, Clintonian Democrats. That&apos;s why so many Clintonites ended up in the Obama administration. This election is not about two similar politicians - one white and one black, but rather about two radically different politicians. Bernie has had to fight against the corrupt DNC at every turn, while  accepting no tainted big money contributions.  Joan says " Making speeches to Wall Street for a quarter-million a pop also cost her white working-class street cred—as it should. ", once again turning a non racial issue into a racial issue and treating as a side point the real point - that while championing campaign finance reform and reigning in corporate Americas&apos; excessive influence ( by the infusion of huge amounts of money), on American politics, out of one side of her mouth, Hillary is catering to corporate America and begging for their money, out the other.  Anyone who suggests that when powerful individuals, organizations and corporations give you vast amounts of money, you don&apos;t owe them for it, is truly naive and clueless or you think I am.

 So how about some more real issues?  What about the issue of Hillary&apos;s hawkish tenure as Secretary of State: pushing for regime change in Libya, which totally destabilized the region? Now like a bad reoccurring neo-con nightmare she preaches regime change in Syria, apparently to fulfill the George W - Dick Cheney "5 in 8" plan (5 regime changes in 8 years: Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan and IRAN).  Only the timing is different; Her disgraceful behavior in aiding in the military over throw of the legally elected, legitimate president of Honduras and immediately recognizing the illegitimate new govt., opening that poor Central American country to what has been described as a multinational corporate rape?  Good business for her corporate friends. What about her disgraceful boot-licking of AIPAC yesterday, equating the divestment movement and  protests against the apartheid policies of the extreme right wing govt.of Israel to antisemitism and again more sabre rattling against Iran.?

I could go on, but the point I&apos;m trying to make is that you trivialize the real issues and the difference between establishment, corporate, "liberal" democrats and true "progressive"democrats and independents, when you try to make the democratic race a racial or gender issue. The Clinton&apos;s have invested many years of effort, great amounts of money and a lot of political favors to build their infrastructure in the South, as well as the full backing of the mainstream Democratic machine.  As Cornell West has pointed out ,there is also an entrenched, establishment, black political hierarchy in the Democratic party that early on came out for Hillary.  Bernie has been fighting an uphill battle, in a virtual media blackout, slowly increasing his share of the Black vote and endorsements from  notable progressive black leaders like Cornell West. He also has overwhelming support in the Muslim community (70+% in Michigan), the Native American community, the Central American Latino community ( especially since the assassination of Berta Caceres and Nelson Noe Garcia Lainez ) and Progressive Independents of all sex, race or gender ( who were not allowed to vote in the Democratic primary in Ohio, thus the lopsided vote for Hillary ).  Millennials tip heavily toward Bernie, while older whites tip toward Hillary ( so maybe it&apos;s old verses new).  Older white women tip heavily to Hillary, while millennial women tip  toward Bernie ( so maybe the young don&apos;t look to Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright for advice, and can see past the gender issue).  Just as an aside, I never thought I&apos;d live to see the day (63 years old) that any Democrat would use Henry Kissinger as a character and job reference.  Or that I would hear "progressive" women singing the praises of Margaret Thatcher  I will not apologize when I say that an overwhelming number of Americans are uninformed, under-informed or misinformed due to the tragic state of the corporate news/entertainment media.  So I would suggest that as American voters become more informed, the progressive ranks will swell with people of all races.

 Bernie has been criticized that his message is too generic and that he doesn&apos;t spend enough time addressing the specific  problems of the black community.  I know that he is trying to correct this misconception ( he has an outstanding civil rights record).  But, I believe he purposely keeps his message aimed at the largest possible audience, not to ignore the specific plight of any individual group, but rather to keep his movement as all inclusive as possible.  After all, we are the 99% and it will take a large, diverse movement to make any kind of substantive change.  Hillary tells you what SHE will do, while Bernie talks about what WE can do.  I&apos;m not going to claim that he hasn&apos;t made mistakes and occasionally been on the wrong side of some issues.  But, he"s honest and consistent in his attempts to improve the well being of the oppressed, to attack the corrupt corporate infrastructure in America and to not go marauding around the world on one military misadventure after another.

  Joan has apparently backed Hillary both times she&apos;s run, although she somehow made it sound like she switched sides.  Having read some of her most recent articles, if I wanted to take a cheap shot ( like accusing the Sanders campaign of racism or sexism ) I could accuse the author of sexism and suggest that her support for Hillary is only because she&apos;s a woman, but like I said, that would be a cheap shot.

The underlying presumption is that Sanders in 16 is just Clinton in 08. If one sets out from that presumption, then it&apos;s "reasonable" to conclude that Sanders must take a lesson Clinton already took.

The problem, obviously, is that no such analogy can be made. Sanders is not, never was and never will be Hillary Clinton in any way, shape or form. 

But so what, some would ask? This is about the party more than the candidates. No, it&apos;s not, and even were it, a lot has changed since the first African American was elected, though there is some analogy from the identity politics standpoint.

If this is about electing the first woman president, there&apos;s nothing Sanders can do. But if it&apos;s not about that, and let&apos;s hope it&apos;s not, and if it&apos;s not about fantasy either, which is more problematic, then I see no problem for Sanders. His strategy for winning greater numbers of black votes in places like California will prove correct and with that he most certainly can win the nomination, and then more easily beat the fascist party&apos;s nominee whether Trump (likely to self-detonate) or Cruz.

But sure, if once again it&apos;s going to be about identity politics, then the left (and/or minorities) will lose again, thanks in no small part to Hillary Clinton, of whom it is absurd to claim was ever the populist Sanders is.

The elephant in the room is something we all tread so delicately around, namely that the church social set of the African American community has sold its soul and its vote all too cheaply to a couple that has wreaked considerable damage upon their community. Martin Luther King would be appalled at the ease with which Mr. Clinton seduced that community in the first place and the entitlement with which Mrs. Clinton enjoys its continued devotion.  All too often King&apos;s name is invoked as a benevolent saint from the distant past rather than as the democratic socialist he came to be in his later years. In 1966 King said this to his associates: "Now this means that we are treading in difficult waters, because it really means that we are saying there is something wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America needs to move toward a democratic socialism." That was in 1966, when income inequality in the nation was in no way comparable to the horrid inequality of the present day. This theme found even more explicit expression in "The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism".  And again, "Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God&apos;s children." King saw that the struggle must proceed on all fronts: against racism, of course, but also, and equally against militarism, and finally against the egregious income inequality engendered by capitalism. Were King still with us, there would be little doubt with which candidate he would ally himself. He would certainly not stand with the candidate who surrounds herself with Wall Street profiteers, war criminals, those who follow solely for the sake expected advancement, and those who confuse the most audacious influence peddling scheme in America&apos;s history for the Promised Land.

Yes, you did indeed identify the elephant in the room. If King were alive today, I do believe very few African Americans would support him. We know in the last year or so of his life when he began to critique America&apos;s militarism, capitalism, and racism, black leaders, ministers, and lay folks deserted him. They criticized him for being and speaking like a democratic socialist. Sadly, one of black folks&apos; biggest mistakes is allowing identity politics dictate who we should support. Obama didn&apos;t deliver as they had hoped, but they will never say so. Now they support the Clintons (and yes, it will be the return to a co-presidency) because cunning Hillary is running on Obama&apos;s presidency--a presidency that was flawed in a number of ways, but African Americans, the Democratic Party&apos;s most loyal constituents (who are continuously used and abused) will not openly admit their disappointments.

Hillary Clinton spent 6 of her last 8 years working with Obama in his cabinet selling his foreign policy around the world.  The idea that it is somehow dishonest of her or wrong for her to embrace his presidency is ridiculous: is she supposed to run away from her resume?  her own work?  her own commitments?  It is not just Obama&apos;s legacy she is running on but her own.
Bernie supporter&apos;s love this false argument because when she embraces her work with Obama she is highlighting her foreign policy advantage over Bernie: it highlights the fact that Bernie has no experience and no interest in foreign policy, something his supporters hate to admit too either.
The idea that King would not be as popular today is a sad and perverse thought; that said, though, lets look at the love and acclaim that John Lewis has today.  Doesn&apos;t Lewis&apos;s support and power let us know that King&apos;s support and embrace would be akin to Mandela&apos;s too?  The wrongheadedness of the &apos;elephant in the room&apos; argument here in some reader&apos;s comments lends credibility to Walsh&apos;s assertions about Sander&apos;s followers: they just don&apos;t get it.  They just do not see the problem with how blacks have voted in this primary fight, with what it says about their candidate, with how bad it is to suggest that blacks are low information voters who do not understand their own interests.

You are so very, very, right, Mr. Currier, I just don&apos;t get it. I do not, repeat, do not get how a whole generation of the community abandoned the clear and noble ideals espoused by Dr. King soon before he, too, walked alone into the Garden of Gethsemane. I do not understand how the noble fighting spirit of Dr. King gets portrayed as a warm and cuddly feel-good cardboard saint. I do not understand how complacency muffled the cry for justice. I do not understand the transformation of candidate Obama into President Obama. I do not understand why Hillary Clinton, duped by Cheney & Co. was chosen as Secretary of State. Was it because of the wisdom of her vote for war in Iraq? Was it because she ducked bullets getting off the plane in Bosnia? Was it because she idolized Henry Kissinger? I mean, Henry Kissinger, deposer of democratically elected heads of state, bomber of the innocents?? What made her so qualified??? Why would the President endanger the world with someone who would maniacally boast "We came. We saw. He died." What was this deal with the devil? What was this deal that offered this nation, this world as collateral??? You are right, Mr. Currier, I just don&apos;t get it.

The real question is why has The Nation even hired Joan Walsh? There are so many good writers to choose from who are so much more attuned to what is going on today.

*thinks* ‘great – here’s my chance to curry favor with Joan and maybe she’ll follow me on Twitter’ haha
No, seriously,  Mr Cullen, there are few writers as tuned in to what’s going on today, or who were as tuned in to whatever was going on at any given time throughout the last thirty-plus years, as Joan Walsh. Would you be faulting her on that score if she happened to be a Bernie supporter? I doubt it. As it is, she’s perfectly entitled to choose her preferred candidate and, unlike the numerous graduates of the Boo/Hooray schools of punditry, she can always provide good reasons for the choices she makes. Which, I assume, is why the Nation hired her. Good for them.

It&apos;s always good to have dissenting voices, but I disagree with your claim that Walsh always provides good reasons for the choices she makes.   I&apos;ve never heard her make a positive case for Hillary.  I&apos;ve said this before, sorry to be repetitive, but she&apos;s indicated that she&apos;s for Clinton because she&apos;s a woman; people have been mean to her and to Walsh for supporting her; there&apos;s a Republican conspiracy against her; and sexism.

Didn’t say  she always provides them; said she can always provide them. The positive case for Hillary is to be found in many of her articles in Salon and elsewhere (including here in The Nation), for anyone with the time to trawl through them, but even in the present article she explains how in ’08 she supported HC because she was to the left of Obama on many domestic issues. “Her healthcare plan covered everyone; Obama’s left at least 15 million unprotected. She railed against growing evidence of bad banking behavior, even before the crash, coming out for a foreclosure moratorium, for the regulation of derivatives and for closing the “carried interest” loophole that privileged investment banking. Obama supported none of these proposals and, even running against the New York senator, he became the preferred candidate of Wall Street.” (There was also the further fact that in her time in the Senate HC was rated a more liberal senator than Obama.) Since then, the candidate hasn’t changed - except for the better. Thanks in part to Bernie, no doubt about that, she’s moved left, and as JW writes again in the present article, she has listened to African American voters, now the reliable base of the Dem party, in ways that, she argues, BS hasn’t. “She listened to African-American friends and onetime supporters, who explained why her appeals to “hardworking Americans, white Americans” sounded like, and may actually have been, racist dog whistles. She went to work for Obama when he asked her to, as his loyal secretary of state. She mended fences with former allies like South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who fell out with the Clintons over their perception that he’d favored Obama, though he’d technically stayed neutral in the primary; this year, he set aside neutrality to back Clinton. She also learned to do electoral math the way the Obama team did it. Once she decided to run, she put aside thoughts of reassembling the (Bill) Clinton coalition, with its emphasis on winning back working-class whites by offering “toughness” on issues like welfare and crime. Her first speeches as a candidate dealt with voting rights, mass incarceration, and immigration reform, a sign that she knew she had to consolidate the Obama coalition before thinking about a new (Hillary) Clinton coalition.” So JW&apos;s positive case for Clinton, seems to me (although obviously she could lay it out and sum it up much better herself), is that she would be a politically effective, liberal president, if perhaps in danger of being too hawkish in foreign policy, who would do much for women and POC. Add to this the cultural/symbolic value of having a woman in the WH (no small thing) and there’s a case for Hillary that any rational person would be justified in choosing. But I myself am still neutral. Bernie&apos;s a good guy.

They hired her not only because she is a goof writer but also because she is attuned and speaks to the complications of our political life unlike those seduced by the talk of the "revolution" that Sanders seems to use every time he is asked a specific and complication questions about how he is to achieve the utopia that he promises to his supporters.

How will Hillary achieve the teeny tiny changes she wants to make?  I haven&apos;t heard her specify her strategy?  Republicans hate her; how could she get even small changes through Congress.  (Of course her plans for more warring will thrill Republicans.

And BTW (sorry I keep repeating this too), Sanders can achieve big changes without Congress via his cabinet appointments and the way they write and enforce rules and regulations.   You know Hillary will give us more of the same:  Wall St. and industry insider foxes to guard the hen house.

I&apos;d like to move on to the question that the author, and about all of the commenters, seem to be ignoring: how can Clinton, and also how can Sanders, win the national election, in particular if it is against a demagogue who makes a strong (though flawed) pitch to the white working class?

Seems challenging, but weekly polls consistently indicate that both could beat Trump, Sanders by more.  Those same polls indicate that Sanders would easily beat Cruz...and that Hillary will lose to Cruz.

I’m a member of the “(go figure)” crowd – those incomprehensible African Americans who have voted or will vote for Sanders (I will do so during the California primaries). I read his platform, examined his voting record, weighed his vision against Clinton’s, and determined he spoke for (appealed to!!) me. I don’t give a damn whether or not he marched with King. Nor am I impressed with Clinton’s visits to black churches or her invitations to us (like she offered in Flint recently) to imagine what would happen if the injustices visited upon black people were visited upon white people (the answer is obvious and does not a policy make).

Like a lot of black people (believe it or not), I care about increasing economic and social inequality, the continued plundering of our treasury by the wealthy, our broken criminal justice system, endless war and our incomprehensible, unconscionable involvement in the Middle East, the neocon hunger for a new Cold War with Russia, our separate and unequal schools, segregation, poverty, the injustices of our immigration policies and the xenophobia that drives them, ridiculous tuition costs, free trade that is patently unfair to working people here and abroad, policies and laws passed to make it difficult for workers to organize, the assault on reproductive rights, unequal pay for women, mass incarceration, our crumbling infrastructure, the immoral failure on our part to address – to take real responsibility – for climate change, Citizens United, the gutting of the VRA….
Now, to the degree we want to conflate blackness with particular issues, let’s just agree that these are “black” issues by virtue of the fact that I am black. Consequently, to address them is to appeal to black people.

I’d rather us get beyond that, however, and ask: what (entrenched) interests are served when we declare that to speak about some issues is to speak to black [white] people, but to speak about others is to be tone deaf to African American [white] concerns? How are those interests served by the narrowing of the terms by which African Americans and others debate and frame (usually in “identity” terms) the plethora of issues that affect our lives? Who benefits, what’s the payoff? (I am reminded, for some reason, of MLK’s complaint that those who criticized him for veering off of civil rights and speaking about Vietnam in effect wanted him to “segregate” his “moral concerns.” In other words, folks were telling him that he needed to shut up about Vietnam because foreign policy wasn’t black people’s business. Something of that lurks in the current discussions about black voters).

Sanders’ “failure” to reach, not African Americans as a category, but African Americans in large numbers, may hinge in part on his failure to deftly navigate the implications of such questions. I assume it also hinges, in part, on a lack of information  – driven in great measure by how the media does or does not cover and frame Sanders. And then there is just the reality that some African Americans are entirely comfortable with, and have made a reasoned political choice to embrace, Clinton’s neoliberal politics.

Imagine that.

Well written. Thanks.

Dear  Bernie enthusiasts: keep the faith, believe and get out there and shout;  wake up America and maybe we can turn the tide in Bernie&apos;s favor...... lots of voting still to go say shout loudly.

With the sole exception of Arkansas (when Bill Clinton was running), the southern Democrats have not delivered a single electoral vote in any presidential election in decades.  So who cares?

By that logic I guess Obama&apos;s 2008 primary wins should have been discarded, and allowed Hillary to become the nominee.   Or are southern states only to be ignored when your favored candidate doesn&apos;t carry them?

I think he was talking about the Presidential General elections, not the primaries. Democrats don&apos;t win the South in the general election.

In case you weren&apos;t aware Joan ... readers already knew you were in the tank for Hillary long ago, so your words here will not change the mind of any of Bernie&apos;s supporters.

The major error of this piece is the claim that the Sanders campaign aimed to only woo white working class voters. Let&apos;s see ... his first two Congressional endorsements were people of color. His leading surrogates on the campaign trail (Cornel West, Nina Turner, Killer Mike) are all people of color. He went on a campaign tour through historically black colleges. He toured his record of fighting for civil rights. He put together arguably the most comprehensive criminal justice platform of any candidate. How is this in any way a campaign trying to only woo white working class voters? Whatever the reasons the campaign hasn&apos;t won over African Americans, particularly in the South, it certainly wasn&apos;t been due to a lack of effort.

The corollary error is that the Clinton campaign did reach out in more substantive ways. The only evidence given in this pieces is that she "mended fences" with some black politicians and spoke of racial justice issues in her speeches. Bernie spoke extensively of racial justice in his speeches, and he had no metaphorical fences to mend, so this amounts to a distinction without a difference.

Another error is that Clinton&apos;s white working-class strategy of 2008 cost her the black vote. Don&apos;t forget that she was winning the black vote until Obama started winning (mostly white) states like Iowa. Their switch to Obama had little to do with what Clinton did or did not do and almost everything to do with what Obama meant to them symbolically. She did eventually shift her campaign to appeal to more white working-class voters, but this was only after and because Obama began capturing the black vote -- Walsh has the cause and effect reversed.

Yes, of course, we need to build multi-racial progressive coalitions. And yes, we need to ask why the Sanders campaign hasn&apos;t done better with people of color. Unfortunately, this piece doesn&apos;t offer answers that hold up to scrutiny.

I am inspired by Sanders and disgusted by Clinton. Her support for African-Americans is, or was, genuine when I was in Arkansas, and she did many good things. But she is a member of a group with a lot of bad economic goals and poor foreign policy agendas. Sanders&apos; main hurdle is not absentee blacks. It is his starting from behind and not yet appealing to them. African-Americans wear justifiably their hearts on the sleeves, subject to unfairness from whites at any time. I understand this. Distrust within the African-American community also makes them (I like to call them "us" not "them.") prone to manipulation by seemingly sympathetic supporters, even demagogues.

“He had his best night with black voters in Missouri (go figure), where he won 32 percent.”
I can never resist a “go figure,” but unfortunately all I can come up with is the rather obvious: Perhaps members of the black community in Missouri are more radicalized because of Ferguson, so they like Bernie’s talk of a revolution. They feel that’s what it will take. 
Also in need of a “go figure” is why Bernie won Democrats Abroad by about two to one, even in countries, like Britain and Germany, that are familiar with women leaders. France also went for Bernie by about two to one overall, but in some cases (eg, Paris and Toulouse) by almost three to one. Might be the (mostly) socialized medicine but also, some Bernie voters dining in the Saveurs Bio restaurant in Toulouse said they would have gone for Hillary if Chelsea and Bill had stuck to a vegan diet instead of switching to low-carb. (Saveurs Bio is a vegetarian restaurant.) As is so often the case, it’s not the position per se - Sanders is also a meat eater - but the flip flop.
Final random thought: The lately beatified Joe Biden, who was much more battle-hardened in the ways of Washington than the new president, was also ready to go for the Grand Bargain, spouting the typical Golgothic bromide: There’s no point in being nailed to a small cross.

Hmm...Yes, of course white independents are up for grabs for Hillary.  That&apos;s exactly the point and you practically said it yourself (well definitely not blatantly) that Hillary will say whatever that specific group wants to hear to get their vote.  Bernie&apos;s genuine and honest demeanor doesn&apos;t get past everyone and I&apos;ve seen that the more people hear his message and feel compelled to vote for someone who tells the truth then the more people stand with him.  If he was given more of a half second of time to share that message then I believe he would be winning.  Good thing his people are hitting the streets trying to move as fast as they can to share it with him.  His strategy may not be in the lead but Hillary has been working towards this for 8 years (or more) with every huge network and corporation behind her.  When Americans have to dig to really get to know a new candidate it doesn&apos;t leave a lot of space for resounding success. The fact that Bernie&apos;s come from left field and given her a run for her money with none of the establishment backing him shows me that maybe her strategy and electability is actually very questionable.  It feels like a set up to elect her and I feel that more and more people will be waking up in the next few months as it continues.  Once people have a door opened to the truth it is difficult for them to not want to walk in to that door.  Win or lose, Sanders comes out victorious for giving us a roadmap to get engaged and lifting the veil on DC shenanigans.  That won&apos;t dissappear on us anytime soon.  Yet many of the promises she&apos;s flip flopped on as a candidate will disappear sooner.   It may take another 4 years for a majority to realize that but it seems apparent they will... No matter what their race or gender.  Here&apos;s to hoping not though because, as great as would be to have a woman president, it would be much better to have someone who has ignited a shift in our thinking with his honesty and real policies for the environment, wars, and inequality that will steer us to where we need to be ...Let&apos;s go Bernie!

The title is really harsh, it sounds like you&apos;re talking about Bernie&apos;s complete campaign. But really you&apos;re talking about how he could be more effective with the South, which is less wealthy and educated than its northern and western neighbors.
It&apos;s a tricky job, since Hillary has been in the news for so much longer. Hopefully he figures out a way to connect since he has already done a lot more and would be amazing!

Joan ignores Latinos.  And young PoC everywhere.  She&apos;s spinning the "Bernie so white" meme.  She hopes it becomes wish fulfillment.  She is a Clitonista.

And bringing up the Bernie Bros. crap again. And a sexist behind every tree AGAIN. How about Joan&apos;s candidate proclaiming the Reagan&apos;s heroes of the AIDS crisis?

Sad subliminal message again from Joan Walsh of Bernie as racist. Pathetic.

Brilliant analysis. I hope Bernie&apos;s campaign reads this!

Glen Ford over at Black Agenda Reports gives his explanation of Black voting behavior. In one word: fear.
http://blackagendareport.com/victor_of_fear_blacks_and_dems#comment-27792

Same as white voters for Trump. In that case, fear of being marginalized by POC.  At the end of the day, people are the same deep down.

My sentiments are in step with Mr. Brunoli&apos;s first sentence.  All I could say from seeing the title of this spun piece until its conclusion was "Wow".  Doesn&apos;t Joan think that Obama&apos;s support, almost all of the Democratic figureheads from state to state (especially black leaders Lewis, Clyburn etc.), the corporate media (where else do people get their information) and the way they have discredited his ideas as pie in the sky...the list could go on and on - have influenced hordes of voters to support Hillary, ultimately against their own interests (in my view).  They can put their trust in her all they want but her populism is simple to see through.  Nobody argues with her skill as a politician and shrewdness as a debater, and the Super Pac support she&apos;s backed by wields tremendous influence..  And her below the belt snide halftruths about Bernie&apos;s positions are well timed.  I liked his statement recently that he should have copyrighted his speeches. Big Pharma and Insurance(good luck with single payer or anything else that helps poor/formerly middle class folks afford coverage)- Big Oil (lets frack and frack some more)- Wall Street (why free tuition when we can suck the life out of kids from families who aren&apos;t connected and score huge profits leaving many stuck with a lifetime of debt) - Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Bechtel etc - (regime changes, perpetual conflict, even the war on ISIS was recently called a huge growth area by an unnamed executive not to mention auditing the bloated defense budget). Shareholders of all of the above don&apos;t seem to mind business as usual either, especially if their earnings are taxed at lower rates than the working stiffs.  The inroads Bernie has made despite this tapestry of well entrenched support for Hillary are nothing short of phenomenal and the tone of the criticisms I&apos;ve heard mocking his platform seem to be less pompous as more and more people hear him speak.  Sure the Dems want him to pack his bags and call it quits - the issues she&apos;s pretending to fight for can melt quietly into the background. People have short memories.  Watching the way the Democrats have handled this entire campaign has been eye opening and very disappointing.  Maybe all of the turned off millennials will be the start of a long overdue third party in American politics.  Imagine that.

What&apos;s Wrong With The Nation&apos;s Strategy? Back in the 1970s & 1980s, The Nation (along with The Village Voice) were the magazines I consistently went to for cultural & political analysis.  In the past 2 decades, however, The Nation has gone down the tubes.  There is no regular contributor today who writes with as much verve and wit as there were in the days of Nat Hentoff & Alexander Cockburn. The Nation has become a sounding board for banal liberals, who find every way to justify the status quo of Washington & the DNC. And no writer epitomizes the downfall of The Nation more than Joan Walsh.  Every sentence is a complete fabrication of Joan&apos;s imagination and without any citations or actual evidence to back up such claims:
"﻿ In 2016, once again, throughout most of the primary campaign, there’s been a black candidate and a white candidate" - No there is not. There is a male candidate and there is a female candidate. There is a Christian and there is a Jew.  Bill Clinton was not the first black president, and his playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall didn&apos;t make him cool or down with the working class either...and no academic "analysis" can change that fact. Likewise, Hillary will not be the first black woman president either. Her black "support"  comes from name recognition alone & playing her usual tricks like bringing out someone from the Civil Rights era to present a false image of Bernie&apos;s participation in the Civil Rights & deflecting attention from The Goldwater Girl&apos;s support of a candidate who opposed Civil Rights. 
"﻿ Bernie Sanders is going to eventually have to take in that reality. As he saw his hopes in the South crushed by black voters"- No his hopes weren&apos;t crushed, he probably didn&apos;t expect to get much headway in the South without the free advertising that Hillary gets & the MSM blackout on covering Bernie. When did Bernie ever express any expectation to win the South? He most likely had to find a way to maximize as many votes with the limited time & resources he had & figured a locally-based door-to-door ground campaign in the South was not doable & so he tried to strengthen his support among the educated in those areas & devote more of his effort to those places he had a stronger  chance of winning. 
"﻿ Well, he did do better in Michigan. He won the primary, and he got 28 percent of the African-American vote, as opposed to 5 to 25 percent in other states. That was widely hailed as an improvement; it really shouldn’t have been." - Yes it should have Joan, Bernie was given no chance whatsover of capturing more than 10% of any voters, irrespective of which demographic group, one year prior. So for Bernie, who has had little to no coverage in the MSM, to gain that much is an improvement was an achievement.  And , as is true among many white liberals who try to portray themselves as enlightened bearers of critique in a multiracial America, Joan completely ignores other demographic groups (namely Muslims & Latinos) to make a very small (and incorrect) assertion when it suits her purpose. 
"﻿ The sexism of the so-called BernieBro ..." - The term "Bernie Bro" was coined by Hillary&apos;s PR staff to go negative on someone (a male) who was a strong supporter of women&apos;s issues without actually having to size up both candidates&apos; records on the issues. How is it that a woman who was appointed to Walmart&apos;s board of directors because of its poor record on women&apos;s issues would go on to do nothing for the improvement of actual working women at Walmarts (such that Obama would have to propose the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act) become a champion of women&apos;s issues? That&apos;s it, point to the existence of "Bernie Bros." & deflect attention away from the issues again....
I could go on like this for each and every sentence, but I&apos;ve tired of arguing with clueless liberals after this election. There really is something at stake in this primary. It&apos;s probably the only time in my lifetime that I will ever get to vote for a candidate for president who isn&apos;t a war criminal and who would actually do something for working families.  So it&apos;s particularly galling to see wealthy white liberals who claim to support working folk sabotage that possibility. So would the editors of The Nation tell me again why they endorsed Bernie, only to fill the pages of The Nation & the website with accomodationist tripe? I guess I will have to "unlike" The Nation, as I did The New Yorker, New York Magazine, NYT, Mother Jones, etc. on Facebook, as it&apos;s turning out to be just another elite rag spewing the same garbage, and not even with any better analysis to boot.

Short version:  You&apos;ll only support magazines that tell you what you want to hear.  And therein lies the eternal problem of the American Left.  Never mind that The Nation supports Sanders and has run many articles and analyses in favor of him----if every writer isn&apos;t following in lockstep, you&apos;re outta here!

Andy, It is not about an author following my views in lock step. My problem with Walsh is the same one I have with Hillary: they present arguments not based on the facts and twist reality and history to win. And what do you win when you win with manipulations and distortions of reality and hiding the truth of HC&apos;s loyalty to Wall Street Etc. ?  Nothing worth having. 

Transparency is an absolutely essential element of democracy! If Walsh really believed in democracy she would be demanding that HC release the GS transcripts. Until she does that it is clear that Walsh wants a win and doesn&apos;t care if it&apos;s for a corporate hustler as long as it is her corporate hustler. Walsh to me is a  neo-progressive. Someone who claims progressive positions and ignores progressive values like truth and transparency when necessary to win. 

And the argument that HC is the most qualified exposes Walsh&apos;s and others bourgeoisie orientation. The first and foremost qualification for any position, especially president, if you are truly a progressive political person, is the candidate&apos;s dedication to Main Street over Wall Street,  peace over war, etc. Bernie  meets that requirement and HC,   with her Super PACS and tens of millions of dollars in corporate donations and speaking fees every year, doesn&apos;t come close. 

I do not know how any self-respecting person can tolerate and support a candidate that withholds crucial information.  Not to mention one who lies about her opponents history. Has Walsh and others that see themselves as progressives become so jaded that they accept dishonest statements, manipulations of history and conscious anti-transparency as "just a part of the game"?  Politics is much more than a game. Peoples lives and well being, and the survival of our planet hang in the balance.

I also was surprised that Joan gave no significance to the impact of name-recognition in the South as Bill was dubbed "the first black president".  Add in the lack of media coverage by the corporate media and support of the DNC and the outcome is obvious.  I was also very disappointed that the most serious issue difference was not mentioned here--that HRC is a hawk (note her AIPAC speech).  We need to stop playing "king maker" and disrupt the policy influence of the military-industrial complex, before it leads to the next war.

Are you aware that The Nation is one of the few medial outlets that ENDORSED Sanders???  It would seem not.

If you had read my comment completely, you would see that I acknowledged that fact at the end & asked "why?"......  The Nation&apos;s endorsement is completely undermined by the endless musings of writers who say little more than "but she&apos;s a woman!".

The author of this artical, adly is stuck in her abstaractions and in her focus on the Democratic party and pretty much missing what this election os about. She sees it as a contest of control and supports what seems to her like the most likely candidate to win control of the party. She is boxer, who apparers to believes that, like Mohanmid Allie did against George Forman, the candidate that tweaks the rules the best will win the power. But this is street combat and survival of the species and the U.S. as a viable power is at stake. She obviously is too comfortably cared for by the Advising media.

On the face of it, Bernie is for working people and people who need to work for a living and for anybody who lives on the planet because his agenda is realistic and pragmatic. While he may be a strategist, he maybe the only candidate for president who has put principle first for the whole of his public life.

The Western World created the the Middle East problem. Only Bernie recognizes that. The centralist politicians colluded with Wall Street to create the fall of American manufacturing and the near sighted degregulation of finanace the created the crash of 2008. Obama tied into that group and got us health care system the continues the redistribution of wealth upward, surely against his hopes.

Bernie is a break from the system the author knows and as so many, she can&apos;t seem to see outside her belief system. Sadly she is obviously pitching for Clinton and her editor allows it.

Walsh openly came out in favor of Clinton a couple months ago.

I have long listened to Brunch With Bernie on the Thom Hartmann show and have admired for many years his service to his constituents and the country as a whole. I began to note Clinton in the early 90s when her husband ran for president. I admired her work on health care reform, her work on women&apos;s issues, and her overall respect for diversity.  When Clinton ran against Obama in 2008, it wasn&apos;t until I was in the primary voting booth that I decided who to vote for.  I voted Obama. This year I had remained, until recently, undecided.  In my readings and viewings, I noticed an anti-Hillary (as opposed to pro-Bernie) brigade of sorts; to these dedicated followers of Sanders, Clinton is basically Donald Trump in drag. A fraud. A fake. A sociopathic corporatist.  She is, in effect, the same caricature presented to us by Fox and Rush and Hannity for the past 20 years. I found myself feeling silently defensive on Clinton&apos;s behalf. I am 55 years old. I lived and watched the 1990s and 2000s. I was there. While she certainly is a capitalist, she is none of what her detractors on the left (or the right for that matter) describe. I will still vote for either candidate in a general election, but tomorrow I will cast my pointless Arizona vote for Clinton.

Matthew, it is your right to be a chump.  She is a liar and war-monger with historically low approval rating ,which she shares with Trump

Hillary Clinton seemed to talk a lot more about her Christian faith in the last couple months while campaigning in the South than I&apos;d ever heard her speak about it before. Bill Clinton also mentioned it on a few occasions. It seemed strange. And led me to wonder if perhaps Sanders lost the Bible Belt in part because he is Jewish. Perhaps the Christian voters of the South aren&apos;t even conscious of their preference? Maybe so, maybe not.

I think religion played a huge role in how the South voted, but it was likely unconscious for most people. The thought process isn&apos;t so much "I won&apos;t vote for Bernie Sanders because he&apos;s Jewish" as it is "Hillary is like me, and she cares about the things I care about." People are mostly proud of their religion, and there&apos;s a strong identity associated with being a Christian—quoting the Bible is one of those things that automatically says "She&apos;s a believer, too. A dedicated follower and a woman of God." Religious identity is one of the most personal and sacred identities people have. It creates a feeling of community, and it creates a bond between Christians and the Clintons. Sanders just isn&apos;t a part of the club. (Although I&apos;m pretty sure that if he were a Christian, he would talk about God just as much as he does now, i.e. hardly ever)

If you care about addressing Climate Change, please reconsider your intent to vote for Clinton. Sanders is by far the stronger candidate on the issue and one of the reasons I believe that Millennials in particular are such avid believers in Bernie. They are the ones who must live on this planet much longer than either you at 55 years old or me at 46 years old. And this issue - the biggest one in my opinion - is also the reason in my view that so many Bernie supporters are so ardent. Clinton is a moderate. And that tactic may work with some or even many issues. But we need strong and serious action now if we are to stem Climate Change and prepare for what we cannot stem.  (btw my source for believing Bernie is stronger on addressing Climate Change is my reading both Bill McKibben and Naomi Klein&apos;s analyses of the two candidates).

I used to think that climate change was far and away the biggest issue we faced today. What could be more critical than the destruction of livable environments for humans and non-humans? (And so much more could be said about this issue.)
But Bernie hits on the really important issue: unglamorous campaign finance reform. As long as our leaders are beholden to billionaire owners of  fossil fuel companies alternative energy and conservation will not be on the agenda. Nor will we enact progressive solutions to any of the problems that we face.
Until we have one person one vote rather than one dollar one vote we will continue to march down the roads of failure and inequality.
And leading toward equality? Which candidate is well within the wealth and income of the 1%? And which is more comfortable with the super rich than with middle class people? It&apos;s simply obvious; it&apos;s hidden in plain sight.

Yes of course we need to get Big Money out of Politics. But if we were to stop there, our oceans would still rise.

If you see yourself as a progressive, you should take a more dispassionate look at the history of Hillary Clinton.  You cannot help but find a centrist war-hawk who maintains questionable and uncomfortable relationships with corporations and Wall St.  That won&apos;t change if she is the next occupant of the oval office.

Clearly a progressive couldn&apos;t support Clinton. There&apos;s the ties with Wall Street, a woman eager to send other women&apos;s children to war and a first lady who actually referred to African-Ameican men as "super predators with no conscience or empathy" Clearly the author is not a progressive.

What a pity that you let opposition to Bernie supporters, instead of being pro-Hillary and her policies, decide your vote.  Your reasoning perfectly mirrors the Bernie supporters you describe anti-Hillary rather than pro-Bernie.  (And BTW, since Hillary mostly gets a pass in the mainstream media, I think sometimes Bernie supporters feel desperate to get her actual record out there...and maybe sound like Hillary haters rather than just disliking her policies and history significantly.

Where the hell did this come from? (Besides the Hillary bias) Whoever says Bernie isn&apos;t attracting the Black and Latino vote should, for one thing, check out his staffers and volunteers...and you, Joan, should read Michelle Alexander&apos;s reasons why Afro-Americans should not support Hillary.

When you&apos;re like Walsh, experiencing no economic inequity and insecurity and no racial injustice, it&apos;s very very easy to support a symbol over someone flesh and blood who would fight for average Americans.  There&apos;s no point in pointing out to Walsh Hillary&apos;s history and the significant harm she&apos;s done to women, especially women of color, over the years.  Joan cares only about identity politics, and will have a woman president no matter what.

That&apos;s a pretty good reply at this point.  I&apos;m assuming you are a woman.  You are stating things that I&apos;m loathe to as a man, even though I am gay, I still get trepidation when coming close to talking someone like Walsh down.  But I see the same things. I quite like her but realistically, she spins in the world of writing for Salon magazine and gets to call all her own shots.  Right now she should probably STFU before people like myself get a serious Jones against her.   Moving into vile, she is.

I hate the term populist, I think that Bernie Sanders policies proposals are humanistic and to leave out of the picture the horrific foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton administration is just wrong. Bernie is a humanist, he truly respects freedom, Clinton is more of the same.

This article does not mention Native Americans. 

Bernie has held meetings with Native American leaders in Arizona, Washington and Kansas amongst other places and they are supporting him. 

In a town hall meeting on the Navajo Nation, Sanders said “From the first day that settlers came to this country, the Native American people have been lied to, they have been cheated, and negotiated treaties have been broken. We owe the Native American people so, so much.” What other candidate has acknowledged this, ever?  

The Coast Salish nation&apos;s tribal leaders just bestowed on him a name which translates as "The one who is lighting the fires for change and unity." 

And Native American Winona LaDuke has endorsed Sanders because she believes he is the best candidate for the interests of Native Americans and the Earth.

Joan Walsh writes that "the extent to which they&apos;ve ( working-class voters) abandoned Clinton this time around is surprising to me." But who abandoned whom? She supported NAFTA but she recently rejected her previous support for TTP. She flip-flopped but finally got it, that si, how disillusioned were working-class voters over the loss of their jobs caused by NAFTA and the Democratic Party. Only a journalist who identifies with Hillary would be surprised and get it wrong about who abandoned whom.

Joan, If Ms. Clinton &apos;built a constituency&apos; in 2008, she apparently left me out of it.

Joan, there are so many things just plain wrong with this article that I literally don&apos;t know where to begin. Firstly, to think that Hillary Clinton, who has amassed a $100 million dollar fortune through politics and her political connections, could ever appeal as an "FDR" style populist, is pure fantasy. Likewise, to think that the Senator who voted a straight DLC-backed neocon war agenda including the Iraq debacle could be populist is also naive at best. To believe that the "better half" of the political family that turned the Democratic Party into the poster-child for "pay to play" political corruption, who made the Democratic Party the Party of Wall Street and Corporate America, that put the DLC and the so-called "New Democrats" in charge, could EVER appeal to working class families who had even a modicum of perspicacity and informed opinion, is just crazy.
Yes, blacks support Hillary, but not for "populist" reasons - they support her because she has stood with them on civil rights issues and she has made extraordinary efforts over many years to ingratiate herself with black leadership. But blacks do not support Hillary because she is a defender of the working class, or because she sympathises with the fact that black folks lost 70% of their wealth due to Wall Street&apos;s greed. Black support this time around is more due to institutional strength and establishment fealty. To make comparisons between 2008 and 2016 in terms of "populist" appeal among black voters is facile at best. Black voters voted for Obama the same way that many women today are supporting Hillary. It was the politics of identity, not any sort of "populist" message, that is driving votes.
Bernie&apos;s message, his language, his approach and his whole persona is one of inclusion. This is a man, after all, who was arrested in 1963 because he chained himself to a black woman to protest segregation. He is all about civil rights. But he is also about economic rights. Bernie is more FDR-like than any candidate in the past 50 years, because he is channeling FDR&apos;s proposed "Economic Bill of Rights." That is the true populist message. But Bernie is offering a modern version of Roosevelt&apos;s compact, replete with criminal justice reform and a fight against institutional racism that has always been a part of the Sanders idiom.
Shame on you for trying to make a clever point at the expense of a fine man who is indeed our last, best hope for a true Democratic President in the tradition of FDR, LBJ and RFK. Theirs is a noble and populist tradition that the Clintons turned their back on and not only ignored but reversed in favour of triangulation and culture wars that still left the working people of this country hard done by.

Subtext – "Why can&apos;t I nail down how Bernie Sanders became the Energizer Bunny?"  Advice: put down your hammer, and put on your imagination hat. Because your third-eye appears to have a cataract.

Odd that the candidate who was arrested protesting for civil rights is accused of racism while the candidate who lobbied for a prison bill that included such progressive policies as three-strikes-your-out sentencing is racially in tune. The truth here seems much simpler;  Clinton has been campaigning for the presidency for 10 years and was in the public eye long before that. Sanders has been campaigning for  10 months, starting as a senator from a small state most people have never heard of (pun intended) and no money.  The fact that he has beaten her in several states and fought her to a draw in several others is testimony to two things; his strength as a candidate and her weakness as a candidate. If Clinton wins, with all of her money and institutional and media support and her 10 year head start, she has nothing to brag about...

this article was clearly written by the white establishment trying to promote the falsehood that Bernie is building a white coalition of working voters. The truth is when those other factions are given an opportunity by the democratic establishment, minorities and others jump to support Bernie. Which is why these false narratives are so important to the joan walsh establishment democrats. they keep voters from finding out how much Bernie is what they are looking for.

Joan, it&apos;s time you thought about the nation and the world beyond and outside of the Democratic Party, the party of FDR as you put. The picture is larger now and Sanders momentum is speaking to something beyond who gets the White House come January 2017. I am not white and as a person of color your obsessive observation of whiteness strikes as overly self-centered. True: class-based strategy will succeed in the US only if it organically incorporates race and gender issues and that IS a challenge, much bigger challenge than even winning the WH. Even bigger challenge, as Chomsky recently noted, is how to keep momentum and the movement going beyond November. Seen this way, your tireless advocacy of Hillary Clinton becomes rather irrelevant.

Completely agree.  This article completely misses the larger picture--and the heart of Bernie&apos;s mission.

It also misses the fact that Bernie wins the young vote by an 85% for the voters under 30; they are the future of the democratic party

The article makes it sound like Bernie has an intentional strategy to no include black voters. I don&apos;t think that is the case. Certainly he needs to do even more to make it clear that what he is saying applies to everyone. He needs to make his case that the biggest issues facing the black middle class are also the biggest issues facing the white middle class. But Bernie is not specifically ignoring black concerns. Or so it seems to me.

Totally agree: the misleading assumption here that Bernie has left Blacks out seems really weird.  Southern Blacks may be supporting Hillary, but that&apos;s not Bernie&apos;s agenda, which is deliberately and convincingly inclusive.
