The Senate on Thursday reached a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.1 billion in funding to fight the Zika virus, breaking a months-long standoff over how much spending is needed to address the growing public health threat.

The funding package was introduced as an amendment to a spending bill that is expected to be considered next week. Senators will also have the opportunity to vote on an option that would fully fund White House’s $1.9 billion request and a separate GOP-backed proposal that would use $1.2 billion in cuts to an Affordable Care Act program to offset the cost of $1.1 billion in Zika spending.

The compromise option, sponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), is expected to get widespread support from Democrats and Republicans, despite falling short of the White House request. The Senate is scheduled to vote on all three amendments Tuesday.

Democrats, including Murray, are expected to vote for the full funding option as well as the compromise to register their support for the White House proposal. Murray told reporters that her deal with Blunt is a good compromise.

“I am very glad that Chairman Blunt and I have been able to work together on an emergency funding bill to quickly respond to the Zika threat,” Murray said in a statement. “I continue to urge my colleagues to support the President’s full request, but I am very encouraged that Democrats and Republicans will be able to come together with a strong step forward to help ensure families across the country are prepared to respond to this emergency.”

The underlying spending bill, which combines funding for military construction and veterans programs with transportation and housing spending, is expected to easily pass the Senate late next week. The legislation faces a less certain fate in the House where Republicans have struggled to reach any agreement on a spending blueprint and have resisted White House calls for immediate action on its Zika request.

House Republicans argue the White House should be able to use funds leftover from battling the Ebola virus to combat Zika. The Obama administration has already tapped the Ebola funds, but continues to request additional funding.

Last month House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) criticized the administration for “refusing to provide basic budgetary information” on why they need more money to fight Zika. Rogers said he still needs to know “what is needed, right now, over the next five months in fiscal year 2016, to fight this disease?”

Some in the Senate hope that swift action and broad bipartisan support for the compromise will force House leaders to adopt a similar package, according to several aides. There is a strong chance that none of the individual spending bills that pass the Senate will ever become law, but aides said a Senate-passed Zika funding option could also easily be included in negotiations on a year-end spending bill.
