COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — This is not the best way to end a Republican state party convention.

Just moments after Colorado Republican Party Chairman Steve House announced the results of a day-long convention that awarded Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) 34 delegates to the Republican National Convention, the party's official Twitter account sent out a message suggesting party leaders were pleased with the results.

"We did it. #NeverTrump" the tweet said.

"It's not us!" a party spokesman shouted as he ran into a room full of reporters covering the convention. The tweet was immediately deleted — but not before reporters spotted it and took screen grabs:

The state party is investigating who might have sent the unauthorized message, which was sent just as the state's newly elected delegates began meeting in the basement of a hockey arena here for its first organizational meeting. 

 The last tweet was the result of unauthorized access to our account and in no way represents the opinion of the party. We are investigating.
