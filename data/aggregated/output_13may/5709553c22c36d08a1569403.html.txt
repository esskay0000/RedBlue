There are two kinds of math in the Democratic presidential race: delegate math and momentum math. Backers of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton prefer the delegate math, for obvious reasons. She has a solid lead in pledged delegates and, when superdelegates are added in, her advantage becomes overwhelming.

Backers of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders prefer the momentum math, for equally obvious reasons. Since March 22, Sanders has won six of seven state contests. He also dominated the “global primary” organized by Democrats Abroad.				
					
					
On Tuesday night, Sanders won a pivotal contest in the battleground state of Wisconsin, besting Clinton by a 57-43 margin. That was not quite the 58-41 margin that secured the state for Barack Obama when he faced Clinton in 2008. But it was close enough to have Sanders challenging the narrative that says he cannot win the Democratic nod.				
			

							“The corporate media and political establishment keep counting us out, but we keep winning...” —Bernie Sanders
						
 
“The corporate media and political establishment keep counting us out, but we keep winning states and doing so by large margins,” Sanders declared Tuesday night. “If we can keep this up, we’re going to shock them all and win this nomination.”				
					
					
Sanders won 71 of 72 Wisconsin counties, showing strength in urban, suburban, and rural areas. (Among the rural areas where the senator ran particularly well was Menominee County, where 87 percent of the residents are Native Americans and Sanders took 63 percent of the vote.)  In Milwaukee County, which was seen as Clinton’s base in the state, she did win; but the margin of 52-48 was far closer than in populous Dane County (Madison), where Sanders led 63-37. As in Michigan, where Sanders scored a surprise win in March, the senator won around 30 percent of the African-American vote. That was a stronger number than in several Southern states that voted in late February and early March. But it was still far less than the level of support for Clinton, who in Wisconsin campaigned with the support of popular Congresswoman Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee.				
					
					
Also, as in Michigan, trade was big issue in Wisconsin, with 60 percent of Wisconsinites who said that current trade policies harm the United States voting for Sanders, who vigorously opposes them.

For Sanders, it was a very big win in a state where both candidates mounted serious campaigns. And it yielded Sanders 45 pledged delegates to 31 for Clinton, according to the New York Times count. But Clinton still leads in the race for pledged delegates, with 1,295 for the former secretary of state to 1,066 for Sanders, according to the CNN count. And when superdelegates are added in, it’s Clinton’s 1,778 to Sanders’s 1,092. That’s something to brag about.				
					
					
But Sanders has a different kind of bragging rights. He says he’s got momentum, and as long as he maintains it—in a race that now heads toward the delegate-rich primaries in New York and beyond—that is also something to brag about. Arguing that the Wisconsin win “kicked off the most important three-week stretch of the campaign,” the senator told backers: “If we can keep our momentum going through the states that vote and caucus over the next three weeks, we’re going to win this election.”				
			

							“This is a close and competitive race that will be fought through all 50 states.” —Dan Cantor, Working Families Party
						
 
The hope of Sanders and his supporters is that their momentum math will ultimately influence the delegate math, by cutting Clinton’s pledged-delegate lead and convincing superdelegates to swing his way—as happened in 2008, when a number of superdelegates who were initially leaning toward Clinton ended up with Obama. That’s still a tall order. The great challenge with momentum math is that it requires a steady pattern of victories. Sanders has enjoyed that pattern in recent weeks. But now the race turns to New York and Pennsylvania, big, diverse states where polls give Clinton the advantage.				
					
					
But the scope of the Wisconsin win had a key Sanders backer in New York, Working Families Party Executive Director Dan Cantor, sounding optimistic. “The Sanders campaign knocked another chunk out of Secretary Clinton’s delegate lead tonight,” Cantor said Tuesday night. “After a convincing win, Sanders’ path to victory is becoming clearer than ever. The political establishment can no longer deny it: this is [a] close and competitive race that will be fought through all fifty states.”

CNN cut off Bernies&apos;s lengthy victory speech, of course. I, for one, was delighted with his win, and wonder how he did it when so many were denied the vote by the shameless Scott Walker, whom I will never understand how he got himself elected governor.

Bernie is the obvious choice, a man with a plan. I still have no idea what Hillary&apos;s plan is. Well, I know it will favor the 1%. And now she&apos;s claiming Sanders isn&apos;t qualified? Say what? She&apos;s lost whatever cool she had.

Now, John, about these "superdelegates", who are they and how is it they&apos;re allowed to decide who will be the nominee no matter the popular vote? What kind of loony party is this (capital, not small) Democratic one?

Hillary Clinton was interviewd on Morning Schmoe. Joe asked Hillary if Bernie was unqualified. She NEVER said he was unqualified. I saw the interview and if you care about the truth, you&apos;ll look for it. She did say he hadn&apos;t done his homework vis a vis the NYDN interview. And it&apos;s true, he wasn&apos;t prepared even though he&apos;s had a LOT of time to prepare. HE is the one bringing up the banks and should know the subject thoroughly. The fact is this: Bernie Sanders is just now starting to get vetted and he doesn&apos;t like it. That&apos;s ALL that this is about, make no mistake. He doesn&apos;t hold up under sustained questioning of his policies. And if you were paying attention, you&apos;d know his promises don&apos;t add up.

I agree that Bernie&apos;s performance at the NYDN tête-à-tête with its editors was a bit lame.  He got confused when an editor&apos;s questions repeatedly conflated  provisions in the Dodd-Frank legislation with the powers of the Federal Reserve. It is the Dodd Frank legislation which creates a framework for assessing which banks are Too Big to Fail.  The Federal Reserve has nothing to do with it. What appeared to be a rather tired Bernie didn&apos;t recognize the conflation, and it sounded like he didn&apos;t know what he was talking about, when he was confused by the questions themselves. Bernie introduced a bill in the House last year which lays out the goal and the means of compelling a breakup, based upon data obtained through  Dodd-Frank investigation and  monitoring .

One of those "Super Delegates" is a one William Jefferson Clinton.

When will the DNC (and Hillary) realize that what we need is both of them. Bernie has Hillary wayyy beaten on his vision for this country and the path he would take to get there, she does have much more foreign policy experience (although somewhat bellicose...) If either of them is really thinking of what is best for our ailing country they should both be able to come together and make an unbeatable (and very successful) ticket to ride!

What a syrupy sweet sentiment. But politics isn&apos;t sweet. It isn&apos;t polite. #NeverHillary

Some heartening parallels to Martin Luther&apos;s 1516 reformation of the Establishment Holy Roman Church.The sale of those pardons for sin that financed a corrupt and warring institution so infuriated the public that,like our outrage over the Wall Street&apos;s
blatant and unpunished thief,they rallied to the voice
that said,"Enough". Sanders&apos; is an Humanist savior.

Bernie Sanders has finally started to get media scrutiny and he falls apart immediately. Can you imagine what would have happened to HRC if she gave that horrible Daily News interview? I know the Nation and Bern Bros think they define the progressive movement but they do not. I am a progressive and do not in any way support the divisive smear campaign that Bernie is running. The Nation seriously risks its progressive credibility if it is going to continue to ignore the fact that we could have our first woman president. Continue to ignore that the Sanders campaign strategy is to override the will of the People by flipping super delegates. HRC has won overwhelming majority of minority and women voters. It takes a real exercise of hubris and white male privilege to say you deserve the nomination of a party you have never belonged to when you are losing by millions of votes. We saw what Bern supporters feel about minority voters with Tim Robbins&apos;s arrogant dismissal of South Carolina. Fact is that Hillary could win the South-stop silencing the voices of minority voters and poor voters across the South as if their voice doesn&apos;t matter because elitist liberal Bern supporters can drown them out on social media. Finally, Bernie is on the complete wrong side of the gun issue and his Sandy Hook comments were despicable. 

Bern and the Nation risk losing any progressive credentials if they keep treating Hillary this way. She has broad support among the minority and working class voters that have made the Democratic party strong.

Please see an informative New York Times piece which addresses Bernie&apos;s knowledge of about breaking up the Too Big to Fail banks: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/upshot/yes-bernie-sanders-knows-something-about-breaking-up-banks.html> 
I don&apos;t go much about the Bernie Bros, or how numerous they really are.  The enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders goes far and wide these days, with a large complement of women in the ranks of supporters.  As I see it, Bernie himself  mainly sticks to emphasizing the policies he favors, and avoids all of the mudslinging that characterizes the Republican campaigns.  I will certainly vote for Hillary if she wins the nomination, because I think she&apos;s as progressive as someone with her pedigree can be, and even if she weren&apos;t, between her and  Trump or Cruz it&apos;s a no-brainer.  Apparently a large majority of Bernie supporters feel the same way.  Granted, we will have to work hard to convince those who don&apos;t.  I expect Bernie will provide leadership in that direction.

Superdelegates do not represent the will of the people, but the will of the neoliberal Democratic party establishment.

We need to put the Sandy Hook gun issue into a reality prospective. I am a parent and have several nieces and nephews and a grandson on the way.  What happened at Sandy Hook made me sick and angry.  I am a lawyer that represents injured people for over 30 years. I also sit as an arbitrator and decide cases after hearing the evidence. If the guns that were used were legally manufactured and sold to a person legally, the shooters mother, there is no legal basis for suing the manufacturer or the retailer. The number of dead innocent women and children does not change that. Thousands of those guns have been sold and the buyers didn&apos;t kill anybody. If I had my way those type of guns wouldn&apos;t be sold but that is up to the congress and legislatures. Moral outrage, based on a horrible event, is not a basis for legal liability. We have to change the laws. Frivolous law suits hurt small businesses and unless there is some fact I don&apos;t know this law suit is frivolous. 

A perfect analogy: a man buys a car legally from a licensed car dealer, a new Chevy, and gets drunk and runs a red light and kills or injures many people. There is No legal basis for suing Chevrolet or the dealer that sold the car, regardless of the multiple dead and injured people caused by the DUI. 

The fact that Clinton, and here surrogates, are using this tragedy to gain points with sad families and people is a disgrace.

How are the super delegates representing the will of the people? Do You actually believe Hillary is a true progressive? She&apos;s closer to a Republican in many of her views.

"Elitist liberal Bern supporters"?  Who are they?  How is the Nation treating Hillary?  Are you trying to imply the the south isn&apos;t more conservative than the rest of the country?  How is Bernie on the wrong side of "the gun issue"?  And what "gun issue" are you talking about?  You sound mad because HRC is getting critiqued.  You want a woman president just because she&apos;s a woman?

Actually your comment doesn&apos;t pass muster since Obama also won the south and Hillary is pretty much following the Obama coalition. Look who is president today. Many don&apos;t remember that in 2008 that Hillary had more popular votes than Obama and the delegate math was close. I don&apos;t believe either of them had enough delegates to win. But the super delegates that had previously been pledged to her were awarded to Obama because he had more pledged delegates even as SHE had more popular votes. Elenor Clift wrote an article in The Daily Beast about the superdelegates if anyone wants to refresh their knowledge. If Bernie has more pledged delegates, he&apos;ll win the supers. If he doesn&apos;t he won&apos;t. And no amount of wishing will make that fact change. Here&apos;s the article: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/04/democratic-superdelegates-how-the-party-learned-to-start-worrying-and-fear-its-voters.html

And how presidential was Clinton&apos;s response to the woman from Greenpeace?

It would make perfect sense to apply the metaphor of "momentum" to politics if politicians were perfectly round billiard balls and voters were a completely flat and uniform plane. I&apos;ve never seen an election that works that way. Unlike actual momentum (in physics), political momentum jumps from 0 to 60 the second you win an election, and it stops on a dime when you lose the next election. Perhaps it&apos;s time to bury this zombie concept?

The momentum for Sanders at the moment is psychological. I just hope he keeps it clean. He&apos;s not the kid from Brooklyn any more. He&apos;s a candidate for United States President and a Senator from Vermont.

As the saying goes in baseball, "momentum" is only as good as tomorrow&apos;s starting pitcher, which in this case is the state of New York.  The cold fact is that BEFORE Wisconsin, Sanders needed 57% of the remaining pledged delegates to be on a path to the nomination.  And AFTER Wisconsin, he now needs to win 58%.  All that means is that time is running out, and there are fewer delegates up for grabs.  Numbers don&apos;t lie, and all the thumbs down reactions to this comment won&apos;t change them.

Point by point
1     Daily News interview: The New York Times and Huffington Post disagree with you. Both say that the Daily News editors failed to understand Sanders&apos; sensible answers. Read it here:
http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/upshot/yes-bernie-sanders-knows-something-about-breaking-up-banks.html?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com&_r=1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-daily-news_us_5704779ce4b0a506064d8df5
2     "Bern Bros" is a discredited meme that the Clinton campaign tried to use early on to falsely accuse Sanders&apos; supporters of sexism.
3     Saying that Sanders runs a " divisive smear campaign" does not  make it true. Can you give examples? Please don&apos;t cite the campaign pointing out factually correct information as smear. Clinton does receive a great deal of money from banks, drug companies, health industry, fossil fuel. That&apos;s an issue that voters care about.
4     Being female does not make one a progressive. Margaret  Thatcher? Sarah Palin?
5     Flipping super delegates is not overriding the will of the people. Super delegates override the people&apos;s will by refusing to vote with their district. Furthermore, the whole concept is elitist and undemocratic.
6     I don&apos;t think a major power broker like Hillary needs to play the "white male privilege" victim card. 
7     "Losing by millions of votes." It ain&apos;t over till it&apos;s over. Then we&apos;ll talk about who deserves the nomination. Until then both candidates will continue to claim she/he deserves it. That&apos;s how campaigns work.
8     Nothing arrogant about Tim Robbins&apos; comment about South Carolina. What is the last time a Democrat won South Carolina? Hint: Jimmy Carter. Next to last? Kennedy in 1960. Even Goldwater carried it in his 486-52 landslide loss in &apos;64. South Carolina is not relevant to a Democratic win.
9     I can make no sense out of your next sentence.
10    "Wrong side of the gun issue" First, it&apos;s more than one issue. There are quite a number of issues relative to guns. Is Bernie wrong on some of them? Perhaps. But I&apos;ll never have a candidate who is on the "right" side of every issue until I run myself ;-) Until then I&apos;ll take someone who is right almost always.
11    "Treating Hillary this way"  Believe me, Bernie supporters feel mistreated too. And Hillary supporters felt mistreated by Obama eight years ago. Remember PUMAs?
12    Hillary does have support among people of color. Working folks, not so much. Last night Sanders overwhelmingly won every income bracket under $200K.
13    Sanders overwhelmingly wins the young vote. Last night he won all brackets under 50. He captured 84% of the under 24 vote. This is typical. Millennials -- regardless of race, gender, or any other criteria --  are inheriting a country (and world) that is threatened by climate change brought on to a large extent by fossil fuels, by extreme income and wealth inequality, by crushing student debt, by a diminishing of middle class opportunity, by world-wide poverty and terrorism, and by a corrupt political system that stymies the implementation of even the most obvious and popular solutions. They are the future of the Democratic party and of the Progressive movement. Disagree with them, but don&apos;t just dismiss them. Listen.

I love Bernie. I love his message. But he doesn&apos;t deserve a single vote moving forward if he can&apos;t answer questions, like how he would break up the big banks (as revealed in the NY Daily News interview).  He has shown time and again that when pressed about how he&apos;ll enact any of his proposals,  he acts like he doesn&apos;t understand how government works. 
I find this a huge problem and one that should give people great pause. As for this being a realistic or truthful article, it&apos;s just not. It&apos;s Bernie fan fiction. Now THIS article, for anyone who actually wants some truth, will give you the lowdown on how even Bernie has not vetted his own campaign: http://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/4/6/what-if-he-wins-why-bernie-sanders-never-vetted-his-own-campaign-platform#.VwUp-Osxr6Y.twitter

In an interview with Amy Goodman, Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez who was actually there during the Sanders interview said, “I, overall, thought that Bernie Sanders handled the exchange very well.”  Breaking up banks, which are incorporated under state law, isn&apos;t a straightforward process.  Sanders pointed this out, noting the matter of jurisdiction.

Sanders has said he wants to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the law that was overturned by…You know, what&apos;s his name?  Oh, Bill Clinton.  This is what we are in store for with Hillary.  We progressives just don&apos;t trust her because she is and has been on the wrong side of history too many times.

I&apos;m a progressive. There are a lot of us out here who just understand that Bernie doesn&apos;t have answers that equal his promises/rhetoric.  For example, Bernie&apos;s plan for free tuition is bound to a state participation model with matching federal funds. Vox explains why his plan is unrealistic: 
http://www.vox.com/2016/3/30/11332612/bernie-sanders-free-college
And his promise regarding mass incarceration? This is what he said verbatim: 
"So here&apos;s a promise that I make to you: Number one, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country."
Mother Jones had an article on why his plan isn&apos;t feasible. And Vox gets into the weeds:
http://www.vox.com/2016/2/8/10937468/bernie-sanders-mass-incarceration
As for health care, there actually IS a provision for a public option in the ACA. Even that couldn&apos;t get passed. And we have Republican governors who wouldn&apos;t take the Medicaid expansion. Again, *states* and a problem involving jurisdiction that Bernie would have no control over.
What Bernie doesn&apos;t seem to get is that we are a federation of states. It&apos;s pretty basic stuff. We&apos;re not set up like Denmark. I do think a lot of these things could come with time. But there won&apos;t be sweeping change (which usually produces a backlash anyway). Incremental changes are the changes that last. SS and Medicare started as small programs and expanded to what we have today. Similarly, we can improve the ACA to become much better and insure more people.
And as others here have said, Bernie hates the Democratic party so much so they he&apos;s willing to cut off his nose to spite their face. Yet he won&apos;t be able to get things accomplished if down ticket Dems (who he doesn&apos;t wish to fund raise for) don&apos;t win their races. So at this point, he&apos;s just not leveling with people. And his bid for superdelgates is facile at best. See my other comment with the link to an article by Elenor Clift of The Daily Beast. 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/04/democratic-superdelegates-how-the-party-learned-to-start-worrying-and-fear-its-voters.html

Your comment is fair.  But, I think the point is that the banks have to be reduced in size and scope somehow.  Is that something you agree on?  I too want to hear specifics, but I think everyone knows it will be a struggle.  Isn&apos;t it worth the struggle?  Can&apos;t "we" figure out a way to keep these HUGE banks from taking our tax dollars again?  They will take our money again unless we the people stop it.

My guess is that he would rely heavily on Sen. Warren for the details of how to break up the big banks. We know how HRC would do it... she wouldn&apos;t! HRC doesn&apos;t deserve a single further vote until she makes public the transcripts of her paid speeches to these same big banks.

This is great, but I&apos;d like to see some analysis of who would do best in the states in which the democrats are likely to compete. I think Hillary&apos;s big win in, say, South Carolina is probably meaningless. In fact, her "big" lead over Bernie is probably due to her popularity in red states? So, maybe we should consider "math", "momentum" and "meaningfulness" in assessing his campaign. I am not suggesting we move away from a 50 state strategy but, rather, we need to redesign our primary process to help determine our "best" candidate.

Because Ohio and Florida are never important in the general? Hillary won them by a combined 30 points. Enough delusions from the Bernie camp.

The delusion for many democrats is that they will get something different from Clinton this time. Something other than Wall Street economics  and trade agreements and military industrial hawkish foreign policy. She will be cool on some social issues, maybe a little behind like with DOMA, as our corporate bought government leads us onward toward full blown oligarchy.

... Here it comes. Always the caveat. The bad news tsunami started last night with the fabulous NYT spraying the news equivalent of cat pee with its Sandy Hook expose&apos; all over Bernie&apos;s parade. This one is going to be slow and dirty. I hope native New Yawkahs understand that Bernie is not a one-trick pony. Reasonable people can differ on civil liability for gun shops and still present viable arguments for salvaging what is left of our democracy. To me, that is the sine qua non of this election.
I will still vote for HRC should she pull it out, but I will leave no doubt where my druthers are.
Grace and peace,
aures lupi

The argument about gun manufacture’s liability is nonsense.
What if a psychopath purposefully drives a Chevrolet through a crowd of political protestors in a downtown intersection? Can the victims sue Chevrolet? Of Course NOT! How is it any different when a psychopath uses a legal item, such as a semi-automatic rifle, to commit a heinous act? Essentially, it’s not any different. Chevrolet stands in no danger of being sued for the murderous use of its product, and gun makers must be afforded similar protection. I’m in favor of additional laws to make our Nation much more safe from gun-nuts, but HRC’s statement that gun manufactures should be sued is not tenable.

REMINDER: The Wisconsin primary was an OPEN primary where 25% of voters were Independents & 2.5% Republican. The New York Primary is CLOSED to all but Democrats, as is the case in  PA, NJ, DE, MD, NM, CT.

The delgate math heavily favors Clinton in upcoming contests and it&apos;s the only math that will ultimately count. John, there is no such thing as momentum math. Sure, superdelegates can change their minds, but with HRC likely to win a much larger plurality of delegates and votes, this isn&apos;t going to happen. It would subvert the will of the people.

I&apos;m a big fan of Mr. Nichols and miss his appearances on the Ed Show.  I count myself as one of the initial Sanders supporters and it is refreshing to receive positive and accurate reporting.  I have always questioned Mrs. Clinton&apos;s judgement on issues like El Salvador, Libya, Iraq, and especially compromising national security with her private E-mail server.  We deserve a man with integrity and judgement like Mr. Sanders.

This is the kind of honesty that has left me trusting the Nation more than any other publication in this country.

It is so refreshing to read an account that does not disparage Mr. Sanders&apos; remarkable accomplishments to date and yet provides the necessary caveat about future challenges. Thank you, Mr. Nichols.

Love it!  Especially the shot out tot he WFP!! Great people!

Good analysis, thanks.  And thanks for not telling Bernie to "be an adult" and get out.
