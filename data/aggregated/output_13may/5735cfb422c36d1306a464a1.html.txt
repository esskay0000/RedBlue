Cory Booker went to the Congressional Black Caucus lunch with a mission Wednesday.

The New Jersey senator, who was tasked with bringing lunch, delivered a "vegan banquet" with sushi, salad and other entrees—possibly a first for his colleagues, by the looks of it.

Many lawmakers were grateful for the meal (or so they said once Booker came up to them with his phone recording video). A few couldn't help but throw shade at the vegan-lover.

"Whenever I'm hungry, I eat anything, senator," said Rep. William "Lacy" Clay of Missouri.

"I think we should never allow you to buy lunch again," Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio.

Booker wasn't trying to make his colleagues suffer. The avid vegan was trying to promote healthy eating, especially in light of the health disparities blacks face. They are more likely to suffer from diabetes, heart disease and cancer than whites. For Booker it's about taking steps to "be, live, and embody the change we want to see in the world."

Still, he might have some convincing to do.

"What are you missing?" Booker asked Fudge.

Her response? "Meat."
