Donald Trump is out with a new video on Instagram knocking Hillary Clinton over her handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks.

Hillary has bad judgment!

A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 10, 2016 at 10:25am PDT

The ad features news clips of the families of victims killed in the Benghazi attack.

It begins with a clip of Clinton saying the attack on the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, was caused by a video, then shows footage of three family members of men killed in the attacks.

“She lied to me, she told me it was the fault of the video,” Patricia Smith, mother of Sean Smith, said.

“She said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who is responsible for the death of your son,” said Charles Wood, father of Tyrone Woods.

“Absolutely” she said the attack was caused by protests, Glen Doherty’s sister, Kate Quigley, said.

It ends with a clip of Clinton laughing juxtaposed against footage of flames.
