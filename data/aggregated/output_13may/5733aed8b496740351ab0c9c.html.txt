MAY 11--Incensed that her husband got her “the wrong flowers and candy” for Mother’s Day, a Florida woman allegedly pummeled her spouse, according to cops who arrested her for domestic battery.

Investigators allege that Virginia Stewart, 42, attacked her spouse during an argument early Sunday in their family’s Holmes Beach residence. Cops arrived at the house in response to a 911 hangup call.

As detailed in a probable cause affidavit, Stewart quarreled with her husband about “the victim getting her the wrong flowers and candy for Mother’s Day.”

After Stewart “did throw cups around the room and break them,” she allegedly attacked her spouse, punching him several times while also striking the man in the head with a coat hanger.

Stewart’s husband suffered “bruising and contusions,” noted cops, who added that the “injuries were highly visible on the left side of his face with contusions all over.”

Seen above, Stewart was arrested for domestic battery and booked into the county jail. She was released from custody Monday after posting $750 bond.

Stewart is scheduled for a June 9 arraignment on the misdemeanor charge. A judicial order bars Stewart from having any contact with her husband “until further court order.” (2 pages)
