New York is an electoral microclimate that is in many senses distinct from the rest of the United States, yet the storms that develop in New York sweep across the American political landscape. We know; The Nation was founded in New York, and we have been covering this city and its outsized influence on this country for 150 years. Because so much economic, social, and media power is concentrated in New York, it shapes not just a local debate but a coast-to-coast dialogue. Perhaps it is true that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But what happens in New York goes national.

So as the 2016 Democratic presidential race crashes into New York City in advance of the April 19 New York state primary, it is no surprise that everything is blowing up. The charges and countercharges are flying, the tabloid headlines are rolling off the presses, and the pundits say that “Wisconsin nice” has been replaced by “New York nasty.” We don’t quite buy that. What’s happening is that a race that has been reasonably genteel—especially when compared to the brutal battle Republicans are experiencing in this Trumped-up campaign season—has intensified because so much is at stake. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton retains her front-runner status, with a clear lead in the race for delegates. But Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is winning the momentum race, having secured overwhelming majorities on six of the last seven contests—including a Wisconsin primary fight where both candidates ran hard and Sanders carried 71 of 72 counties and won 57 percent of the statewide vote.		
The morning after the Wisconsin primary, all attention shifted to New York and it seemed as if the volume was suddenly turned up to 11. Unfortunately, the New York fight started with less focus on issues and ideas and more focus on foibles and mischaracterizations. Let us break through the New York noise and state a few things up front: Bernie Sanders has a lot of good ideas for breaking up big banks, he cares a lot about victims of gun violence, and he knows that subway tokens are a thing of the past. Hillary Clinton knows how to use a MetroCard, she understands that mass incarceration must be addressed, and she is qualified to serve as president of the United States.

It is on that last question of qualifications that the Democratic contest has turned particularly edgy. On April 6, Clinton was asked on the MSNBC show Morning Joe if she believed Sanders is “qualified and ready” to be president. Clinton said responses by Sanders to questions from the New York Daily News editorial board “raised a lot of really serious questions.” The headline writers at The Washington Post wrote: “Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president.” Sanders responded by noting the questioning of his qualifications and said of Clinton: “I don’t believe that she is qualified if she is, through her Super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds. I don’t think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your Super PAC. I don’t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq. I don’t think you are qualified if you’ve supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement, which has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.”

Now everyone has gone to their corners, as accusations and demands for apologies fly back and forth, and pundits talk up the notion that, by the times the New York primary rolls around, the Democratic race really could be as nasty as the Republican race. That won’t happen, in part because Clinton and Sanders have more respect for one another than the Republican candidates do, in part because an argument about qualifications and records is dramatically different from an argument about wives and hand sizes.		
Nation editors examined the qualifications of both Clinton and Sanders before making an endorsement in the race. We concluded that, on the most basic measures, both candidates are exceptionally well qualified: Clinton is a former senator and secretary of state with vast experience working on an array of critical issues: from children’s rights to women’s rights to healthcare reform, and the direction of American foreign policy. Sanders is a former mayor, congressman, and US senator who helped to form the Congressional Progressive Caucus, became a master of the legislative process (using amendments to shape policy even in Republican-controlled congresses), and forged a remarkable bipartisan coalition to develop and pass the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation to be enacted in decades.		
We could accept either of these candidates as president, but we endorsed Sanders with enthusiasm because we believe that he has additional qualifications rooted in judgement and vision. He did vote against authorizing the war in Iraq, and against the Patriot Act, and against trade deals that have done enormous damage to the prospects of American workers and American communities. He has steadily opposed the death penalty and argued for criminal-justice reform, and he recognizes and challenges the economic underpinnings of structural racism. He objects to regime change as a foreign-policy priority and instead argues for a focus on diplomacy and development. And he has recognized, along with Elizabeth Warren, that our rigged economy extends from a rigged political process in which special-interest groups and billionaires have far more influence that citizens. On many of these issues, Clinton has developed credible positions, but she keeps arguing for lowered expectations and more limited goals. That’s not what is needed. When Sanders speaks of the need for a political revolution, he evidences an understanding of just how serious the moment is and just how bold we must be in fighting for the future. To our view, that recognition is a qualification. Indeed, it is the qualification that makes us confident that Bernie Sanders is the candidate who is best prepared to be the Democratic nominee and the president of the United States.

I would like to offer this statement, "We favor the enactment of a national health program far expanded medical research, medical education, and hospitals and clinics." It might sound current or familiar, but it is a direct quote from the Democratic Party Platform of 1948. This was the year I was born so I can safely say that Universal Healthcare has been part of the national debate for my entire life and we still do not have it. The Editors have correctly hit upon the key point which defines Sanders, that is he understands the need for a political revolution, because that is how things will change. After all, we are a nation that invented rock and roll at the same time that we were developing rockets to land people on the moon. When did we become so accepting of politicians who preach it&apos;s not practical, not politically feasible, and we&apos;re not Denmark. Change does not come from a detailed plan inside Bernie&apos;s coat pocket that Paul Krugman would like to see, it comes from a strong will, confidence, determination, and bringing thousands of qualified people into government who can solve problems, develop  solutions and make it happen. Bernie Sanders is indeed "fighting for the future" and he should be supported.

No surprise that the Nation felt the need to re-affirm their commitment to Bernie given the exist rhetoric coming out of that campaign right now. If Cruz or Trump attacked Hillary for being ambitious or unqualified or if they espoused the radical pro-gun views that Bernie does, so-called progressives would be all over them. Bernie is not liberal, not progressive. Calling a woman leading the primary by millions of votes ambitious is just plain sexist, not progressive. Also, dismissing the black Southern voters as meaningless is just plain racist. And that is exactly what Bernie does when he dismisses HRC  supports s the confederacy or whatever other dog whistle racism he wants to engage in. But doesn&apos;t matter, Bernie is floundering badly in NY so this sexist, racist nightmare will soon be over and the true progressive will be nominaged.

So intentionally mendacious, you&apos;re remarks are beneath comment.

Do you actually really truly believe that Sanders&apos;  is a raging sexist, racist, nightmare?  

That doesn&apos;t make any sense given the policies and political vision he is currently championing, and that, he has championed for decades.  

If he is a raging sexist, why did Gloria Steinem come to Vermont to campaign for him in 1996 and bequeath upon him the title of "honorary woman?"  If he is a raging sexist, why is he now championing pay equity, paid family leave, and economic polices such as $15/ hr  minimum wage and universal health care which will help women immensely.   Why is he unequivocally pro-choice? 

Why if he is a raging racist, does he talk about institutional racism at every campaign stop, about the horrors of police brutality, and the racially motivated injustices of the criminal justice system and the crime of mass incarceration in this country which targets blacks and Latinos disproportionately ?  Why has he called for the restoration of the voting rights act, and why does he rail at every campaign stop about racist voter ID laws?  Why has he called for an end to the war on drugs in explicitly racial terms--citing over and over that though whites and blacks smoke pot at the same rates, blacks are far more likely to be incarcerated for doing so?  

While he remains a huge long shot to win the nomination, he is not floundering in NY.  Coming from over forty points down against a home state candidate he is making this race very very close.   It almost certainly won&apos;t be enough to push him over the top, but it can hardly be characterized as floundering. 

Bernie Sanders is engaged in a political campaign.  So is Hillary Clinton.  They are, not surprisingly, each trying to bolster their own candidacy, while sewing seeds of doubt about their opponent.   

All things considered, even at the current relative fever pitch, the campaign has not gotten particularly  nasty by historical standards.  Just go back to the last heated primary between Obama and Clinton.  Things were MUCH nastier then.   

Each candidate is making their case--one calling for a radical shift from the current hard right political reality of our country, and the other calling for minor change within the current structure. 
Robert Reich summed this up nicely when he said:
“I’ve known Hillary Clinton since she was 19 years old, and have nothing but respect for her. In my view, she’s the most qualified candidate for president of the political system we now have. But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have, because he’s leading a political movement for change.”

I think it&apos;s totally fair to disagree on which track is appropriate.  That&apos;s what the election is about.  Baseless claims that Bernie is a raging sexist racist have no place in an honest discussion of these competing visions.

True Progressive... Objectively speaking, Hillary is one of the least progressive members of the Democratic party.  Both parties are "big tent" parties and had various levels of progressivism and conservatism.  Hillary happens to be on the less progressive side of the party.  Nothing wrong with that (other than it being ideologically wrong). Just so happens that the party base is MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE than the party itself and now is showing.  50% of democrats are so progressive they are voting for the guy who is so progressive that he didn&apos;t even feel comfortable being a Democrat until now.  And his lack of connection to the party establishment is not a weakness to be attacked... IT IS THE REASON WE SUPPORT HIM! Keep mentioning that he has not been a life long democrat.  That is the BEST THING ABOUT HIM!!!!

Hillary is not qualified to represent a "progressive" democratic party (she would be qualified to run as a republican)  because of the following reasons:

 (1) Terrifying drones perpetuating war and the cycle of violence in other peoples&apos; lands; 
(2)  Promoting the Ukrainian coup, which installed a $Billionaire president for the country; 
(3) Supporting [perhaps initiating] the Honduran coup of 2009 (never called it a coup) apparently to push mining interests and a dam  project, that nobody wants except capital markets.  The U.S. State Dept. passively approves the gruesome  coup-installed dictatorship.  U.S.  funds the military “government” so  American corporations can  make more fast money.
(4) Blundering with an attempted "democratic" revolution in  Libya,  naively proliferating heavy arms and ammo all over North Africa, which the CIA can no longer track.
 (5) Sent  $11 Billion (in the face of the Leahy resolution) worth of war planes and bombs to Saudis, which the Saudis are using  to bomb  [Shiite] civilian targets, hospitals,  killing thousands of children, women  and men  in Yemen,  raising tensions with Iran, who give humanitarian support to the Yemini bomb victims. 
(6) Passively supporting, and providing arms to Israel for killing unarmed civilians in West Bank and Israel,  and Gaza, which has no air defense, except un-guided bottle rockets and tunnels. 
(7) Supporting an ongoing trade embargo of Gaza, which include food and basic essentials, makings it a virtual open-air prison...
One would think republican right wingers have been in the oval office and in the State department for the last 7 years.

I was very happy to read The Nation&apos;s re-endorsement of Mr. Sanders; given the increasing amount of heavy artillery aimed in his direction lately by the the all-too-self-impressed powers that be, the reprise is very, very welcome. But I am puzzled by the praise of Mrs. Clinton&apos;s experience and abilities. I know acknowledgement of same seems to be in the air, but I remain puzzled. She may be "qualified", but given the depressed standards now current, that ain&apos;t sayin&apos; much. First, it has to be admitted that Mrs. Clinton didn&apos;t have to do much to become senator; it&apos;s not as if she had to work her way up the ranks.  Once there, as far as I can tell, her most important achievement was to vote the wrong way on the invasion of Iraq - no doubt advised by her dear friend, Dr. Kissinger. She then ran for the Democratic nomination and lost. The next thing we hear is that she becomes Secretary of State . . . but . . . why? Was it because of the aforementioned vote? No? The ducking while under enemy fire at peaceful airports? Maybe. Her general belligerence under fire - although likable enough? Hmmm. Well, anyway, how did she conduct herself in that high office? First, she failed to safeguard the affairs of state by her adamant refusal to ensure  communications security. Second, she continued to project American arrogance abroad with her belligerence, a belligerence now backed up by the Department of State.  Third, State Department approval for weapons purchases became contingent on contribution to The Clinton Family Foundation, the  most audacious influence peddling scheme in American history. Fourth, when she had been informed of Quaddafi&apos;s death, she quipped "We came, we saw, he died", followed by a self-congratulatory laugh. That quip, that laugh, went round the world; it assured all of our enemies - and all of our friends, too - that American arrogance was back, and not just back, but with a public triumphalism truly nauseating to see.  Those are just a few of the reasons why I find Mrs. Clinton unqualified - and ethically unfit - to become President.

Yes.  Thank you, The Nation, for pointing out the real differences between the would-be Democratic candidates.  Clinton has occupied high offices on the whole to the detriment of American citizens, and American interests abroad, but always to her personal advantage.  Bernie Sanders has occupied high offices without ever taking his focus from the ethical reasons which appear to have brought him into politics, and, it would seem there is no time in American history when such an approach may be necessary to even begin rebuilding a functioning democracy, and attempt to salvage a habitable planet.  Thank you for re-endorsing him.  Still, I remain deeply disappointed with HRCs resume: a seeming Zelig for being photographed at historical moments, and always behaving in the most reactionary and thuggish way possible.  I don&apos;t see it as "experience," but perhaps an out-of-body nightmare for the electorate.  I&apos;ve been kind of floating above my bed the last few years looking down on myself as I contemplate the aggressions of my government.  It&apos;s difficult for me to for me to reconstruct the face of my attacker, but she looked a lot like Hillary...

Thank you! Happy Friday!
