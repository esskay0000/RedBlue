Since his time as House speaker ended last fall, John Boehner's been getting used to retirement.

He's got plenty of time. A lot of money. He could do anything he wants, but one of Boehner's favorite pastimes as a retiree has been straight-up clowning on Ted Cruz.

Since leaving office, Boehner's publicly called Cruz " a miserable son of a bitch," and then "Lucifer" before that.

And on Thursday, while speaking at a conference in Las Vegas, Boehner expressed glee at Cruz's failed presidential bid.

"Thank God that guy from Texas didn’t win," Boehner said, per the Wall Street Journal.

Boehner then reportedly riffed on the blowback he got from calling Cruz Lucifer:

Listen: Boehner could be on some far-flung beach right now, getting even more tan, sipping drinks out of coconuts with those little umbrellas in them. He could be on a Carnival Cruise Line ship hustling fellow retirees in shuffleboard. He could do anything.

But no. John Boehner wakes up every morning, it seems, with a singular thought, a unified focus: "How will I trash Ted Cruz on this day?"

Is it sporting? Probably not. Does it enliven all of our Twitter timelines? Yes, yes it does.

To be fair, this isn't just a post-retirement fixation for John Boehner. He also reportedly called Cruz "a jackass" while still House speaker.

The animosity of course stems from Boehner's frustration with Cruz over Texas senator's famous lack of compromise, which stymied many a deal among Republican leaders in Congress.

We know how this began. We know not how it will end. Buckle up and grab some popcorn.
