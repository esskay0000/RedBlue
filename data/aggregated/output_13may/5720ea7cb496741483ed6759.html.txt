Song written by inmates to be performed at White House














         COLUMBIA, S.C.        (AP) -- A group of musicians affiliated with Carnegie Hall are taking music created by inmates at one of South Carolina&apos;s most dangerous prisons to the White House.

Members of a group called Decoda are performing "Welcome to my World" on Wednesday for an audience expected to include U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

The song was written earlier this year by inmates at Lee Correctional Institution, a maximum-security prison in Bishopville. Members of Decoda worked for a week with a select group of inmates, guiding them through the song-writing process and helping them put together a concert of their own.

The performance Wednesday is part of National Reentry Week, aimed at helping the roughly 600,000 state and federal prisoners who return each year to neighborhoods to better acclimate to society.
