Will Bunch is senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily News and author of "Tear Down This Myth: The Right-Wing Distortion of the Reagan Legacy" and the recent e-book, "The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

 (CNN)After losing an embarrassing six straight primaries, including the critical states of Florida and Illinois, the upstart presidential candidate came under tremendous pressure from the party establishment to get out of the race.  Party insiders called his proposals "simplistic," pundits fretted he was too old and even a key aide admitted one goal was to show "we were not the candidate of kooks."

George Will wrote in 1974 that Reagan looked "too old" to be taken seriously, that he had "never demonstrated national appeal" and that his hardcore supporters were "kamikaze" ideologues.
