After his five Republican primary wins Tuesday night, Donald Trump has received more popular votes this primary season than Mitt Romney did in all of 2012. And if he keeps pace, Trump could receive more GOP votes than any presidential candidate in decades.

As reported by Politico, Trump's wins across the Northeast this week put him past 10 million votes. That equals roughly 250,000 more than Romney collected as the eventual nominee four years ago and 153,000 more than Republican nominee John McCain garnered in 2008.

Trump needs only 800,000 more votes to surpass George W. Bush, who earned a record 10.8 million popular votes on his way to the White House in 2000.

For context, Politico spoke with University of Minnesota political science professor Eric Ostermeier, who noted that just eight candidates have topped more than 7.5 million Republican votes since the party instituted its primary system in 1976.
