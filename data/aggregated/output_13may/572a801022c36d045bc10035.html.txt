NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — The National Football League is warning its players from eating too much meat in China and Mexico because it could cause a failed drug test.

The NFL said in a memo that some meat produced in China and Mexico could be contaminated with anabolic agent clenbuterol, which is banned by the league’s Performance-Enhancing Substances policy.

“Consuming large quantities of meat while visiting those particular countries may result in a positive test for clenbuterol in violation of the Policy,” the league said.

The memo continued, “Players are warned to be aware of this issue when traveling to Mexico and China. Please take caution if you decide to consume meat, and understand that you do so at your own risk.”

Arizona Cardinals defensive back Patrick Peterson posted the memo on his Twitter account, joking he’s going to have to go vegan while on vacation.

“This can’t be real life!” Peterson tweeted, with the hashtags “SMH (shaking my head)” and “Gotta Go Vegan On Vacation.”

It appears the NFL won’t take pity on players if they fail a test for eating too much meat in these countries.

“Please remember that as stated in the NFL Policy for Performance-Enhancing Substances: ‘Players are responsible for what is in their bodies,’” the memo said.
