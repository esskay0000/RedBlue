Cher has been a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton during this presidential election year, but now she may be changing her mind.

The singer took to Twitter on Wednesday to talk about the internal conflict she feels over which Democratic candidate to support for the presidency. In the past, Cher has criticized Bernie Sanders and his campaign staff. In January, she called Sanders "so disingenuous" for running as a Democrat, saying he's an "independent socialist" who "can't win" and comparing him to Ralph Nader.

On Tuesday night, Cher continued her criticism of the Sanders campaign, calling Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver "scum" and an "asshole." She tweeted, "His 'Hillary is responsible for ISIS' is pure Trump."

However, on Wednesday, Cher said that after blocking people on Twitter she started to "feel uneasy" and went into "marathon research mode" with an open mind. She said that "in the quiet of the night," she discovered that Sanders' beliefs "mirrored" her own more than she had realized. The singer said she was "shaken to [her] core" by this revelation.

Cher went on to talk about how much she liked and respected Clinton, whom she spent time with when Clinton was running for the Senate. Cher said that she hopes the woman she fought hard for is still there, but that now she's faced with a difficult decision.

"Realize now that I have MUCH common ground and new respect for [Bernie Sanders]," said Cher, adding that she's torn up. She has not, however, changed her opinion of Sanders' campaign manager Weaver.

Democratic-leaning Hollywood celebrities have divided allegiances between Sanders and Clinton. Lena Dunham, America Ferrera, Olivia Wilde, Demi Lovato and Will Ferrell have all expressed their support for Clinton, while Sanders has Rosario Dawson, Sarah Silverman, Susan Sarandon, Spike Lee and Mark Ruffalo in his corner.
