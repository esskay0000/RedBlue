As he continues to campaign for Democratic primary votes from Indiana to Oregon, Bernie Sanders has begun to detail a vision for where the movement that has developed to support his candidacy might move the Democratic Party.

After winning only the Rhode Island primary on a Tuesday that saw front-runner Hillary Clinton win Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Connecticut—and, with those wins, a substantial boost in her delegate-race advantage—the Vermont senator released a primary-night statement that anticipated a way forward even if he does not win the party’s nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.				
					
					
Sanders made it clear that his campaign—which has won 18 contests and 1,355 delegates and has the potential to win more primaries and delegates—would go on. “The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be. That’s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast,” said the senator. Then he offered a framework for how that campaign might influence the direction not just of the party but of politics in the years to come. “[This] campaign,” said Sanders, “is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.”				
					
					
Sanders has expanded on these themes on the campaign trail in recent days, in appearances in the key primary states of Indiana (which votes on May 3) and Oregon (which votes on May 17). On Wednesday, Sanders drew a cheering crowd of 2,200 people to a town-hall meeting on the campus of Purdue University, where he added new material to the stump speech he has delivered from the start of a presidential run that has challenged Clinton and the Democratic Party to move left on a host of issues.

“Let me make this clear, so there is no confusion: We are in this campaign to win, and become the Democratic nominee,” Sanders told the students in Indiana. “We are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we are going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.”				
					
					
On Thursday in Eugene, Oregon, and again on Friday at the Indiana statehouse, where he rallied with steelworkers whose plants are threatened with closure as part of a corporate relocation to Mexico, Sanders made trade policy central to his demand for a new politics that champions working families over CEOs.				
			

							Bernie Sanders says he and his delegates will “fight for a progressive party platform.”
						
 
“The Democratic Party, up to now, has not been clear about which side they are on, on the major issues facing this country. You cannot be on the side of those workers who have lost their jobs, because of disastrous trade agreements, and support those corporations who have thrown millions of our workers out on the street,” Sanders told the crowd of 8,000 in Oregon.				
					
					
“The Democratic Party has to reach a fundamental conclusion: Are we on the side of working people or big money interests?” the senator thundered. “Do we stand with the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor or Wall Street speculators and the drug companies and the insurance companies?”				
					
					
Political and media elites, whose default position is to focus on the horse race (and the personalities associated with it), are quick to dismiss fights over agendas and platforms. With no sense of history, they imagine politics as little more than a progression from one dominant figure to the next. Movements, and the political trends and progressions that extend from movement-oriented campaigns, are invariably dismissed.				
					
					
But it was a movement, and a movement politics, that forced the Democratic Party to embrace a more muscular civil-rights platform than Harry Truman wanted in 1948; it was a movement, and movement politics, that began to open up the Democratic Party in ways that Lyndon Johnson had resisted in 1964. And it was the dismissal of movements, and movement politics, that proved to be disastrous for the Democratic Party in 1968.

This is not 1968. The issues are different and the political processes are different. Conventions are more managed. And parties have come to see their quadrennial gatherings less as opportunities to frame their own future and that of the country and more as marketing moments.				
			

							“Issues are negotiable. We could not afford to avoid raising the right questions.”
— the Rev. Jesse Jackson
						
 
But 2016 is the most volatile political year since 1968. And the responses of the parties to it will define not just political organizations but the politics of this year and the years to come.				
					
					
So what Bernie Sanders is talking about matters. It does not mean that he will get what he wants at the convention. It does not mean that Hillary Clinton, who has her own vision and her own strategies, should accept every proposal that Sanders or broader movements make. There are no guarantees that the Democratic Party can or will run in 2016 on “the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.”				
					
					
But no one should buy into the fantasy that this discussion is inconsequential. Platform debates always matter. That’s why the candidates (front-runners and challengers) always take them seriously; that’s why key players in political parties (governor, mayors, legislators, union leaders) participate in them; that’s why interest groups try so hard to influence them.

Platforms define parties, not just for the purposes of a campaign but for the future. It mattered when the Democratic Party embraced civil rights in a meaningful way in 1948, and in a more meaningful way in 1960 and 1964. It mattered in the 1980s when the Democratic Party moved (at the behest of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his “Rainbow Coalition” campaigns) toward more aggressive opposition to South African apartheid, and when it moved (at the behest of the Jackson and Gary Hart campaigns of 1984) toward an embrace of the principle that the United States should work with allies rather than engage in unilateral military action. It mattered when the Democratic Party began to embrace LGBTQ rights in a meaningful way in its 1980 platform, and when it embraced marriage equality in 2012.				
					
					
And it matters, now, that Sanders is talking about “put[ting] together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.”				
					
					
For Sanders and his allies, along with progressives who have backed Clinton, the effort itself is consequential—not just in terms of framing the party’s immediate agenda but also in terms of framing the future of our politics.				
					
					
“We could afford to lose the vote,” explained the Rev. Jesse Jackson, after waging critical platform fights in 1984. “Issues are negotiable. We could not afford to avoid raising the right questions. Our self-respect and our moral integrity were at stake. Our heads are perhaps bloody, but unbowed. Our back is straight and our vision is clear.”				
					
					
What was true three decades ago remains true now: Platform fights on issues of conscience and consequence, inspired by insurgent campaigns and insurgent movements, are always worth waging.

— the Rev. Jesse Jackson
						
 
But 2016 is the most volatile political year since 1968. And the responses of the parties to it will define not just political organizations but the politics of this year and the years to come.				
					
					
So what Bernie Sanders is talking about matters. It does not mean that he will get what he wants at the convention. It does not mean that Hillary Clinton, who has her own vision and her own strategies, should accept every proposal that Sanders or broader movements make. There are no guarantees that the Democratic Party can or will run in 2016 on “the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.”				
					
					
But no one should buy into the fantasy that this discussion is inconsequential. Platform debates always matter. That’s why the candidates (front-runners and challengers) always take them seriously; that’s why key players in political parties (governor, mayors, legislators, union leaders) participate in them; that’s why interest groups try so hard to influence them.

Platforms define parties, not just for the purposes of a campaign but for the future. It mattered when the Democratic Party embraced civil rights in a meaningful way in 1948, and in a more meaningful way in 1960 and 1964. It mattered in the 1980s when the Democratic Party moved (at the behest of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his “Rainbow Coalition” campaigns) toward more aggressive opposition to South African apartheid, and when it moved (at the behest of the Jackson and Gary Hart campaigns of 1984) toward an embrace of the principle that the United States should work with allies rather than engage in unilateral military action. It mattered when the Democratic Party began to embrace LGBTQ rights in a meaningful way in its 1980 platform, and when it embraced marriage equality in 2012.				
					
					
And it matters, now, that Sanders is talking about “put[ting] together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.”				
					
					
For Sanders and his allies, along with progressives who have backed Clinton, the effort itself is consequential—not just in terms of framing the party’s immediate agenda but also in terms of framing the future of our politics.				
					
					
“We could afford to lose the vote,” explained the Rev. Jesse Jackson, after waging critical platform fights in 1984. “Issues are negotiable. We could not afford to avoid raising the right questions. Our self-respect and our moral integrity were at stake. Our heads are perhaps bloody, but unbowed. Our back is straight and our vision is clear.”				
					
					
What was true three decades ago remains true now: Platform fights on issues of conscience and consequence, inspired by insurgent campaigns and insurgent movements, are always worth waging.				
					
					
		

On Thursday in Eugene, Oregon, and again on Friday at the Indiana statehouse, where he rallied with steelworkers whose plants are threatened with closure as part of a corporate relocation to Mexico, Sanders made trade policy central to his demand for a new politics that champions working families over CEOs.				
			

							Bernie Sanders says he and his delegates will “fight for a progressive party platform.”
						
 
“The Democratic Party, up to now, has not been clear about which side they are on, on the major issues facing this country. You cannot be on the side of those workers who have lost their jobs, because of disastrous trade agreements, and support those corporations who have thrown millions of our workers out on the street,” Sanders told the crowd of 8,000 in Oregon.				
					
					
“The Democratic Party has to reach a fundamental conclusion: Are we on the side of working people or big money interests?” the senator thundered. “Do we stand with the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor or Wall Street speculators and the drug companies and the insurance companies?”				
					
					
Political and media elites, whose default position is to focus on the horse race (and the personalities associated with it), are quick to dismiss fights over agendas and platforms. With no sense of history, they imagine politics as little more than a progression from one dominant figure to the next. Movements, and the political trends and progressions that extend from movement-oriented campaigns, are invariably dismissed.				
					
					
But it was a movement, and a movement politics, that forced the Democratic Party to embrace a more muscular civil-rights platform than Harry Truman wanted in 1948; it was a movement, and movement politics, that began to open up the Democratic Party in ways that Lyndon Johnson had resisted in 1964. And it was the dismissal of movements, and movement politics, that proved to be disastrous for the Democratic Party in 1968.

There are no guarantees that the Democratic Party can or will run in 2016 on “the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.”				
					
					
But no one should buy into the fantasy that this discussion is inconsequential. Platform debates always matter. That’s why the candidates (front-runners and challengers) always take them seriously; that’s why key players in political parties (governor, mayors, legislators, union leaders) participate in them; that’s why interest groups try so hard to influence them.

Platforms define parties, not just for the purposes of a campaign but for the future. It mattered when the Democratic Party embraced civil rights in a meaningful way in 1948, and in a more meaningful way in 1960 and 1964. It mattered in the 1980s when the Democratic Party moved (at the behest of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his “Rainbow Coalition” campaigns) toward more aggressive opposition to South African apartheid, and when it moved (at the behest of the Jackson and Gary Hart campaigns of 1984) toward an embrace of the principle that the United States should work with allies rather than engage in unilateral military action.

Usually, the fight is one by the angriest contestant or participant. Trump has evidently one the Republican nomination by giving voice to that anger (just an observation). You can bet that these people will vote. Sanders has excited many who are first-time participants and others who had given up. This is the most emotionally charged political contest I have witnessed since 1968 (I was in Grant Park). I just cannot see Clinton arousing any excitement. There are a lot of pissed-off people in this country who are hurting and fed-up with the warm, yellow "trickle down" of incremental change.

Fights on any platform are ways we try to fill the void that are destroying us all. http://thelastwhy.ca/poems/2015/6/25/life-a-reaction-to-the-void

Nothing succeeds like success - or failure.  The Party elite will never let Sanders win in any way.  The platform changes proposed by Sanders will be  virtually ignored.  Sanders and his supporters will walk out of the convention.  The rise of the recent 
Democratic Party elitism - starting in the 1990&apos;s - will not fall to the trash bin of history, unless there is a Republican party presidential victory in November .  That is the elephant in the living room every progressive pretends is not there.  Think 2020.

One cannot always reach the final outcome in one go or even in one generation. Bernie was for gay marriage in the 80&apos;s but it didn&apos;t materialize till 2012 - 32 years later. 

What is important is to make that beginning which Bernie made: to show that these issues which everybody really wants, are not impossible to pay for, are not utopias, but are very well realizable. It is that realization that the desirable is possible, which will keep Bernie&apos;s issues alive - until some day the will be instituted. 

Bernie&apos;s greatness will one day be recognized. History will be his judge and his friend.

My criticism of the current system and primary outcome, should not be interpreted as criticism of Bernie Sanders, a person for whom I have the most profound respect and love.

The fact that not the entire platform of Bernie will be accepted by the Democratic party does not prevent that a beginning towards it was made. Yes. it will take many years of repeated fighting to get some of his issues to take root. But it will come. For the simple reason that people know that it would well be possible: Bernie has shown that in the details he gives on his website. How it will be possible to pay for the measures and that it will not increase taxes excessively. In addition, he wants to rebuild the infrastructure. That would create scores of well-paid jobs. They will increase the tax basis, which will make payment for Bernie&apos;s issues even more easy.

What you say, that the Dem Party will adopt a socialist platform only if a Republican wins the presidency - maybe so. But in this case the opponent is Trump, who largely advocates similar changes as Bernie, accomplished with different means. That would then be ideal in forcing the Dem party into Bernie&apos;s issues.

We should not be so concerned about Trump, as much as we should be concerned about the "handlers" he chooses.  (i.e.: Dick Cheney & Co. with "party boy" G.W. Bush.)

Thank you John.  I always enjoy listening to you and reading you.  I have followed Bernie Sanders since he started his campaign on the Thom Hartmann show many years ago.  As any good political strategist knows you always make a move or a movement for more than just one reason. 
 In my opinion, Bernie is right to take his agenda to the floor of the convention and work hard to make it stick.  Bernie understands that he is fighting for the soul of the Democratic party, of democracy and of the nation itself.  Our constitution starts with, "We the people", not we the CEOs.

Time for Bernie to step up and walk the talk by pledging $25 million of the $186 million he&apos;s raised so far to supporting 25 progressive candidates for the Senate and 25 progressive candidates for the House.  By campaigning for other progressives he can rise above the ego gratification of being the talking revolution by becoming a true leader who can really transform American politics.  Party platforms can be wonderful words, but electing progressives is the only way to trnaform the Congress and, hopefully, get some important thongs done.

It is not "his money" to give away.  It belongs to his contributors.  They intended it for him and/or the political revolution.  If you had your money on him, you would understand.  The only "progressive" endorsement supporting his revolution in the Senate is Merkley (D-OR)

I agree except he doesn&apos;t have it. He is spending almost every $$$ he raises trying to keep his own campaign going. That&apos;s the soft underbelly of the small donor campaign he is running, and shows why, as remarkable as it has been, that it isn&apos;t a winning strategy.

No, genius. Do you live in a bubble?
If Sanders had the media hoopla that Trump enjoyed, it would be a Sanders landslide-strategy.  I&apos;m sure there is "buyer&apos;s remorse" today among voters in the early primary "Hillbilly Heaven"  States that voted for Clinton, because they had never heard of Sanders at the time they voted.  Sanders has done incredible well for someone with virtually No MS media exposure (until he started winning) and treated like a pariah by the very party in which he is a candidate.

Simone Weil worked out what happens to our institutions with mathematical precision.  By partaking in the nature of social reality, they come to belong – not to the ultimate good – but to the realm of the necessary.  Precisely what the alternative is, isn&apos;t specified.  However we could stop kidding ourselves.  The choice we&apos;re making is to perpetuate systems of power and oppression.

1. Hillary is ahead by 337 (pledged) delegates, not 800. The larger  figure includes superdelegates who have stated their fealty to the Clintons. They could change their vote at any time up to the moment they cast their ballot at the convention. But the corporate media has been counting them as though they are pledged, elected delegates who are required to vote for the candidate they represent. This has clearly been an attempt by the corporate media since early in the campaign to demoralize & demobilize Bernie supporters into giving up, thinking the race is over. It is NOT.  2. While platform fights should not be ignored, they should not be overestimated either. Remember that Obama ran on the Public Option but gave us the Individual Mandate Heritage Foundation Health Care Plan. Similarly, Clinton was explicitly opposed to NAFTA - until he got in office, pushed it through Congress & signed it. Does anyone seriously believe that Hillary will stand by anything placed in the platform that seriously harms the interests of the Clintons&apos; corporate backers?

Two enormous craters undermine the Democratic Party and the viability of democracy in this country: first, the party is corrupt and dead set against the voters who one way and another are protesting its positions and procedures, and second, surveying the fifty state scene, the voter registration procedures that are a shambles preventing more political participation  were implemented and are defended in large part by state Democratic parties.
In the good America, election days would be celebrations of empowerment, locally run, fully transparent, with paper ballots and honest, bipartisan scrutiny of the vote count. They would follow campaigns open to all comers, with free and equal media access, so that, as Martin Luther King Jr. wanted, even a garbage collector could mount a competitive campaign for local office: in short, Democracy!

The President of the United States, Governor of New York State, & Mayor of New York City are all Democrats. Yet in the recent primary, 125,000 Democratic voter were crossed off the rolls FROM BERNIE SANDERS HOME BOROUGH - Brooklyn! This was the only county of the 60+ in New York State that lost voters. It is no longer possible to attribute voter suppression & fraud to the GOP alone.

Do you see a conspiracy in every tea pot?  Voter rolls are maintained by individual districts.  Every district works and cleans up its rolls.  Brooklyn is one of the biggest places for dem votes in the state: perhaps the biggest. It wasn&apos;t a conspiracy against voters or against Bernie: it was workers trying to groom their rolls, keep them up to date.
Yes they may have made mistakes, but assigning malice to it is absurd.  NYC like many urban areas has considerable mobility: people move a great deal. Because where you vote is based on where you live, if you move then you are no longer lawfully registered.  It is up to folks to update their registration. Folks who move, who aren&apos;t at the addresses they registered at, and folks who have not voted in two presidential cycles are understandably cleaned from the system.  
Did some folks get scrubbed by mistake?  Did some folks not send back their notification cards?  Did some people&apos;s notification cards come back undeliverable?  
But was there a conspiracy to disenfranchise?  That is where your accusation falls apart as whooly made up and completely absurd.

I was puzzled and bewildered by reading that Hillary Clinton has kept for her campaign much of the money she allegedly raised for down ballot candidates.  It seems as if she has shamelessly  violated the campaign financing laws, weak as they are.  I want to vote for a Democrat, but I can&apos;t support someone who seems to be corrupt in this manner.  I hope she can somehow contradict the statements made in today&apos;s Politico article.

The political revolution needs to keep going.  I hope Bernie will keep reminding and leading us.  We will see what a charged-up group of citizens can do.  We will stay informed.  We will vote.  We will write and petition.  We will march in the streets.  Enough of us have already voted for Bernie to change things IF WE KEEP UP THE FIGHT.

The Democratic establishment has underestimated the anger which exists within the party.  I am voting for Sanders, period.  I think many others in the party feel the same.  I am tired of the Establishment feeding corruption to its members as being normal.

Perhaps platform fights are worth waging but not because they result in important policies being put in party platforms. They are almost invariably not accepted by the party and its front-runner and only outside forces turn the tide and eventually decide the issues as matters of national policy and law.  Party platforms are just rhetoric. And in 2016, if Clinton wins, there will be none of Bernie&apos;s planks to any significant degree if at all. Read Ralph Nader&apos;s take on this here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ralph-nader/the-long-distance-rebound_b_9811888.html?utm_hp_ref=politics

Good article, and good advice.  I expect no less from John Nichols, and he rarely if ever disappoints.

But as for the usual torrent of Hillary Derangement Syndrome comments that attach themselves to every Nation campaign article:  I look forward to reading the comments of these people when Sanders goes out on the campaign trail for Clinton after the convention.  It wouldn&apos;t surprise me a bit if these same people would then re-direct their wrath at Bernie the "sellout"!  Thank God for the future of this country that Bernie Sanders, rightly determined as he is to carry his campaign to the finish, doesn&apos;t share the dangerous illusion that Hillary is nothing but GOP Lite.

A convention fight empowers Trump.  Bernie wants his agenda to triumph but he (and Nichols) miss the fact that a more moderate agenda triumphed already.  They also miss that Hillary in 2008 was so much closer in delegates but still got nothing in the platform.
Sanders lost and lost badly.  It wasn&apos;t close.  
The Sanders campaign is in disarray, changing its message and goals every newscycle, contradicting itself endlessly.  He&apos;ll be lucky to get an afternoon speaking slot at the convention right now.
His campaign engaged in a process and lost.  He was able to outspend his opponent in almost every state, opted for tons of advertising instead of really organizing almost every state, and still lost.  He picked small caucus states he could win for the optics rather than fighting in the big states that mattered and he lost almost every debate by using his huge chunks of his stump speech for almost every answer.  
He was un-electable at the start of the primary contest and he remains un-electable now.
If he decided to go third party we will know by May 9, the deadline for an important state.  As a third party candidate he will lose, and cause Hillary to lose, thus causing Trump to win.  
That will be some legacy: Nader to the tenth power.
Nichols is talking nonsense here again.

You spread tripe like peanut butter.

I&apos;m wondering where you get your news. Sanders isn&apos;t "losing big."  It now looks very unlikely that Clinton will not reach the decisive number of pledged delegates to make her the clear winner. Even if she does, she has hardly had a clean sweep. But all this playground talk aside, it never seems to occur to staunch Democrats that the reason for their losing might not be a "divided party," per se, but the reason those divisions occurred in the first place. That narrative of Nader/Gore ignores some important facts, like how, in the few debates between Al Gore and Bill Bradley -- whose primary attempt was shut down early -- Gore ran from the issues of abortion rights and gun legislation and touted his support of the first Gulf War. It&apos;s a false assumption, but a convenient one for Democrats, that Nader&apos;s supporters would have voted for Gore in Nader&apos;s absence. They probably wouldn&apos;t have voted at all. Given the platforms of a conservative Democrat and a "compassionate conservative" 50-50 is exactly how you would have expected the vote to come down. Another impotant oversight of the divided party narrative in 2016 is that Sanders was not peeling off Clinton voters, he brought in new independents and brought back many disenchanted Reagan Democrats from middle America. The party ignores that at their own peril.

Nader did not make much difference.  Gore received more popular votes than Bush country wide.  We all know what happened in Florida.

Nannette,  Why would I say Bernie has lost big?  He is behind by 800 delegates.  He can&apos;t win, and most reasonable people have seen that since South Carolina, after which he was down by 181 pledged delegates- a margin we all know from living through 2008&apos;s fight is not winnable.  Since then he has fallen further behind, winning mostly just small caucus states.  
Calling me a staunch democrat doesn&apos;t change the math in any way.  Bernie brought back Reagan democrats?  I have yet to see any evidence at all.  Half of all registered independents lean left and vote democratic, where as half of all independents lean right and vote loyally for republicans, so are you sure that Bernie brought new voters in?  Are you saying that Bill Clinton didn&apos;t get independents and that Barack didn&apos;t?  They both got a great many.  Are you sure Bernie got new voters?  voting is down by 30 percent since 2008 in many states on the democratic side: it sounds as though not too many new voters showed up at all.
Hillary is ahead by three million voters: that is quite a beating by any standard: that would make a good margin of victory in a general election, even!

You are exaggerating by t least half a million (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/05/hillary-clinton/does-clinton-really-have-25-million-more-votes-san/) and overlooking the fact that so many Democratic primaries are closed.

First of all you&apos;re counting super delegates, which shouldn&apos;t be counted yet. Secondly, Without all the closed primaries, voter suppression, and election fraud, Hillary most likely would not be ahead.  I have no idea how you can say Bernie has changed his stance on issues. He&apos;s had the same message throughout this election. You must be confusing him with Hillary who constantly flip flops and adopts Bernie&apos;s messages when she sees it will attract voters. If she gets into the White House, she&apos;ll abandon these new positions and revert back to her Republican lite stances, while serving her many donors as she always has.

Tanya,

Super delegates are part of the math for the democratic nomination.  They were for Obama in 2008 and they are now, however inconvenient that is to Bernie&apos;s fantasies and yours.  They count just as much as pledged delegates, and they make clear who will win and who will lose.  Your shoulda-coulda-woulda suppositions about &apos;Bernie would have won if only...&apos; are really a non-factor in deciding the next few weeks.  Bernie lost.  
As for whether it is 3 million or 2 and a half million, it hardly matters which is correct but CNN and 538 in recent days have said it was 3 million: the point remains that Bernie is millions behind in total votes and leaning on polls to counter real votes and real delegates is pretty silly and transparent.
My point about Bernie changing his campaigns message in recent days was that he and Tad and his wife and Weaver are all saying contradictory things about the race now, their aims and intentions, and that these constant changes indicate they have no path forward and can&apos;t agree on goals.
Mostly it seems very clear that they are determined to try and bluff their way through the next few weeks, to pretend that they are trying to win to keep people voting for them and top keep that rented plane in the air and mostly just to avoid going back to his seat in the senate and doing his job.  His campaign failed.   It ended.  He just won&apos;t admit it.  Supporters like you are arguing whether he should admit he lost yet or whether he is down by 2 and a half million or three million votes.  
If Hillary gets into the White House, she will be flexible and move the democratic progressive ball forward.  I bet flexibility is a hall mark of your relationships and your work life but amazingly Bernie fans and Hillary Haters have cast it as a horrible quality for Hillary or the party to have.

Unfortunately you can&apos;t keep independents and republicans from voting in a general election.  The closed primary system is hardly representative of broader voter will.

If Bernie wants to get Progressive policies on a platform, he&apos;ll have better luck with Trump than Hillary.  Does he want warmongering, or war as an absolute last resort?  Does he want war with Russia, or to normalize relations with Russia (as argued for by Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen F. Cohen)?  Does he want more regime change, or does he want actual change?  All of Bernie&apos;s eloquent words about trade, and the disastrous nature of the TPP/TTIP/TiSA have been echoed by Trump, but not by Hillary.  War, Trade, Wall Street, Money in Politics - are those the things that are important, or is it just identity politics as usual?

This is just one reason that HRC will have real trouble in the General.

Yes, platform fights are worth waging... but,
"It does not mean that he [Bernie] will get what he wants at the convention [regarding the platform]. It does not mean that Hillary Clinton, who has her own vision and her own strategies, should [would] accept every [any] proposal that Sanders or broader movements make. There are no guarantees that the Democratic Party can or will run in 2016 on “the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.” 

This is a significant reason we should not nominate Clinton.

I hope the stars align for Bernie to run as an Independent presidential candidate.

I agree I want my vote to count on where I want to see America go.  I&apos;ll be holding my breath for Bernie to win the nomination but if not he should consider going Green.

Dennis and Steve, I completely agree that votes should count and that Clinton is the lesser candidate.  Senator Sanders has caused an earthquake, by speaking truth to power.  However, he is not so naive, after holding electoral office for decades, to imagine that magical thinking will result in perfect results in the wave of a wand.  That is why his comments as reported here have such resonance.  

The situation is complex, but not immune to change.  If Senator Sanders is not the nominee, and he has admitted that possibility , but not lost hope; he is asking those who agree with his agenda to work in the long haul.

The analogies made here to the civil rights movement are correct.  They did not happen overnight.  But they did happen, the vision of those who worked for decades was achieved in legislation, and that is all a politician can really do.  

President Trump?  That horrible possibility, along with the SCOTUS nominees he will appoint,  seems to be closer, if those who oppose his views choose not to vote for the only remaining viable opposition, or not vote at all.  

I don&apos;t like HRC, but I like the vision of the bible clobbered, brain dead, infantile narcissists with no or an evil plan, who will be running in opposition to her far less.   

HRC, if she ascends to the throne, will have done so with a vision that is opaque, but I don&apos;t think she wants her implementation to go down in history as the first woman president who helped destroy the country.

The Republicans have a faint hope that disillusionment will keep you at home or writing a candidate in a lost cause.  Don&apos;t give them that opportunity.

The Queen of England, an actual queen, has very little power; her position is largely ceremonial.  The Brits like their monarchy... up to a point.  Unlike so many of her predecessors, she no longer has the power to bring the country down around everyone&apos;s ears through the blowback of her ill considered decisions.  &apos;Make it so&apos;.  


Hillary, on the other hand, could bring destruction upon us all, if she got enough of her cabinet to comply.  But I envision her doing exactly what so many who support her hope she will do -- maintain the status quo of the meritocracy, and the inequality that goes with it.  Neo-liberalism has been very, very good for them.  She won&apos;t reign in the political and financial excesses of the billionaires; she won&apos;t break up the banks; she won&apos;t raise the minimum wage to $15; she won&apos;t fight for universal medicare; and her stands on Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Middle East will remain exacting the same.  


So we&apos;ll have another 4-8 years of &apos;more of the same&apos;, and that&apos;s going to be destructive in and of itself.  It&apos;s so much harder to affix responsibility on to a president for doing nothing, plausible deniability is built in.

The progressive left or social liberal wing of the Democratic party has a leader. I am willing to follow his lead and move on to the convention with even more delegates in the bag. I am relishing a huge fight in and out of the convention. Yippee!

Does anyone sincerely believe that Hillary Clinton can do any of the things Sanders suggests?  Or that she is even willing to try?
The one thing people should have taken away from watching Clinton over a couple decades now is how she insists on offering crumbs to her constituents under the guise of "working within the system" e.g. Walmart.  She has done so little for women (her main constituency) I really wish women who rally for her would wake up and realize-she is NOT who she purports to be.
As to the platform, over the years they&apos;ve mattered less and less.  And always remember Hillary&apos;s words at the 96 convention:  "A leaner, meaner, Democrat party."  She has no intention of bucking anyone, even for women&apos;s causes.  Look what Walmart is today.

In the 1980&apos;s Wal Mart had an ad campaign touting how they buy American made first, "If it&apos;s made in America". 
I have followed them and their shelf stock since. What I noticed was that yes many products, clothing in particular were made in America. But, there was something missing from the labels. "Union Made". HRC was on the board back then "fighting for women&apos;s and children&apos;s rights in the boardroom. So we are told. What was not told was as Sam Walton and Co was promoting this, Sam was dictating to his suppliers that they had to move production to China in order to sell to Wal Mart the low price leader. DWS, HRC and the DNC will have us believe HRC was not privy to this. I don&apos;t buy that.
I also don&apos;t buy HRC as a progressive, not with her track record both public and private. 
As senator Sanders pointed out; You can not stand for and with the oppressed while being financed by the oppressors.

The voices from the HRC side of the road seem to indicate that they have already moved (too) far to the left and that they are going to resist further movement. This is a clear indication that the DLC still holds sway, and that the centrist/incrementalist is still the perfect Clinton.

As usual, Mr. Nichols strikes the right consonant notes. I hope the DNC&apos;s DWS, who is also running for her political life, reads this. And the accompanying pair of articles by Steve Phillips drives home the point that JFK made decades ago (I paraphrase): "If not us, who? if not now, when?"

Watching and listening to all the sturm und drang for the past year, I hope it is I, and everyone else who gives a damn about this country&apos;s future, and that the time is now.

“AN INDISPENSABLE VOICE IN OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE.”
