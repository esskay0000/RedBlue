Washington (CNN)House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the prospects of his Thursday meeting with Donald Trump leading to a big political breakthrough in a round of interviews on Tuesday, but stressed his focus is unifying a fractured Republican Party.

I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!
