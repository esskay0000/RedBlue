Likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday knocked Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy judgment in a video ad released on social media that focuses on the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

The short clip takes aim at confusion over what caused the attacks on a diplomatic compound that was initially linked by Obama administration officials to rage over an anti-Muslim video released online. The September 2012 attacks left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

“Hillary has bad judgment!” Trump wrote on Instagram, where he released the clip before tweeting it out to his 8 million Twitter followers.

Hillary has bad judgment!

Critics of the former secretary of state have accused her of lying about the cause of the attacks. She has dismissed those claims, and independent fact checkers – including The Post’s Fact Checker – have concluded that she herself did not blame the attacks on the video, although she regularly spoke about protests sparked by the video.

"We've seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video," Clinton is seen saying at the beginning of the clip released Tuesday by Trump.

"She lied to me, she told me it was the fault of the video," says Patricia Smith, the mother of one of the victims, in footage that flashes on screen from an interview with Fox Business.

Trump has regularly criticized Clinton’s foreign policy judgment on the campaign trail. He has escalated his attacks on Clinton in recent days ahead of a potential general-election fight against her, accusing her of being “trigger happy” on military interventions and blaming her for failures in Libya.

The clip ends with footage of Clinton laughing, as dramatic flames appear superimposed in the clip. “Never forget!” reads a closing caption.
