Reince Priebus thinks that Donald Trump being the Republican nominee might be the unique jolt his party needs.

“You know what, I think something different and something new is probably good for our party,” the chairman of the Republican National Committee told CNN’s New Day Wednesday.

On Tuesday night, Priebus tweeted his support — and a call for his fractured party to come together — for Trump after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz dropped out of the race following a crushing blow in the Indiana primary.

While Priebus is all-in on Trump, he admitted on Wednesday he didn’t see Trump in the 2016 tea leaves a year ago.

“I don't think anyone predicted what happened,” Priebus said. “So, look, we're here.  We're going to get behind the presumptive nominee.  I stated the obvious in the tweet. Obviously, you still have to get to 1,237 delegates.”
