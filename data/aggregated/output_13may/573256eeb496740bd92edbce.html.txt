When you enter the room
You destroy the room, the room
You waited so long to enter—
No: “to get into,” to be allowed
To enter and so on. A nod
To Kafka, existentialism, theories
Of desire…blah blah blah.
You’re talking to yourself
Now. When you enter (too late,
Too early, over or underdressed,
Etc) the room
explodes? No. Is
Missing? Almost. No. But no. Maybe…
Dissolves, becoming the room
You could get into. Welcome.
