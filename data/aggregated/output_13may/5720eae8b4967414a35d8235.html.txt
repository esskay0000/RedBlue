Despite winning 49 New York counties to Hillary Clinton’s 13, and more votes in the state than Donald Trump and John Kasich combined, Bernie Sanders is not going to be the next president of the United States. For those of us who really thought he might, his defeat here hits especially hard. The temptation to abandon ourselves to recrimination and despair will be strong. Yet it must be resisted.

For one thing, Sanders himself fights on, in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Oregon, and California: states where he can continue to inspire a movement and upend the “pragmatic incrementalism” that marks the limits of conventional politics. It also makes no sense to walk away in the middle of a debate that Sanders is winning on every issue, from a $15 minimum wage to the disastrous legacy of pro-corporate trade deals, to the need for massive reinvestment in our inner cities, to the rejection of a foreign policy founded on regime change. Workers who have seen their jobs shipped overseas; all those left behind by the Clinton-era boom, as well as the millions who lost a home in the Bush recession or remain excluded from the skewed Obama recovery—they still need a voice, and a champion, in this election.		
I spent the day before the vote in Wyckoff Gardens, three crumbling gray-brick towers in the heart of Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill, built in the 1960s and neglected for the past half-century. “People think we’re all on welfare,” said resident Beverly Corbin. “People in public housing are teachers, engineers, social workers, corrections officers. We are a community!” I asked my guides—a half-dozen fiercely articulate African-American women belonging to Families United for Racial and Economic Equality—how they were going to vote, and was surprised that a majority said they were “feeling the Bern.” Yet when Stephen Levin, the 34-year-old city councilman whose office arranged my visit, revealed that he was backing Clinton, there was no animosity.		
“You were there for us after Hurricane Sandy,” said Charlene Nimmons, the former president of the tenants’ association. “And we need you with us now.” She was speaking about their fight against a move by the city to turn a parking lot at one end of the development into market-rate housing. For these women, and millions like them, politics isn’t a hobby, but rather a fight for survival. And as he has shown on the streets of Brownsville and on the picket line in Buffalo, there is no more courageous ally than Bernie Sanders. Now is no time for him, or those inspired by his message, to leave the field.		
Yet while the struggle continues, the goal has changed. Winning the White House was a thrilling dream. Winning power—durable power, the kind that makes laws and holds elected officials to account—is a longer, more grueling fight. That, however, is the task we face now. In the coming weeks, Sanders and his supporters will need to make clear exactly what he’s fighting for, both inside the Democratic Party and beyond. As his campaign officials rightly point out, Sanders’s support keeps growing. He may well win more states, and will arrive at the convention with enough delegates to push not just for a progressive platform but for procedural changes—such as an end to superdelegates or a ban on PAC money in primaries—that could level the playing field for the next generation of insurgents. He could also demand the appointment of party officials less addicted to corporate cash. In the meantime, he could direct a lot more of his attention and money to candidates down the ticket who share his politics.

The WFP model of fusion politics—using the opening created by New York’s election laws to build an independent power base by endorsing progressive Democrats without playing a spoiler role—may not be the answer nationwide: Thousands of WFP members worked hard for Sanders, but in New York’s closed primary, many of them couldn’t vote for him. It’s not a bad place to start thinking, though, about how to heal the terrible racial fissure that split progressives in what is arguably the most progressive state in the country.

Very few of the actual numbers of Sanders supporters were able to cast their ballots in the New York primary, that was obvious. 

Supporters of Bernie Sanders should continue to push on with efforts to elect him president. I just sent his campaign another donation. I believe no cause is more important at the present time.

Does no one remember the picture of Harry Truman holding the newspaper that shows,in large,bold letters:"Dewey defeats Truman!!" ? Nothing in the upcoming election is a done deal. I have a large circle of friends who support Sanders,and distrust HRC. The entire process has to play out before we can declare anything.
I am a loyal Bernie supporter. Trump is a horrible person,and I do not trust HRC to be anything but the same-old,same-old.

Mr. Guttenplan, You expect the results of a fraudulent election in NY to deter a revolution?  If so, I don&apos;t think you ever were much of a Bernie supporter, so go ahead and support whomever you wish, but don&apos;t expect people whose principles are controverted by your secret crush, HRC, to simply fall into line alongside you and behind her.  You do have one thing right, though, the Democratic party needs us --but if HRC is nominated, we do not need that Democratic Party.  Not holding my nose to vote for anyone this time around.  I am voting for Bernie in California and we are moving at full-speed here to bring our candidate, our cause, to victory.  Bernie Sanders will be the next U.S. President.

Sorry Katherine,
Didn&apos;t mean to jack your thread.  This should have been a new post, but I don&apos;t see a way to edit it, and it is too long to double post.  JN

I don&apos;t see a new 3rd Party presidential effort as effective by November.  Think Perot, Nader, John Anderson or even George Wallace.
But Voting  Third Party because an existing candidate (Green, Libertarian, Wobbly or Independent) better expresses your positions is an effective way to use your voice.
It is possible to move the "D" Party without supporting Clinton.
There may be a "Slash and burn" strategy, but I don&apos;t see the advantage.  Democrats lost to "W", and it is easy to show the math which proves a few progressive positions would have won Florida, or other states to make Florida irrelevant.  They didn&apos;t learn, but reverted to the neoliberal "Third Way" strategy and lost mid-terms and the next Presidential cycle.  Obama showed how to add progressives and build a winning coalition, then they reverted to form and lost mid-terms and shrunk Obama&apos;s victory next round. Now they are going back to the losing strategy with Clinton.  Showing her a loss is not going to teach them a lesson.
Vote for the lesser of two evils if you want, or Don&apos;t vote for Clinton if she doesn&apos;t credibly support your positions and you think 4 years of Trump may not be any worse than 8 years of Clinton.  
<p>
But DO NOW:
Use the local Democratic primaries to replace establishment Democrats down-ballot with Progressives.  The "Pivot to the Down-ballot" candidates are easy to find on the internet, support with $27 and with the same volunteer support groups, able to reach across jurisdictions with the skills and software developed to support Bernie.
Do organize and support progressives down-ballot in November.  There are even a handful of non-Democrats with a possible shot to pick off Democans and Republicrats, or at least give them a good run, and Progressive Democrats can replace Republicans to counter whichever non-progressive gains the White House if Bernie is not at the top of the ballot.
Meanwhile, Sanders is not done.  The math shows it is unlikely Clinton will have the "Pledged" delegates to win on the first ballot if the Sanders campaign pushes as hard or harder through the West Coast.  Clinton is in the same position as Trump: The "D" Convention will be just as "Open" or "Brokered" as the Republicans - the difference being Clinton claims to have done the "Brokering" in advance through whatever levers move Superdelegates.
Lets take as many delegates as possible to the convention, Nominate Bernie from the floor, and make our case to the convention in the naïve hope that rationality will prevail.
If it doesn&apos;t (and even if it does) we can do all of the above while planning and organizing past November, and deciding what role the Democratic Party will play in our movement&apos;s future.

I started writing this as a reply to a comment, but I realized it was for "The Nation" and DDG.  
So either you haven&apos;t been paying attention, or you don&apos;t believe or care about Hillary&apos;s history, associations, political choices, serial changes in positions, auto-immunity from rules and regulations, and fancy financial footwork.  She is not a leader, she is a follower, of the powerful interests that are taking full advantage of her blind ambition.
On the other hand, Bernie Sanders got elected to the Senate with 25% of Republican votes.  Nicer to work with Republicans than "fight" them for the cameras, while hobnobbing with them in monied social circles.  Trump and Kissinger come to mind.
I want my money back from The Nation.  What cowards.  In a revolution, things would not go well with people like you at our side.
We are fighting for our country.  For democracy.  For voting rights.  For the end of "privatization."  For social justice.  For economic justice.  For the idea of America.  It may make you think you are sophisticated to accept corruption and the status quo, to acquiesce to the DNC&apos;s call for "unity" but your willingness just makes you look jaded and dead inside.  And the fact that you can write such lukewarm drivel for nationally published articles is maddening.

What a bunch of sore losers in the comments. Get over it, Sir Galahad is not going to be president. I know, you quit voting years ago, saving yourself for just this moment, so this is doubly hard for you drama queens to swallow.  But let&apos;s be honest, you have been the problem all those years when the drama just hasn&apos;t reached the level to bring you out in off year elections. And now, suddenly, holy moly, you somehow think you are "the revolution".  Revolutions never start at the top and work their way down. No, really, this isn&apos;t a movie, it doesn&apos;t work that way. It doesn&apos;t start in the Oval Office, it starts at the State House, and the GOP now controls 68 out of 98 of those due to your addiction to drama. You want a revolution, that&apos;s where it happens. Why do you think the Kochs are spending far more money on rolling state legislatures than on presidential campaigns.  So far, you are the problem. But, you can be part of the solution. Senator Sanders will have the delegates to mold the party platform - usually a meaningless piece of paper. But, he&apos;s going to be the most powerful Senator next year and can hold Clinton&apos;s feet to the fire. To do that he&apos;s going to need you to stay involved, even when the drama dies down and there&apos;s work to be done, like finding out who your state representative is, you know, dull stuff.  Are you going to do it? Of course not. There&apos;s far more drama in sulking and being the victim of some grand conspiracy to not take you seriously.

Obviously you&apos;re one of the Hillbots sent here by David Brock&apos;s "Distort the Record." Well, it&apos;s not going to work. You can never bring people to your side with berating, shaming, insulting vitriol. As I recall, their goal is to destroy and delegitimize Bernie, and then in some kind of a Kumbaya moment," bring the party together later." Ain&apos;t gonna happen, on either count.

I&apos;m assuming from your condescending tone and moronic generality, "So far, you (?) are the problem"(progressives? Bernie supporters? anyone who doesn&apos;t agree with you?), that you must be part of the solution. Or maybe you just have an over-inflated sense of self worth, like so many smug do-nothing democrats? Anybody who&apos;s capable of paying attention, knows that from the very  beginning,  Bernie has stressed that it doesn&apos;t happen from the top down and the revolution needs to be grass roots and fought in the trenches. That doesn&apos;t mean we should roll over and lick the corporate democratic party&apos;s boots and vote the party line, at their command. That wouldn&apos;t actually be much of a revolution, would it, O great hero of the revolution? Most true progressives I&apos;ve been exposed to tend to be better informed, more politically active and more likely to vote ( although they may not vote the way you like). While, most traditional Dems I know, are more likely to be uninformed (the 11 o&apos; clock news), unmotivated and express such well thought out and nuanced views as &apos;Democrats good - Republicans bad&apos; or "I think we need a woman president ( because it seems so liberal, not like those sexist repubs )" without any consideration of who that woman is. Talk about sore loser drama queens, every time the Democrats lose an election (which they are very good at), due to their lack of imagination and inspiration, stultifying hubris and of course, the dirty little secret that they are in bed with and owned by big money corporate America (just like the republicans), they blame the progressives. So "answer me this Mister Wizard"- do tell us all what your great involvement is. Have you run for a seat at one of those State houses you are so worried about? Or perhaps you went door to door trying to help elect local city officials for the cause? Or maybe you put your body on the line and protested injustice and were arrested, trying to do the right thing? Or, more than likely, you are just a loyal Democratic blow hard, drama queen pre- blaming others for your anticipated loss.

DISGUSTING

So this is what The Nation&apos;s endorsement of Bernie Sanders amounts to?  Thanks for nothing.

So this is how much The Nation&apos;s endorsement of Bernie Sanders was worth?  Thanks for nothing.

Even the NY Times has a more even-handed headline about the NY primary than The Nation.   Compare "Sanders Faces Narrower Road.." to "Bernie Sanders Is Not Going to Be President..."    Unbelievable.    And this guy has been running equivocating articles about Sanders now for the past month.   "The tone of the campaign needs to change"?   DDG can cover his a__, keep his job, and feel confident that the climate will hold up in London long enough that he&apos;ll live out his remaining years in relative comfort.  Many Americans, especially the younger ones, are realizing that they don&apos;t have that luxury.

Terrific!  Thank you.  This is just the right tone.  Progressives together -- behind Hillary once she&apos;s nominated.  
Bob Gippin, President, Summit County Progressive Democrats
Akron, Ohio

4/8/14 I witnessed HRC state "gridlock in DC is due to 2 Extremes. The Tea Party and Progressives."  Now she claims to be a Progressive. Not to mention Iraq, Honduras, Libya and 38 civil suits over the emails. HRC will be nothing but additional scandal and another sellout. NO THANK YOU!

DDG writes, "Workers who have seen their jobs shipped overseas; all those left behind by the Clinton-era boom..."  What "boon" - DDG, are you nuts?

No matter what the outcome of the election, Sanders participation has done what previously was not possible:  taken the shroud off of Hillary Clinton, the cover she has lived in since 92.   I myself was amazed as the last couple of years unfolded and I found out all I ever did not want to hear about HRC.
The karmic brilliance of Sanders exists in a world beyond winners and losers of the Democratic nomination.  Bernie&apos;s generosity just serves to show us (for free, Hilary!) who and what she is.  For each of Sanders stripes as a giver, we are revealed Hilary&apos;s equivalencies as taker/hoarder.  She has cultivated a lie of a personality within the framework of the DNC.  She may get elected and do a few nice things. but she has been exposed as the greedmeister she really is, and it will never go away.

It&apos;s not your right to say that, DDG.  You are like all the other political fat heads.

Simple question: which Supreme Court justice do you prefer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Clarence Thomas? RBG was nominated by Bill Clinton, Thomas by the guy he defeated. Let&apos;s get over ourselves.

I would prefer Bernie Sanders pick the next Supreme Court Justice rather than Hillary Clinton. Hillary is more right wing than her husband, she is far to the right of a Dwight Eisenhower, and Eisenhower picked Earl Warren.

﻿ Eisenhower didn&apos;t "pick" Warren. Warren was governor of California. To get Warren to switch California&apos;s convention delegates away from Taft to vote for him ﻿ Eisenhower had to promise Warren a nomination to the SCOTUS. It just so happened that the next vacancy was the Chief Justice. ﻿ Warren and the California Senator and ﻿ Eisenhower&apos;s VP pick, Richard Nixon, were bitter enemies and ﻿ Eisenhower despised Warren. Warren has been Taft&apos;s running mate 4 years earlier and ﻿ Eisenhower wanted Warren on the Court to keep him from challenging him in 1956. Warren took the bait, planning to use his confirmation hearings as a springboard his 1956 campaign. Brown v. Board of Education was part of that rivalry. Warren thought ﻿Eisenhower would take the backlash enforcing it, but﻿ Eisenhower deftly branded Warren and it stuck. 

You see, politics has always been like this. Indeed, things are really quite calm these days in comparison.

Eisenhower chose (actually appointed) Warren to be Chief Justice in September 1953 when the current Chief Justice died. Eisenhower was the sitting President that year and Warren was later confirmed by a unanimous vote.

Proving only that voting for president is not a promise of a certain quality Supreme Court nomination, particularly given no promise of a friendly Senate confirmation, to which Clinton will likely make triangulation deals; while Clinton would certainly be the neocon military president and the tool of the big money interests, with the same cooperation that Republicans gave her husband.
The "Supreme Court" threat is used every 4 years.  It is not the only issue in a presidential campaign, and may well not be the most important. It may be the ploy that has prevented progressive issues from being addressed. In other words, I&apos;m not convinced this justifies a Clinton Presidency.

Yes, there was a Clinton era boon. And no deficit.

I think that "Boon" was called computers, and ended after the Clintons promoted the trade deals to move those jobs overseas.

The general election isn&apos;t going to be Clinton vs Sanders, it&apos;s going to be Clinton vs GOP.

One could define it as {Clinton/GOP} vs. progressive values.  The question is what to do about that.

Kudos Dwayne, Charles and James for timely insights.  Very troubling times indeed. For DJ to think the Bernie supporters - very highly principled, authentic and attentive to nuances and sick of what they&apos;ve witnessed from hordes of top Democratic leaders(yes, super delegates too - even lobbyists) - will rush to Hillary&apos;s defense is an overreach.  Yeah, we&apos;ve been conditioned to vote for the least worst - always to save us from cataclysmic disaster for most of our lives.  But Susan Sarandon was right on when I heard her answer Chris Hayes&apos; question about fear of a Trump presidency.  I felt her sentiments .  And that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;d ever vote for Trump either.  He does sicken me more than the Clintons.  Very scary to have to choose between those two. But I won&apos;t feel responsible for Hillary losing to him (or any right wing talking head) or feel guilty beforehand when the party shills, media profiteers, and sophisticated know it alls on cable tv try to blame any and all who dislike Hillary for her disapproval rating.  She deserves it and much worse.  Watching her again, for weeks, flip flopping (remember the early bantering about who was more progressive? PUHLEEASE!) and smugly attacking Bernie with half truths, innuendo and outright lies would be enough to never support her.  I stand to lose my last "skin in the game" with Bernie being ousted by the obviously rigged Democratic system which seems as corrupt as the GOP&apos;s with their handling of this primary.  I couldn&apos;t vote in NY - not registered as a Democrat - would have needed to be extremely astute (last October was our deadline for switching parties as to be eligible to vote in this primary).  Why not, at the very least, a reasonable deadline for people to grudgingly switch their party affiliation to one or the other of the corrupt parties we have to choose from?  Don&apos;t they realize how many independent, liberal, Working Families Party, etc. voters have been voting for Democrats regularly for years (knowing the GOP candidates were worse and more dangerous)? 
But when a real game changer comes on the scene(I&apos;ve followed him and liked him long before he made this ultimate sacrifice) and is mocked and derided by all the gurus as an afterthought... and keeps gaining momentum, preaching a platform to address the very issues this country MUST FACE BOLDLY...who can blame us for being fed up.  While Hillary is maxing out with sick money from the forces that are ruining our country&apos;s efforts to level the playing field a smidgen, acting like she wouldn&apos;t do their bidding...even if it ruins more lives and enables them to amass fortunes beyond anyone&apos;s wildest dreams.  $350,000 a couple dinners... Wasserman Schultz attacking Warren for wanting to pass legislation to reign in predatory lenders and bank fraudsters preying on our most vulnerable ... wanting to see Bernie&apos;s tax returns when she out earns his yearly earnings  with 1 speech to her masters... and on and on.  Who in their right mind would jump to the defense of this and call themselves  progressive? The status quo is wrecking the country day by day and has been for years.  The need for a 3rd party or a 4th is long overdue.  Why not mobilize all Bernie&apos;s supporters (is 7 million accurate?) to run as a 3rd party? More blame of  Ralph Nader for that fixed outcome?? Or a 4th party if the Republican zillionaire backers don&apos;t want to take a chance with Trump and he follows through with his threat.  Imagine a choice of Bernie, Hillary, Trump or  the Republican stooge (Ryan, Kasich, whomever).  I think Bernie would win going away.

Agree. We must be related. ;)

It&apos;s been suggested that if the establishment ends up stealing the nomination from Bernie he should consider being Dr. Jill Stein&apos;s running mate, giving the Green Party the national following it deserves. I have to say, although I&apos;d like to see Bernie win the nomination outright (and restore the Party of FDR), I find the possibility of a STEIN-SANDERS ticket awfully damn tantalizing. Imagine a GREEN revolution in the USA!

Stealing the nomination?  Since when did he have it?  He still might pull it out but I&apos;ll take the experience of Hillary fighting the Repubs the last 24 years over Bernie who just hit the national stage a few years ago.

When did Obama "hit the national stage"? Most voters never heard of him until he was running for the 2008 nomination.

Watch Bernie in 1992, 24 years ago, sounding very much like he does now, with all of that fire and conviction:

When did the4 Clinton fight Republicans, except as First Lady defending her husbands non-issue related controversies from the "Vast Right Wing conspiracy."
As I recall, the "New Democrat" Philosophy was to stop fighting Republicans and take what you can get by triangulations: The "Lesser of two evils" strategy on every issue.

The super delegate system makes the democrats seem more corrupt than the republicans- at least for the primary process.  I voted for BO twice, and made excuses for the drones and corporate shock doctrine stuff, etc., but "half (democratic party) a loaf is better than none" makes me allergic to the proverbial bread, whether it&apos;s half loaf or nothing.  I cannot eat it anymore. It makes me sick.  I need real "food" that doesn&apos;t make me nauseous, or I cannot eat.  If Bernie loses, Hillary does too.

All you Bernie fans are FANatics who wear blinders. The super delegate system has been in effect for decades. Hillary will pick a liberal SC justice--more liberal than O&apos;s pick

Just because it has existed for decades, doesn&apos;t make it right.  If they exist, as DWS said, to protect the Party Establishment from the grass roots (I can&apos;t believe she said that out loud) then the impact is obvious.  If they exist, as more carefully prepped Democrats say, to look out for the best interest of the party, then Sanders appeal at the convention should be heard with an open mind (and they should not have been making declarations before the campaigning even began).
This is no different from Trump, who will also go to his convention without enough delegates from votes to win on the first ballot, except that Clinton reportedly did the brokering in advance.  The Convention format assumes people will be listening to the candidates make their case in nominating speeches.  We can only hope there is integrity in the room when that happens, and that it is not all just fake show business for something that is already decided.

﻿ “You can’t occupy the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party will end by occupying you.”

Add this to the list of 1,000 reasons to say FU to HRC and the entire "Party".  The Party left its core principles under Bill Clinton.  Since then, it&apos;s been neoliberal/neocon Party, differentiating itself from Republicans ONLY on a couple of social issues, which matter little to the vast majority of us.  Meanwhile, Dem voters stupidly fell into the 40-year debate over abortion and LGBT issues, while our nation destroyed its democracy, largely through Clinton&apos;s deregulation of the media, and waged wars that have killed 4 million human beings, and shattered the lives of hundreds of millions.  While ALEC pushed its anti-climate, anti-labor, anti-education, anti-HUMAN agenda, the Dems sat around sipping wine.

The Dem Party put forward the biggest turd in US politics:  her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton.  She is distrusted and despised for a long list of very-real reasons.  

Let the new corporatist, Avenue K career politicians of the Party get their asses kicked in November.  They failed to return to the Party&apos;s roots with Sanders, while they had the best opportunity, and a long list of reasons.  They AGAIN turned their backs on The Humans of this country, and kissed the feet of their disgusting financiers, including the Israelis.  They ignored tens of millions of voices, and the most revolutionary campaign the US has seen in decades.  the stupidly forgot that the youth ARE the future of the Party, as the wealthy, comfy, unempathetic geezers supporting Clinton will soon by dying-off.

Apparently, nothing can inform them better than to be standing in November without support.

It has been a dirty filthy Machiavellian machine process from the start with Bernie.  It makes me physically ill to hear DDG talk about post mortems for Bernie, with the super delegates flying above like vulture, rendering  the West Coast votes  meaningless.  I think his schpiel is leading to "let us Democrats hold hands, sing Kumbaya, and give it up to Clinton."  That&apos;s what DDG really would like to say, but this patronizing "stay in the race" mumbo jumbo is the beginning of it.  I really don&apos; care who wins in November if it isn&apos;t Bernie.  I&apos;m (we are) not alone.  The revolution was not televised because the DLC gave the media a wink and nod.

West Coast votes (and others not yet given a chance to be heard) are far from meaningless!  Sanders could win, and either way, the largest possible number of delegates at the convention can trouble the monied party who will be more likely to pretend progressive in front of such an audience.  Machiaveli would have you have us rhetorically hold open the possibility of supporting Clinton until after the convention makes progressive concessions on platform, rules and leadership.
Then when she turns right. . .
Meanwhile, lets get on the down-ballot primaries in local jurisdictions, with a national effort, to get McGinty off the PA Senate ballot, replace DWS with Canova, and so forth. These things are happening now, and may be more important than the White House, or at least necessary to counter whichever not-progressive gets the White House if Bernie is edged out.

I see that the Democratic Convention is one week AFTER the Republican Convention this summer. This might be key to a Sanders nomination:
It&apos;s very possible that Kasich will end up with the Republican nomination after a couple of rounds. Why? He&apos;s the only one of the three remaining candidates who doesn&apos;t positively frighten the horses. The polls have shown that Trump and Cruz would be easily defeated by Clinton. Kasich, however, easily beats Clinton in those same polls. 
So the next week the Democratic Convention decides who&apos;s going to beat Kasich. It&apos;s not Hilary.  A certain cantankerous, old Brooklyn Jew might need to be drafted in the service of the Democratic Party. Keep going, Bernie. You&apos;re a hero to people all over the world.

That is one of several "External Forces" scenarios in which the Democratic Party may wake up and see Bernie favorably.  It is not insurgent or disrespectful for Bernie to fight hard to the convention, and make his best case just in case the "Superdelegates" and others sworn to look out for the Party&apos;s best interest may come to grips with the folly of the Clinton coronation.
Conventions have been carefully managed infomercials for so long that people forget the rules are there for a reason:
Nominate from the floor, give speeches, vote for the best interest of the party.  Asking Bernie to quit, or even let up, is contrary to the purpose of convention: to hear the voice of the people the party is supposed to represent (not the other way around).
To do anything other than fight hard for every vote and every issue all the way to the end would be wrong.

I think Kasich is the most reasonable one, Trump is seen as the "reformer"  by his supporters.  If trump starts talking like a gentleman, the R. party  memories of the thug-Trump will be short lived, and spun into oblivion.

Kasich is running as the reasonable one, the "Adult in the Room. A look at his record proves otherwise, but the other two were so awful around the time of the Ohio primary that any number of Democrats switched over to their home-boy Kasich just to try and derail Trump/Cruz.  I am even aware of Democrats in Vermont, assuming Bernie would carry the day without them or despite them, who took Republican ballots to do the same.
Kasich could play this image right thru November and take advantage of Hillary&apos;s high negatives.  He is a threat to Clinton, but not to Sanders.

Hardly, Kasich record is terrible.  At least the Donald has no record.  Sadly if Hillary gets the nomination, Kasich, could end up beating her as Hillary just does not generate the excitement that Bernie does.  A pity.  Hillary would be relatively good if she wasn&apos;t a Neocon.

Ah, well, I thought Bernie had already made it pretty clear what he stands for, or for whom he stands and why. 

I believe media to be his biggest obstacle. Big media clearly wants Big Clinton. Why? That&apos;s an easy one: Sensationalism (first woman president), big media&apos;s sole interest because it grabs viewers and that&apos;s good for advertisers, and when advertisers are getting the demos they want, media is making dough hand over fist. Why can&apos;t we just say what&apos;s going on? It&apos;s not complicated. It&apos;s power--doing what power does, rake it in because IT is so frightened of its enemy, the people.

Sadder even than big media is the American populace, whom are not deserving of being referred to as citizens. Citizens don&apos;t shirk their duty to themselves and to others. Citizens take the time and make the effort to find out what&apos;s up.

For what citizen does Hillary stand? Why is it not Hillary who needs to make clear a whole mess of things dating all the way back to her real estate (mis)dealings in Arkansas?

If citizens took the time and made the effort, they&apos;d discover that Sanders has most of them in mind and in plans he&apos;s made as clear as proverbial crystal.

Sanders sounds far more the populist than the socialist he is. He has to, so frightened are Americans STILL of the s-word. Sanders can still win this thing, and those of us who are backing him will just have to hope that there are still some citizens to be discovered outside of pitiful New York City and state.

The media doesn&apos;t care that she&apos;d be the first woman president.  They don&apos;t want to lose MONEY in advertising and investments.  Did you ever count the number of drug ads on MSNBC or CNN over an hour?  And CBS made hay while Trump was shining in spite of the fact that "it was bad for the country."  Once he started winning, they all got nervous.
And have some compassion for the voters.  Remember, many are working two jobs, maybe both parents working, raising kids, driving them to and from sports, after school activities, shopping, cooking, packing lunches.  People are busy and then they turn on the nightly news.  Are you kidding?  I thought you had it when you berated the media but then you blame the voters.   They are being lied to on the news, shut out of the voting process even if they can find an open polling place, forced to jump through like-fighting-city-hall registration hoops, and being fed confusing delegate counts which include superdelegates.  The march in NY last Saturday for Bernie reminded me of the huge marches in NY and London before the invasion of Iraq.  Power always gets what it wants.  Unless it doesn&apos;t.  The DNC thinks they&apos;ve got this.  Wrong again.

DREAM ON

please, start calling her "Clinton"

Please, start calling her "Clinton."

Hillary can be bought.  The MSM knows it.  To low information voters, she a devil, but the devil they know, and the MSM, don&apos;t want them to know anyone else.  The small-d  democratic process has been corrupted to the point of being a throwback to the days of white male landowners deciding who to put in power, only the are not all white and male, and they own much more than land.

Sanders all the way to the convention.

Guttenplan writes, "We need to ask ourselves why a movement candidate in a movement moment still fell short..." 

Only you refuse to do anything but imply that Sanders and his supporters, somehow, failed (and that he now now needs to LISTEN -- "heel! heel! heel!").

Only we won&apos;t ever get real answers about how the movement was quashed, because The Nation and other mainstream "journalists" refuse to investigate the MASSIVE voter suppression, registration-flipping, vote-flipping, and poll-closing FRAUD that has defined this primary.

(Please, Nation editors, don&apos;t just PRETEND to endorse Bernie and our movement, like 1990s-present Democrats PRETEND to battle the forces of the far-right: STAND FOR SOMETHING.)
