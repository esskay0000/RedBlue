Former Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio said Tuesday that he plans to support Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee, even as he distanced himself from the business mogul and said he is not interested in being his vice presidential running mate.

Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper in his first national television interview since ending his campaign in March, the Florida senator seemed determined to walk a fine line when it comes to the presumptive GOP nominee. He repeatedly vowed to support the "the Republican nominee," rather than using Trump's name. He said he does not intend to spend the next six months criticizing Trump. But rather than devote himself to boosting Trump directly, Rubio said he plans to focus his energy on down-ballot Republicans.

As for speculation that he could be Trump's running mate, Rubio said flatly that he is not interested.

"I believe that he would be best served by someone who more fully embraces the things he stands for. And that's certainly not me," said Rubio.

Rubio said he hasn't even decided if he is going to attend the July Republican National Convention. "I'm open to going," he said, without committing.

During the final weeks of his campaign, Rubio lobbed intense personal and policy criticisms at Trump, including labeling him a "con artist." Trump referred to Rubio as "Little Marco."

"My differences with Donald, both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him are well-documented and they remain," Rubio said Tuesday.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) said last week that he was not ready to support Trump. Rubio said he is not taking the same position as Ryan, citing a promise he made during the campaign to support the eventual nominee.

"I signed a pledged saying I'd support the Republican nominee and I intend to continue do that," said Rubio.

The senator said that despite their differences, he does not plan to be "taking shots" Trump or become as his "chief critic" in the run-up to the November election. But Rubio signaled that his presence on the campaign trail will mostly be keyed to down-ballot contests.

"I think one of the best ways that I can be supportive of the conservative cause is to go out there and work on behalf of those who, for example, are running to hold the Republican majority in the United States Senate or candidates across the country that share my views on national security, on some of these other issues," said Rubio.

Asked how he reconciled his stiff opposition to Trump with his decision to support him, Rubio said that voters "went out and voted" for Trump.

Rubio also weighed in on his relationship with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who ended his campaign last week. Rubio swatted down speculation that Cruz had directly courted him to be his running mate.

  [Ted Cruz built a brand on being the most hated man in Washington. Now what?]  

"I talked to Ted the day after the Florida primary when I dropped out, he didn't say a word about VP or anything of that nature," Rubio said. He added that stories about the idea were "largely inaccurate" and "unfortunate" because they implied that Cruz's running mate Carly Fiorina was not the Texan's first choice.

Rubio didn't shed new light on what his post-Senate career might hold. He said he does not plan to become a lobbyist or run for governor. He left the door open to running for president again.

"I'm open to a future in public service," he said.
