Last week was the harshest so far, by far, in the presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. It was childishly harsh, with the “she did it first” back and forth over who said who wasn’t “qualified.” But was it harsh enough to hurt the party’s chances to unite in November against the Republicans?

I don’t know the answer to that, for sure, but let’s remember: this is nothing compared to 2008. As if to remind us, Monday marks the eighth anniversary of the discovery of remarks by then-Senator Obama, made to a roomful of wealthy San Francisco supporters, about white, working-class voters in Pennsylvania. It was supposed to doom his candidacy—not just according to the GOP, but to other Democrats, and not just Democrats on Clinton’s team.		
On the eve of the supposedly crucial Pennsylvania primary—Clinton won it 55-45, and went on to take most of the big closing 2008 primaries—Obama had this to say:		
You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing’s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush Administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate, and they have not. And it’s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.		
Recorded secretly by a Huffington Post “citizen-journalist,” Obama’s remarks—and the reaction to them—dominated several news cycles. Clinton was already winning working-class whites in states like Ohio and Texas; this incident provided an ex post facto rationale that didn’t involve his race, but rather his supposed “elitism.” At the time, I argued that Obama’s remarks, in context, were actually sympathetic to the working-class whites he was describing. But it was clear right away that the flap was going to hurt Obama, at least for a while.		
“This is a perfect example of why Democrats lose elections,” John Edwards backer David “Mudcat” Saunders told The New York Times (his man had left the race months earlier). “It could mean he’s rendered himself unelectable.”		
While Clinton’s current supporters have warned Sanders not to take hard shots at the party’s likely nominee, given that the Vermont socialist has a near-impossible task to catch her in delegates, they ought to recall their candidate’s response to Obama’s unfortunate comments back in 2008.		
“I was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small-town America,” Clinton told reporters as the story exploded. “His remarks are elitist and out of touch.” In Indianapolis, campaigning ahead of the state’s May primary, she laid it on even thicker: “I grew up in a church-going family, a family that believed in the importance of living out and expressing our faith,” she said at a rally in Indianapolis. “The people of faith I know don’t ‘cling to’ religion because they’re bitter. People embrace faith not because they are materially poor, but because they are spiritually rich.” In North Carolina, Clinton campaigners distributed stickers reading: “I’m not bitter.”

Card-carrying Democratic Leadership Council Senator Evan Bayh even used Obama’s comments to make the case to super delegates that Obama wouldn’t be able to defeat Senator John McCain in November. “They’re going to say that we’re weak on national security,” Bayh said, “that we’re a bunch of high taxers and spenders, and out here in the middle of the country we don’t understand people’s values. The question is, have we given them some hook they can hang their hat on to make that argument?” The New York Times reported at the time that Barack Obama was furiously working the phones, trying to reassure superdelegates that he hadn’t destroyed his candidacy.		
“People in rural Pennsylvania don’t turn to guns and religion as an escape,” Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, an ever-loyal Clinton supporter, piled on. “Hunting and sportsmanship are long-established traditions here, and people of faith founded the commonwealth and continue to live here. What the senator has done is essentially misread what is actually happening in Pennsylvania.” Rendell suggested Obama had mortally wounded himself in his state.		
Clinton did win the primary—but Obama won Pennsylvania that November with 54.7 percent of the vote, almost four points more than John Kerry in 2004.		
The bitter exchanges didn’t even end there, in mid-April. Clinton had yet to make the unfortunate, racially loaded appeal that Obama wasn’t connecting with “hard-working Americans, white Americans”—and that she was. The Obama team hadn’t yet scorched Clinton by charging she had intentionally played on fears of Obama’s assassination, when she argued for her continued candidacy by noting that other Democratic contests had continued through June, and referenced Bobby Kennedy’s murder that month in 1968. And of course, at this point, Clinton had already endured two months of pundits’ demanding that she get out of the race; in May, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann would famously suggest that a superdelegate ought to “take her into a room, and only he comes out”—figuratively, of course—in order to stop her candidacy.		
I remind us of this bitter history not to say “Bombs away, Bernie and Hillary!” or to argue that the 2016 race shouldn’t stick to the issues. I just think it’s worth noting that these contests get hotter as the race goes on, and both sides become less adroit about highlighting legitimate political differences without insults—and yet, the party still came together that November. The 2008 Clinton team was in the same position as the 2016 Sanders team is now: Her campaign picked up momentum late, but having lost crucial early primaries (and in her case that year, caucuses), she couldn’t close the delegate gap with Obama. (In 2016 terms, she had to #feelthemath.) Like Sanders supporters this year, angry that the deadline to change your registration to “Democrat” in New York was in October, or that Wyoming’s caucus absentee-ballot rules let Clinton keep pace there, 2008 Clinton backers complained that the primary rules were rigged against her—particularly because Michigan and Florida, which were strong Clinton states, didn’t count that year, because they had defied the Democratic National Committee and scheduled early primaries. As a Clinton supporter, I remember thinking for a while that it was crazy to ignore results from those states. But in fact, it wasn’t crazy but fair, and Clinton had signed on to run for the nomination under those rules.		
Still, the New York senator suspended her campaign only after the last primary in June that year. She dropped her bid to win over superdelegates—she trailed Obama in pledged delegates by 100, but essentially tied him in the popular vote, and he needed superdelegates to get him over the threshold for the nomination. But there was even a little drama at the Denver convention in August: Team Obama wanted him nominated by acclamation; some of Team Clinton wanted a roll-call vote, to reflect her “18 million cracks” in the glass ceiling of presidential politics. In a compromise, Clinton herself, standing with the New York delegation she’d won, nominated Obama by acclamation. We know how the story ends: The man Clinton once argued was a doomed candidate won two terms as president.		
There are two reasons to worry that unity might not be as easy in 2016, even if the actual nominating contest is less bitter this year (so far). One is that Sanders is bringing many voters into the process who aren’t Democrats, and have no interest in preserving the party or fighting a united front in November. Another is that there is an ideological gulf between the candidates that didn’t exist in 2008. Clinton wasn’t angling to push Obama left or right, or to alter the Democratic platform, as Sanders certainly (and rightfully) will if he is not the nominee.		
So we can’t take for granted a repeat of the post-primary unity we saw after a nasty contest in 2008. Still, let’s not pretend that, by this time eight years ago, Obama had the luxury of merely thinking about who to choose as a running mate and how to win big swing states like Ohio and Florida. He didn’t. Sanders and Clinton took steps toward reducing last week’s tension by telling reporters this weekend that of course they will support their opponent in November, if their campaigns fall short. That’s probably the best Democrats can hope for at a moment like this.

While Clinton’s current supporters have warned Sanders not to take hard shots at the party’s likely nominee, given that the Vermont socialist has a near-impossible task to catch her in delegates, they ought to recall their candidate’s response to Obama’s unfortunate comments back in 2008.		
“I was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small-town America,” Clinton told reporters as the story exploded. “His remarks are elitist and out of touch.” In Indianapolis, campaigning ahead of the state’s May primary, she laid it on even thicker: “I grew up in a church-going family, a family that believed in the importance of living out and expressing our faith,” she said at a rally in Indianapolis. “The people of faith I know don’t ‘cling to’ religion because they’re bitter. People embrace faith not because they are materially poor, but because they are spiritually rich.” In North Carolina, Clinton campaigners distributed stickers reading: “I’m not bitter.”

Card-carrying Democratic Leadership Council Senator Evan Bayh even used Obama’s comments to make the case to super delegates that Obama wouldn’t be able to defeat Senator John McCain in November. “They’re going to say that we’re weak on national security,” Bayh said, “that we’re a bunch of high taxers and spenders, and out here in the middle of the country we don’t understand people’s values. The question is, have we given them some hook they can hang their hat on to make that argument?” The New York Times reported at the time that Barack Obama was furiously working the phones, trying to reassure superdelegates that he hadn’t destroyed his candidacy.		
“People in rural Pennsylvania don’t turn to guns and religion as an escape,” Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, an ever-loyal Clinton supporter, piled on. “Hunting and sportsmanship are long-established traditions here, and people of faith founded the commonwealth and continue to live here. What the senator has done is essentially misread what is actually happening in Pennsylvania.” Rendell suggested Obama had mortally wounded himself in his state.		
Clinton did win the primary—but Obama won Pennsylvania that November with 54.7 percent of the vote, almost four points more than John Kerry in 2004.		
The bitter exchanges didn’t even end there, in mid-April. Clinton had yet to make the unfortunate, racially loaded appeal that Obama wasn’t connecting with “hard-working Americans, white Americans”—and that she was. The Obama team hadn’t yet scorched Clinton by charging she had intentionally played on fears of Obama’s assassination, when she argued for her continued candidacy by noting that other Democratic contests had continued through June, and referenced Bobby Kennedy’s murder that month in 1968. And of course, at this point, Clinton had already endured two months of pundits’ demanding that she get out of the race; in May, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann would famously suggest that a superdelegate ought to “take her into a room, and only he comes out”—figuratively, of course—in order to stop her candidacy.		
I remind us of this bitter history not to say “Bombs away, Bernie and Hillary!” or to argue that the 2016 race shouldn’t stick to the issues. I just think it’s worth noting that these contests get hotter as the race goes on, and both sides become less adroit about highlighting legitimate political differences without insults—and yet, the party still came together that November. The 2008 Clinton team was in the same position as the 2016 Sanders team is now: Her campaign picked up momentum late, but having lost crucial early primaries (and in her case that year, caucuses), she couldn’t close the delegate gap with Obama. (In 2016 terms, she had to #feelthemath.) Like Sanders supporters this year, angry that the deadline to change your registration to “Democrat” in New York was in October, or that Wyoming’s caucus absentee-ballot rules let Clinton keep pace there, 2008 Clinton backers complained that the primary rules were rigged against her—particularly because Michigan and Florida, which were strong Clinton states, didn’t count that year, because they had defied the Democratic National Committee and scheduled early primaries. As a Clinton supporter, I remember thinking for a while that it was crazy to ignore results from those states. But in fact, it wasn’t crazy but fair, and Clinton had signed on to run for the nomination under those rules.		
Still, the New York senator suspended her campaign only after the last primary in June that year. She dropped her bid to win over superdelegates—she trailed Obama in pledged delegates by 100, but essentially tied him in the popular vote, and he needed superdelegates to get him over the threshold for the nomination. But there was even a little drama at the Denver convention in August: Team Obama wanted him nominated by acclamation; some of Team Clinton wanted a roll-call vote, to reflect her “18 million cracks” in the glass ceiling of presidential politics. In a compromise, Clinton herself, standing with the New York delegation she’d won, nominated Obama by acclamation. We know how the story ends: The man Clinton once argued was a doomed candidate won two terms as president.		
There are two reasons to worry that unity might not be as easy in 2016, even if the actual nominating contest is less bitter this year (so far). One is that Sanders is bringing many voters into the process who aren’t Democrats, and have no interest in preserving the party or fighting a united front in November. Another is that there is an ideological gulf between the candidates that didn’t exist in 2008. Clinton wasn’t angling to push Obama left or right, or to alter the Democratic platform, as Sanders certainly (and rightfully) will if he is not the nominee.		
So we can’t take for granted a repeat of the post-primary unity we saw after a nasty contest in 2008. Still, let’s not pretend that, by this time eight years ago, Obama had the luxury of merely thinking about who to choose as a running mate and how to win big swing states like Ohio and Florida. He didn’t. Sanders and Clinton took steps toward reducing last week’s tension by telling reporters this weekend that of course they will support their opponent in November, if their campaigns fall short. That’s probably the best Democrats can hope for at a moment like this.

That’s probably the best Democrats can hope for at a moment like this.		
		

The bitter exchanges didn’t even end there, in mid-April. Clinton had yet to make the unfortunate, racially loaded appeal that Obama wasn’t connecting with “hard-working Americans, white Americans”—and that she was. The Obama team hadn’t yet scorched Clinton by charging she had intentionally played on fears of Obama’s assassination, when she argued for her continued candidacy by noting that other Democratic contests had continued through June, and referenced Bobby Kennedy’s murder that month in 1968. And of course, at this point, Clinton had already endured two months of pundits’ demanding that she get out of the race; in May, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann would famously suggest that a superdelegate ought to “take her into a room, and only he comes out”—figuratively, of course—in order to stop her candidacy.		
I remind us of this bitter history not to say “Bombs away, Bernie and Hillary!” or to argue that the 2016 race shouldn’t stick to the issues. I just think it’s worth noting that these contests get hotter as the race goes on, and both sides become less adroit about highlighting legitimate political differences without insults—and yet, the party still came together that November. The 2008 Clinton team was in the same position as the 2016 Sanders team is now: Her campaign picked up momentum late, but having lost crucial early primaries (and in her case that year, caucuses), she couldn’t close the delegate gap with Obama. (In 2016 terms, she had to #feelthemath.) Like Sanders supporters this year, angry that the deadline to change your registration to “Democrat” in New York was in October, or that Wyoming’s caucus absentee-ballot rules let Clinton keep pace there, 2008 Clinton backers complained that the primary rules were rigged against her—particularly because Michigan and Florida, which were strong Clinton states, didn’t count that year, because they had defied the Democratic National Committee and scheduled early primaries. As a Clinton supporter, I remember thinking for a while that it was crazy to ignore results from those states. But in fact, it wasn’t crazy but fair, and Clinton had signed on to run for the nomination under those rules.		
Still, the New York senator suspended her campaign only after the last primary in June that year. She dropped her bid to win over superdelegates—she trailed Obama in pledged delegates by 100, but essentially tied him in the popular vote, and he needed superdelegates to get him over the threshold for the nomination. But there was even a little drama at the Denver convention in August: Team Obama wanted him nominated by acclamation; some of Team Clinton wanted a roll-call vote, to reflect her “18 million cracks” in the glass ceiling of presidential politics. In a compromise, Clinton herself, standing with the New York delegation she’d won, nominated Obama by acclamation. We know how the story ends: The man Clinton once argued was a doomed candidate won two terms as president.		
There are two reasons to worry that unity might not be as easy in 2016, even if the actual nominating contest is less bitter this year (so far). One is that Sanders is bringing many voters into the process who aren’t Democrats, and have no interest in preserving the party or fighting a united front in November. Another is that there is an ideological gulf between the candidates that didn’t exist in 2008. Clinton wasn’t angling to push Obama left or right, or to alter the Democratic platform, as Sanders certainly (and rightfully) will if he is not the nominee.		
So we can’t take for granted a repeat of the post-primary unity we saw after a nasty contest in 2008. Still, let’s not pretend that, by this time eight years ago, Obama had the luxury of merely thinking about who to choose as a running mate and how to win big swing states like Ohio and Florida. He didn’t. Sanders and Clinton took steps toward reducing last week’s tension by telling reporters this weekend that of course they will support their opponent in November, if their campaigns fall short. That’s probably the best Democrats can hope for at a moment like this.

In the last week or so, we&apos;ve witnessed Hillary making a joke about Ghandi, from India, running a gas station in Missouri, and laughing and wink winking at a joke about Colored People Time.  We&apos;ve seen Bill lecturing and yelling at Black Lives Matter protesters, basic calling them stupid.  Is it safe to say there&apos;s a pattern developing here?

Thank you, Ms Walsh, for reminding us that Hillary Clinton&apos;s nastiness is not just a recent phenomenon, but has been a part of at least her public persona for quite some time. That same nastiness seems to manifest itself in the conduct of her supporters. I am not referring to you, Ms Walsh; you have been quite civil in your statements. But the degree of rancor exhibited by Mrs. Clinton&apos;s supporters has been very disturbing; the animus of her defenders is far greater than anything I have witnessed so far on the part of Mr. Sanders&apos; supporters.

Perhaps the most infuriating reasons we have to worry about the real possibility of voters deserting the Democratic Party are the obvious up-front rigging of the game for Hillary, the nightly distortions and lies coming from Hillary&apos;s surrogates, and the corporate media&apos;s collusion in that. And you have been an ardent and vocal participant. If you&apos;re so worried about where Bernie&apos;s voters are going to go, you&apos;d better get real fair, real quick.

Why is this Clinton shill still on the payroll?

The issue for November is NOT whether Democratic Party can unite. Rather, it&apos;s whether the Democratic Party fails the American people by nominating such a duplicitous and obviously plutocratic candidate as Clinton.

She has NOTHING she can give to the American people. Putting her on the November ballot only kicks the can down the road. The sickness in Washington can only begin to be addressed by electing Bernie.

Do like Brene Brown preaches: Dare greatly. 

Hillary is the antithesis of daring greatly when it comes to her political positions and platform.

Sure, she has dared greatly to run for president. But she&apos;s telling YOU that the real candidate to represent the need for the PEOPLE to dare greatly is aiming too high.

Thank you, Ms. Walsh, for one of the more readable non-partisan articles at this stage of the Democratic primary. I found your piece thoughtful and informative. That said, so far as our rather dismal hopes for "party unity" if Sec. Clinton prevails at the end of this mess, your assessment overlooks a rather large feature of this process, lacking in the 2008 contest. And that omission has to do with the DNC, DWS, the Clintons themselves (Bill in Massachusetts, breaking the law), the pro-Hillary Iowa Democratic Party chair, Harry Reid, and various other establishment forces CAUGHT CHEATING in an effort to steal the nomination for Hillary Clinton.

I am from Arizona, raised in Maricopa County, and I can tell you: the 2016 Democratic Primary is playing out like Florida 2000 in slow motion (from over 400 polling places in 2008 to 60 in 2016 in my home county -- for over 800,000 voters!). Here’s a glimpse into what it was like to try to navigate through Arizona’s gargantuan exercise in voter suppression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeNx7iBX_i4

And the personal anecdotes that emerged in this hearing are awfully compelling, I think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2togSItA77E

Across the map (IA, NV, MA, MO, IL, NC, AZ...), we are seeing ridiculously long lines, flipped registrations and uncounted provisional ballots TAINTING this process. Wyoming’s unusually high number of “surrogate” ballots (absent from the caucus, yet counted), breaking hard for HRC, also seems to be raising valid questions.

IOW, it’s been a cluster(mess) of a primary, thus far, not including the Bernie media blackout and other establishment thumbs on the scale; it’s been a disaster of our election mechanisms, marked by considerable voter disenfranchisement and the flipping of outcomes! International monitors would probably declare the need for a redo -- but no American government would permit such scrutiny or transparency in our elections.

Bottom line: If the wave that we Bernie boosters are building isn&apos;t sufficient to overcome this rigged and corrupted process, there is no way in hell that I&apos;ll be voting for Dick Cheney in a pantsuit (hey, he&apos;s cool with Kissinger and marriage equality, too!). Please focus your colleagues on exposing the multitude of ways that the establishment is trying to STEAL this election from the 99%.

Both journalism and democracy demand it.

Funny, in this whole thing with the Democrats the character whose actual behavior and substantive policies tend toward elitism is Hillary Clinton.  I&apos;m consistently disappointed at what looks to be millions of middle class women who choose to look the other way.  Hillary may help some with gender issues, but something tells me not as much as a lot of women may think she will.  When I found out last year more of her background (that she cannot talk about now) it all made sense;  She is NOT a "liberal feminist."  People are making her out to be much more liberal than she is,  most know that by now.  By a large, she is MUCH more conservative than say an ex-military guy like McGovern.  I would be really surprised to see her make the gains just on women&apos;s issues people think she will.  Because of her somewhat hypocritical mindset coming out the gate, I cannot help but say "yuk."

I won&apos;t vote for Hillary, but then I&apos;m not a Democrat and haven&apos;t been for decades. As the Democrats lost their traditional values and veered centerwise, mainly under Bill Clinton, I began to search for other ways to express my disdain. Living in Vermont, it was easy as we have a Progressive party. While I have held my nose and voted for Democratic presidents in the past, I see no reason to do it this year if my senator is not the nominee. He is speaking truth about income inequality and the role of the Wall Street banks in the crash of 2008. Hillary is not. He is talking of a moral economy at the Vatican later this week. How on earth can I hold my nose and vote for Hillary? I will write in Bernie&apos;s name, and keep my fingers crossed.

So, we&apos;ll all get back together as if we were never apart? Doubt it. The Democratic party leadership is out of touch with too many constituents (like "people under 40"), who see much of this primary and politics in general as a rigged system, one in which they are not meant to play a serious role. Until the Democratic party revisits its platform on climate change, stopping the unending US military engagement in the Middle East, providing health care and college tuition as a right of citizenship and getting big money out of politics, it is highly unlikely that Bernie&apos;s revolutionaries are going to willingly return to being Stepford wives.

In addition to visiting the Vatican, on his way back from Rome, Bernie could stop off at Lourdes. Now that would be real hardball.

And pick up a plastic bottle of holy water in the shape of the Virgin? Lourdes didn&apos;t feel like a holy place. On the other hand, I got a spiritual wow at Fatima in the mist with no one around.

Funny you should say that because my uncle, who was a Redemptorist priest, also disliked Lourdes, claiming you could see “greed for money” in the eyes of the people. Presumably he meant the street vendors or others in the tourist service industry. We visited the shrine ourselves en famille just once, but it was a blazing hot day and that overwhelmed any other impressions, certainly any impression of holiness. Since then we’ve just driven past the town on the way to Gavarnie or Cauterets. It’s interesting that of the ten Marian apparition sites recognized by the Vatican, five are in France, two are in French speaking areas of Belgium (one right on the French border), two more in Latin countries (Portugal and Mexico), with the last of them being in Ireland (a Latin people trapped in a Northern climate). What’s the big attraction for Mary in France? Maybe there’s something to the DaVinci Code after all… Anyway, Bernie will need a miracle at this stage, seeing as how closely Clinton Inc studied Obama’s 08 playbook. But when you see what he’s achieved – well, Hillary was damn lucky Elizabeth Warren didn’t go for it.

First. Check your calendar. It&apos;s not 2008. You seem to be stuck there. Secondly you&apos;re reverting to your recent Chris (Roy Cohn Jr.) Mathhews red baiting days..leving out the word "democratic" before the word socialist. Ho convenient. Secondly if Hillary should get the nomination and lose to Trump, It will be Hillary Clinton and only Hillary Clinton who loses the election. No one is required to close  her mammoth unlike ability gap.  It&apos;s her problem.

Apparently this is a new Clinton campaign strategy, and we should expect to start hearing/reading the word "socialist" more often from Clinton supporters.It started with Representative Hakeem Jeffries of NY, who released a statement last Thursday calling Senator Sanders a “gun-loving socialist with zero foreign policy experience." Now the label appears in Joan Walsh&apos;s column. 
The only way for Clinton to "disqualify and defeat" Sanders is through distortion of his record and by associating him with extremism.  The problem they face is that his progressive record is stellar, so they latch onto the one facet of his gun control record that they consider imperfect, and inflate it into a huge issue. Last week, Hillary stooped so low as to tweet: "@BernieSanders prioritized gun manufacturers&apos; rights over the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook."
By the way, Bernie has a D minus rating from the NRA, and where I went to school that was no better than an F.

Politifact rates Bernie&apos;s claim for a D- with the NRA as mostly true. In years past he&apos;s had a C and some Fs. This tells the story of Bernie and the NRA grading system.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/20/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-nra-report-card-d-minus-most-recent/

Oh, and Bernie says he is a Democratic socialist.  This submission from Wikipedia explains what exactly that is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism

Why anyone would down vote a comment mentioning facts is anyone&apos;s guess. Just read the link for your own edification sheeple!

Perhaps it is because you are restating the obvious. The issue with the "socialism" label is that the Clinton camp is intentionally leaving out the proper adjective "Democratic" because socialism unto itself sounds much more extreme, and usually includes a government takeover of a society&apos;s means of production. Bernie is so clearly in favor of strengthening  our social safety net and ensuring that the least among us do not fall through the proverbial cracks. He is a new dealer-style, FDR Democrat.
