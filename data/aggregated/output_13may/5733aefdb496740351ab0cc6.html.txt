FBI head says he's unfamiliar with 'security inquiry' term


The Clinton Campaign











         WASHINGTON        (AP) -- FBI Director James Comey said Wednesday that he was unfamiliar with the "security inquiry" terminology the Clinton campaign sometimes uses to discuss an ongoing investigation arising from Hillary Clinton&apos;s use of a private email server as secretary of state. He also reiterated that there was no set timeline to wrap up the investigation and that he was committed to it being done well.

Comey was asked at a round-table discussion with reporters about whether the agency was indeed doing a "security inquiry." That is a term, along with "security review," that Clinton and her aides have used in interviews and statements to characterize the nature of the investigation.

"I don&apos;t know what that means," Comey said when asked about the "security inquiry" language.

He added, "We&apos;re conducting an investigation. That&apos;s the Bureau&apos;s business, that&apos;s what we do. That&apos;s probably all I can say about it."

Comey declined to offer specifics about the investigation, including when it might conclude, though he said he was not "tethered" to any external deadline - such as the Democratic National Convention this summer - to complete it.

"I remain close to that investigation to ensure that it&apos;s done well and has the resources that are needed," Comey said. "My goal in any investigation is to do it well and to do it promptly, especially investigations of intense public interest."
