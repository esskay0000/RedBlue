It’s that time of year again. Prospective law students around the country must choose which school they will attend. They will compare costs, job prospects, location, and other deciding factors. But, for the first time, students looking at public law schools in Texas must compare a new factor: their safety on campus in light of Senate Bill 11, permitting concealed handguns on public college campuses.		
Not long ago, I was one of those prospective students. My law school strategy was simple: cast a wide net and hope something sticks. I applied to a handful of schools, including the University of Texas Law School. My relationship with UT-Austin runs deep. During my time as an undergrad on the Forty Acres, the school gave me a number of opportunities I never imagined possible growing up in rural East Texas. Besides my emotional connection, Texas Law also appealed to me because in the face of rising law school tuition across the nation, it remains a great value compared to private schools.		
In an exercise of naïve optimism, I thought SB 11 would not pass, or that the administration might circumvent it, and the issue of concealed carrying would not factor in my decision-making. I was wrong.		
The inscription on the UT Tower celebrates the freedom to learn in universities. It reads, “Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.” The UT Tower is a symbol of learning, freedom of expression, and intellectual discovery. It is also the site of the 1966 Charles Whitman shootings, which left 15 people dead and 32 wounded. Now, campus carry stands to threaten these values, putting students’ minds and bodies at risk, and with them, the future success of UT-Austin.		
I have experienced two school shootings in my life: once in middle school when gunfire broke out at the neighboring high school, and once as a freshman at UT-Austin when an unstable student shot at random on campus before taking his own life. I would never wish these harrowing experiences on anyone. Unfortunately, state governments around the country are considering bills similar to SB 11. Other states considering this legislation should look to Texas, and see the fear and frustration facing students and faculty, even before the law has gone into effect.

As an undergraduate, I had many diverse and at times provocative perspectives shape my learning. I learned most by listening to viewpoints different from my own. This freedom of expression makes universities ideal for the safe exchange of ideas. Campus carry corrupts this marketplace and threatens to undermine its very integrity. How can professors teach courses or assign grades with the possibility of violent retaliation one pull of a trigger away? How can students engage one another if the fear of offense is now informed by the fear of safety? Come August 1, the concept of trigger warnings will take on a literal meaning in Texas college campuses.		
These concerns heighten when considering graduate and professional programs, particularly the law school.		
Two major concerns inform my opposition to campus carry at the law school. The first, numbers. Only students 21 and older will be able to obtain a concealed-handgun license, a fact proponents of the bill love to cite. While these older students make up only a small fraction of undergraduate programs, they make up the majority of the law school. Realizing most of my classmates could potentially be carrying lethal weapons would increase my fear of speaking freely.		
These numbers apply to all graduate programs, but my second concern pertains to the environment of law school specifically. Students must grapple with the stress of grades and careers, but also with topics like abortion and marriage equality, adding fuel to the fire. The potential for offense in legal classrooms is high, and adding guns in the mix is dangerous.		
SB 11 was only one reason I turned down Texas Law, but it was an important one. Over the past months, UT has felt the impact of campus carry as prominent faculty members have left the school and other recruits have turned it down, citing the new law as a factor. From personal conversations, I know other admitted students express concern over the law, and I imagine the legislation will continue to pose problems as the university tries to recruit exceptional students and faculty.		
SB 11 threatens the future of higher education in Texas. As a Longhorn and a Texan, this possibility frightens me, and I hope it does you, too.

I really enjoy the "Responsible Gun Owner" meme. I&apos;ve met plenty of gun owners and maybe a couple who I&apos;d call responsible. One incident that comes to mind is a group of people getting drunk and playing with guns. They decided that it was best to put away the guns cause people were getting sloppy, so they took out the pellet guns. Later on they were explaining to a police officer at the hospital how one of the guys got a pellet lodged in his shoulder.  Or what about the Hero Wannabies who take guns to the theater just in case there is a shooting, as if firing a gun into a panicked crowd running through a dark room is going to do anything but increase the body count. I&apos;ve had moron friends waving guns around when talking and saw the muzzle aimed at almost everyone in the room at least once. Firearm safety isn&apos;t difficult but it takes something that is in short supply nowadays, Self Awareness.

It seems to me that those who are most fearful, distrusting and unlikely to mix with people different than themselves feel the need to have guns. They seem to view the world as a place to be feared and that everyone wants what they have. 

I believe guns to be one of the worst inventions man has made (along with the leaf blower!). It makes it too clean and easy to kill. You can do it at a distance and not even see the mess you&apos;ve made. Knives and swords take skill and close proximity plus the numbers are kept down by physical exhaustion.  Once guns mechanized killing, it is done impersonally, with little skill and in large numbers. Slaughter.

Mankind is losing the ability to talk and to negotiate. The guns come out and those "quickest with the biggest" lead the onslot. Today it&apos;s in the middle of cities with innocent women and children likely to become the victims.  What honor is there in killing? As George Hoffman says killing changes one forever. You still have to live with what you&apos;ve done weeks, months and years later.

There is only one driver behind privatization of public services and that is PROFIT. Capitalists are drooling at the prospect of running schools as a business as they get payment up front and do not have to produce results as shown by Phoenix University and the charter schools. These business people love prisons where again they get paid regardless of the results and are guaranteed as with schools a steady influx of new customers. As someone who worked for Fortune 100 companies for decades in the retail, industrial, and high tech sectors I know that American businessmen are no smarter and no more capable than those in the public sector and instead we see the Peter Principle in effect where people rise to their level of incompetence and sometime as with the military it is because of their incompetence. Whether it is a general or a Fiorina we have thousands of casualties from bad judgement and yet the decision makers get promoted and their golden parachutes and pensions. The great prevailing myth is that businesses are more efficient and better run but if that was true they would not need to depend on monopolies as with Microsoft and AT&T or on military spending or on taxpayer bailouts as with all the major banks and Wall Street firms.

At least UT still has the Plan II program.
I graduated from Texas Law School in 1961 and now live out-of-State.  From 1961-1963 I was an Assistant District Attorney of Dallas County; my major caseload was felony gun cases -- I was there when Kennedy was shot -- in fact, I was the chief prosecutor in the court where later Jack Ruby was convicted for killing Lee Harvey Oswald -- On November 22, 1963, Dallas was the homicide capital of the U.S. among metropolitan areas. 
Reading about the gun madness gripping Texas now, I am stunned -- how can anyone be so stupid as to favor such a law? (Although having briefly worked as an assistant calendar clerk for the Texas House of Representatives while in Texas Law School, I never ceased to wonder how any progressive legislation ever got passed.) Is there a collective mania at work? 
There should be a survey of how many persons who have served in the military over the past 50 years have been involved in Texas in homicides with a gun of what ever type -- I bet the percentage is incredibly low, almost minuscule. In other words, those who served in the military as I did (in the Marine Reserves), developed a healthy respect for firearms, knew the lethality of those weapons and knew the place for guns was not in the hands of civilians. 
Perhaps someone or some group should try to find out whether there is any connection between NRA membership, donors and supporters and organized crime -- who else benefits from this madness?
Were I now faced with the same choice, I also would probably go elsewhere to law school and elsewhere for undergraduate studies as well.

When everyone has a weapon and carries it openly; when all abortions are banned, everywhere;  when all immigrants have been deported and all borders closed; when gays are forbidden to marry; when trans-sexuals have to use "biologically appropriate" restrooms or face jail time; when all businesses everywhere can again refuse to serve people because of their skin color; when states once more support schools segregated by race; when the nation is engaged in three or four hot wars because the President didn&apos;t like the tone of some foreign leader&apos;s comment; when the rich aren&apos;t taxed at all, ever; and when corporate lobbyists openly buy and sell favors on the floor of the House; and when the Pentagon consumes 90% of the federal budget to "keep us strong"--what outrageous new law or practice will Republicans then offer their restless "base" in order to secure their loyalty in the next election?

I served as a medical corpsman in Vietnam, and after all the horrific things I saw, I want absolutely nothing to do with owning a weapon. If these advocates were forced to take care of gunshot victims or at least visit the ward at a local hospital as part of the licensing process to obtain a firearm or a rifle, I think it would make them realize the lethal power of owning a weapon. Or perhaps might discourage some from owning a weapon. It&apos;s quite easy to use a weapon in a moment of panic or anger, but then one has to live the rest of one&apos;s life for having made that decision. And contrary to how grunts in Vietnam have been portrayed in Hollywood war movies, most were obviously disturbed by what they had done when they had time to reflect upon their actions while they were recovering on the ward from their wounds. I know I have never been the same even though I was only a medical corpsman, a non-combatant, during the war.
