Who will Donald Trump pick for vice president? There are “five or six people” he’s looking at right now.

"I have a list of people that I would like," Trump said in an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday.

Trump said all of the people he’s interested in — and he hasn’t ruled out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is currently head of his transition team, he says — have held public office before.

"We don't need another business person," he said.

As for the vetting process, Trump thinks the political résumés of his choices will be easy to check because they’ve all been in the public eye for so long.

"For the most part, they've been vetted over the last 20 years," he said.

Trump's announcement that he has a list comes after multiple prominent Republicans (most recently Florida Sen. Marco Rubio) have said they didn't want to join his ticket. On Tuesday, he tweeted that he wasn't interested in any of them anyway.

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
