Shortly after Donald Trump crushed Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary that the Texan’s backers has set up as the final “firewall” against the billionaire’s seizure of the Republican Party, one of the GOP’s most ardent #NeverTrump activists was casting his gaze across the party line.

Wisconsin state Assembly majority leader Jim Steineke, a stalwart conservative who played a critical role in the most successful “Stop Trump” intervention in the Republican primary process—when Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, radio hosts and conservatives diehards rallied behind Cruz and delivered him a sweeping victory in the state’s April 5 primary—tweeted: “Might be time to check out this @GovGaryJohnson guy…. #JustSayin”				
					
					
That wasn’t any kind of formal endorsement. But Steineke, who announced that he was relinquishing his position as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in July was “#JustSayin” to reporters in Wisconsin, “At this point there is not a major party candidate who has earned my vote.” And the legislator was generous enough to tweet not just a reference to Johnson but a link to the Libertarian’s website—where Johnson seeks support from politically homeless #NeverTrumpkins.				
					
					
Johnson knows about disenchanted Republicans. A former GOP governor of New Mexico, he briefly sought the party’s 2012 presidential nomination. Johnson proved to be too open-minded for the GOP—the party and its media partners excluded him from the majority of the GOP debates—and jumped ship to the Libertarians that year. He is again seeking the Libertarian nomination this year. At the same time, he is making an overt appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans—opening a recent video with the line: “Two-term Republican governor Gary Johnson here…”				
					
					
Pitching himself as a fiscal conservative who supports free trade policies, Johnson sounds like an easy fit for renegade Republican establishment types—telling them, “Look, I can’t support Trump. You can’t either. We can fight for small government and conservative values.”

							“Look, I can’t support Trump. You can’t either.”
— Libertarian Gary Johnson’s appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans
						
 
Of course, it’s not that easy.				
					
					
Johnson is, like most Libertarians (and some Republicans), a big critic of big government—he says Milton Friedman is his favorite political philosopher, and calls for abolishing not just the Department of Education but also the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He also supports “entitlement reforms” so sweeping that they would make Paul Ryan salivate.				
					
					
But, unlike most Republicans, Johnson’s opposition to big government gets out of the conservative comfort zone. He’s an fierce critic of regime-change wars, and has supported deep cuts in military spending. “I do not know how you can have a discussion on cutting what we spend nationally without talking about military spending,” he said during the 2012 race, when he proposed a 43 percent cut in Pentagon spending. “Can we provide a strong national defense for our country and still reduce military spending by 43 percent?” asked Johnson. “My answer is: Yes. And the operative word would be ‘defense,’ as opposed to offense—as opposed to nation-building.”				
					
					
“[Bernie] Sanders, I think, is who I’m in line with when it comes to foreign policy,” Johnson told The Daily Caller in March. “Obviously, we’re 180 degrees [apart] when it comes to economics,” the Libertarian explained, correctly. But, he allowed as how he saw common ground with the democratic socialist “when it comes to foreign policy, when it comes to crony capitalism, when it comes to Europe, a woman’s right to choose, marijuana.”				
					
					
Johnson is also a fierce critic of the surveillance state, who thanked Edward Snowden at a 2013 “Stop Watching US: Rally Against Mass Surveillance” in Washington and decried NSA spying as “egregious government overreach.” At the same rally, he declared, “There’s only one way to fix the Patriot Act, and that’s to repeal the Patriot Act.”				
					
					
And don’t get Johnson started on the drug war. He made his name as a passionate advocate for legalization of marijuana and he says, “Would the world be better off if all drugs were legal? Yes. The world would be better off, [since] 90 percent of the drug problem is prohibition-related, not use related.”

							“(Bernie) Sanders, I think, is who I’m in line with when it comes to foreign policy.”
— Libertarian Gary Johnson
						
 
Even when he criticizes Trump, as he has for months, Johnson ends up taking positions that are so reasonable and responsible that he might unsettle many of the #NeverTrump conservatives who backed Cruz. For instance, Johnson says, “I really think that Donald Trump has the opportunity here to really take Republicans down and the Republican Party will no longer be if he’s the nominee. Starting out with deporting 11 million illegal immigrants, following that up by building a wall. As a border state governor, I’ll tell you that’s crazy.”				
					
					
That may be too much for some conservative Republicans. But Johnson is probably right when he says of the Trump moment, “If this isn’t an opportunity for the Libertarian nominee—and I hope to be the Libertarian nominee—there will never be an opportunity, in my opinion.”				
					
					
The Republican Party is in crisis. In a fully functional, multi-party democracy, where voters had a wide range of viable electoral options, the crisis would in all likelihood lead to a smooth transference of mainstream Republican votes to credible alternative party or to a new party. But the United States does not have a fully functional, multi-party democracy. The United States does not even have a moderately functional democracy.

So we are in uncharted territory here. Some responsible Republicans (and there are still a few) and some sincere conservatives (and there are still a few) will vote for Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. There are others who will simply refuse to vote. But there are many Republicans who are looking for an alternative. Some are still talking up the prospect of an independent run by one of their own—such as Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse—but that would require a fast and furious (and very expensive) fight for ballot lines. The Libertarians already have more than 30 ballot lines and, with Johnson on them, they might well be able to stake a claim on a chunk of #NeverTrump votes.				
					
					
Indeed, the magazine Reason reports that, on the night of the Indiana primary, shortly after Trump was positioned as the GOP’s presumptive nominee, Google Trends detected “a surge in searches for ‘Libertarian Party’” on the Internet. And when pollsters have included his name in their survey—a rare circumstance up to this point—they have detected something of a surge in support for Johnson. A March Monmouth University poll had Johnson at 11 percent, compared with 34 percent for Trump and 42 percent for Clinton.

Some responsible Republicans (and there are still a few) and some sincere conservatives (and there are still a few) will vote for Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. There are others who will simply refuse to vote. But there are many Republicans who are looking for an alternative. Some are still talking up the prospect of an independent run by one of their own—such as Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse—but that would require a fast and furious (and very expensive) fight for ballot lines. The Libertarians already have more than 30 ballot lines and, with Johnson on them, they might well be able to stake a claim on a chunk of #NeverTrump votes.				
					
					
Indeed, the magazine Reason reports that, on the night of the Indiana primary, shortly after Trump was positioned as the GOP’s presumptive nominee, Google Trends detected “a surge in searches for ‘Libertarian Party’” on the Internet. And when pollsters have included his name in their survey—a rare circumstance up to this point—they have detected something of a surge in support for Johnson. A March Monmouth University poll had Johnson at 11 percent, compared with 34 percent for Trump and 42 percent for Clinton.

							“Look, I can’t support Trump. You can’t either.”
— Libertarian Gary Johnson’s appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans
						


Of course, it’s not that easy.				
					
					
Johnson is, like most Libertarians (and some Republicans), a big critic of big government—he says Milton Friedman is his favorite political philosopher, and calls for abolishing not just the Department of Education but also the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He also supports “entitlement reforms” so sweeping that they would make Paul Ryan salivate.				
					
					
But, unlike most Republicans, Johnson’s opposition to big government gets out of the conservative comfort zone. He’s an fierce critic of regime-change wars, and has supported deep cuts in military spending. “I do not know how you can have a discussion on cutting what we spend nationally without talking about military spending,” he said during the 2012 race, when he proposed a 43 percent cut in Pentagon spending. “Can we provide a strong national defense for our country and still reduce military spending by 43 percent?” asked Johnson. “My answer is: Yes. And the operative word would be ‘defense,’ as opposed to offense—as opposed to nation-building.”				
					
					
“[Bernie] Sanders, I think, is who I’m in line with when it comes to foreign policy,” Johnson told The Daily Caller in March. “Obviously, we’re 180 degrees [apart] when it comes to economics,” the Libertarian explained, correctly. But, he allowed as how he saw common ground with the democratic socialist “when it comes to foreign policy, when it comes to crony capitalism, when it comes to Europe, a woman’s right to choose, marijuana.”				
					
					
Johnson is also a fierce critic of the surveillance state, who thanked Edward Snowden at a 2013 “Stop Watching US: Rally Against Mass Surveillance” in Washington and decried NSA spying as “egregious government overreach.” At the same rally, he declared, “There’s only one way to fix the Patriot Act, and that’s to repeal the Patriot Act.”				
					
					
And don’t get Johnson started on the drug war. He made his name as a passionate advocate for legalization of marijuana and he says, “Would the world be better off if all drugs were legal? Yes. The world would be better off, [since] 90 percent of the drug problem is prohibition-related, not use related.”

							“(Bernie) Sanders, I think, is who I’m in line with when it comes to foreign policy.”
— Libertarian Gary Johnson
						
 
Even when he criticizes Trump, as he has for months, Johnson ends up taking positions that are so reasonable and responsible that he might unsettle many of the #NeverTrump conservatives who backed Cruz. For instance, Johnson says, “I really think that Donald Trump has the opportunity here to really take Republicans down and the Republican Party will no longer be if he’s the nominee. Starting out with deporting 11 million illegal immigrants, following that up by building a wall. As a border state governor, I’ll tell you that’s crazy.”				
					
					
That may be too much for some conservative Republicans. But Johnson is probably right when he says of the Trump moment, “If this isn’t an opportunity for the Libertarian nominee—and I hope to be the Libertarian nominee—there will never be an opportunity, in my opinion.”				
					
					
The Republican Party is in crisis. In a fully functional, multi-party democracy, where voters had a wide range of viable electoral options, the crisis would in all likelihood lead to a smooth transference of mainstream Republican votes to credible alternative party or to a new party. But the United States does not have a fully functional, multi-party democracy. The United States does not even have a moderately functional democracy.

Some responsible Republicans (and there are still a few) and some sincere conservatives (and there are still a few) will vote for Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. There are others who will simply refuse to vote. But there are many Republicans who are looking for an alternative. Some are still talking up the prospect of an independent run by one of their own—such as Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse—but that would require a fast and furious (and very expensive) fight for ballot lines. The Libertarians already have more than 30 ballot lines and, with Johnson on them, they might well be able to stake a claim on a chunk of #NeverTrump votes.				
					
					
Indeed, the magazine Reason reports that, on the night of the Indiana primary, shortly after Trump was positioned as the GOP’s presumptive nominee, Google Trends detected “a surge in searches for ‘Libertarian Party’” on the Internet. And when pollsters have included his name in their survey—a rare circumstance up to this point—they have detected something of a surge in support for Johnson. A March Monmouth University poll had Johnson at 11 percent, compared with 34 percent for Trump and 42 percent for Clinton.

Kudos to John Nichols for writing about Gary Johnson as an alternative to the ghastly choice of either Trump or Clinton.  Both are odious creatures.

I consider myself a "Ron Paul Republican" with some liberal tendencies.  I supported Rand Paul but ended up voting for Bernie Sanders in the NH primary.  I align with Johnson pretty well so it looks like I will be voting LP this November.

If Sanders doesn&apos;t get the DEM nod, I think Sanders supporters should consider Johnson.

That a laugh.  We progressives have "Working Families" party, and the Green Party, which has a convention in August.  We don&apos;t need Libertarians, who want to go back to pre-civil war society (no  racial discrimination implied.)  The world has changed.  Those laissez faire days are gone forever. Legal pot, or not, if you are rich enough, you can still relish the simplicity of life with small government, and Big Business running the world.

America has simply been mismanaged for about 50 yrs

Sure, what is the flipside of &apos;small government&apos; ? BIG Corporate Power, largely in private hands. These so-called Libertarians are all a buncha weasels.

(1) "Free trade" is polling about as well as Congress, and rightfully so.  It was a scam from the beginning, serving only to enrich billionaires by gutting the middle class and hollowing out the economy.  "Republicans" who support TPP/TTIP/TiSA are right at home with Hillary; no need for a third party.    (2)  "Fiscal conservatism" has likewise been exposed as "continued largesse for the donor class + even more rugged free market for labor."  Again, Hillary has that locked up.    (3) Foreign Policy - Trump has campaigned on cleaning out the Neocons, ending our regime change obsession, and reducing wasteful military spending, even slaughtering the sacred cows of NATO and the MIC&apos;s new Cold War.  Trump is arguably better than Bernie on this topic, given the latter&apos;s past support for all manner of regime change and military spending (e.g., the F-35).     (4)  The Drug War - another subject on which Trump is out in front of Republicans.  He&apos;s pro-medical nationwide, and wants the states to handle recreational.  I&apos;d love for all drugs to be legalized, but we&apos;re in a minuscule minority.     (5) That leaves surveillance and immigration.  Thus far, Trump is abominable on surveillance.  He wouldn&apos;t be as bad as Hillary, but he wouldn&apos;t improve from Obama.  That said, let&apos;s see where he goes in the general.  On immigration, the reality is that strong immigration reform is much more popular than people want to admit.  As with "free trade," immigration suppresses wages through lower-priced labor supply.  The working class is literally dying, at a terrifying rate.  There&apos;s no good answer on this topic, but short of eliminating borders entirely and doing away with the concept of nation states, there has to be some balancing that actually factors in the interests of working class citizens (not just the donor class&apos;s interest in cheap labor) and foreigners on waiting lists for legal immigration.

Comparing Sanders to Trump is not fair to Trump or Sanders.   Sanders has a 30 year track record in politics and lawmaking.  Trump has 30 years of wheeling, dealing, hiring and firing, and entertaining.

I would love to vote for Sanders.  He&apos;s the best option by miles.  Sadly, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to be an option.  On foreign policy, Sanders would be a dramatic improvement over Obama, but he still supports and said he would continue the "drone war," supports air strikes against the Syrian government, and has voted in favor of countless "regime change" operations.  The main reason I give Trump higher marks is because he&apos;s been more forceful in denouncing the overthrow of Gaddafi and of Saddam, saying it would be better if they were still in power, and because he&apos;s been more forceful in bucking the company line on Russia.  Here&apos;s a couple summaries on Bernie&apos;s foreign policy past - http://original.antiwar.com/chris_ernesto/2015/11/13/bernie-war-and-the-empires-pie/; http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/bernie-sanders-troubling-history-supporting-us-military-violence-abroad

I agree with much of this assessment but am sad to see further repetition of the meme that job loss is largely due to immigration. Middle-class job loss likely has far more to do with the off-shore-ing of operations by major employers in search of cheaper labor and lax regulatory structures. For example, the timing of the Carrier Corp. announcement was suggested as a factor in the success of Sanders and Trump in the recent Indiana primary.

Yet in the still larger perspective, a trend no one seems willing to address is that, due to advances technology and other industrial processes, going forward, we simply are not going to need as many people to do the necessary work -- and continuing to search for ever more inventive ways to extract, produce, and consume is putting an unsustainable strain on the ecosystem.

I acknowledge that this won&apos;t fit into an easy sound-bite for the campaign trail, but it is probably time to start envisioning a post-labor society where the primary goal is to become better people and citizens, not simply worker drones.

I never claimed that job loss was primarily due to immigration.  It&apos;s a small factor in comparison to "free trade," but it&apos;s still a factor.  It increases the supply of lower-priced labor, thereby suppressing wages.  It also negatively impacts unionization, the death of which is a big reason why our country has been gradually dying over the last 40 years.

"he says Milton Friedman is his favorite political philosopher"  - Johnson should read "Shock Doctrine" to see the Mafioso tactics Friedman&apos;s disciples committed trying to implement Friedman&apos;s "philosophy all over the world.  Thousands tortured, died, and disappeared.   What kind of weed is this guy smoking?

Ha. He&apos;s the only libertarian who agrees with a woman&apos;s right to choose, although he does not approve of abortion, according to his web site. He does not agree with government intervention unlike the other leaning libertarian Rand Paul. A sliver of light in otherwise bleak environment.

Libertarians have some good ideas, but if they had their way, most African Americans, and some "tempest tossed" whites, many elderly, would have died of starvation and disease a long time ago.  "Survival of the fittest" means death if you don&apos;t "fit."  You seldom see a "libertarian" that is not white and middle class (or higher) income.
