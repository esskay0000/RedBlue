BUFFALO — Hillary Clinton on Friday said that she does think that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is qualified to be president and called his questioning of her qualifications a "complete misrepresentation."

"He made those comments and there was no basis for them," Clinton told reporters at Buffalo's Charlie the Butcher restaurant. "It was completely a misrepresentation."

"And he seemed to take them back today. I don't know why he made them in the first place, but I'm going to go on and talk about the issues," she added.

Clinton's comments came after a day of back and forth with the Sanders campaign over the issue of qualifications. Earlier in the week Clinton was asked in a "Morning Joe" interview whether Sanders was qualified for the presidency, but she did not give a yes or no response. Sanders followed by saying that she was not qualified, setting off an uproar among her supporters. Earlier Friday, Sanders changed his tone, saying that "of course" Clinton is qualified for the presidency.

Asked again on Friday in Buffalo if Sanders was qualified, Clinton said simply: "Yes."

"As I said I would take him over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any day," Clinton added.

On a separate issue, Clinton was asked about former president Bill Clinton's conflict with Black Lives Matter activists at a rally in Philadelphia on Thursday.

She said that she agrees with his subsequent comments, made on Friday, that "we all need to be listening to each other."

"I think it's important that where we have disagreements and differences ... let's begin to talk and listen to each other," Clinton said.
