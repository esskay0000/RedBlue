WAR ZONE MEDICINE Working as a doctor in wartime is always a risky and treacherous business, but the dangers are even more pronounced when the war in question is raging in Syria, where hospitals and medical facilities have become targets of recent airstrikes. The Washington Post profiles one doctor — a neurosurgeon in the particularly war-ravaged city of Aleppo, where doctors number only about one per 10,000 residents remaining — who won’t leave, despite numerous strikes on his hospital.

NEW ALLIANCES IN ISIS WAR The changing maps of alliances in the fight against the Islamic State on the ground is often difficult to conceptualize, but a Reuters report from this morning gives a glimpse into how two groups seemingly at odds are coming together in a corner of Iraq, despite competing motivations and at times, cross-purposes in their reasons for fighting the Islamic State. But the marriages of convenience cropping up around the country are bright spots at a time when the country is splintering and international powers are worrying about how they can keep coalitions fashioned to fight of terror groups in the midst of national fracturing.

WILL CLINTON EXPOSE THE X-FILES? Hillary Clinton seems to have won over the UFO enthusiast community, the New York Times reports, hinting on several occasions that she might try to release government information about Area 51, the Air Force facility in Nevada that many believe is where the government also keeps secret information on aliens and other encounters with extraterrestrial life forms. Turns out Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta is a huge fan of “The X-Files,” the Fox TV series that was big back when the Clintons were in the White House, and the Democratic presidential candidate herself has been “sympathetic” to his persuasions. This is not expected to be a pivotal issue for voters concerned with the economy and foreign policy. But for those who care most about other life on Earth, it could prove useful information. The article does not, however, get into where Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders stand on UFOs.
