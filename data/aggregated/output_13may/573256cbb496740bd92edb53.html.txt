Does the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency make you want to move to Canada?

Well, now you can. Or at least you can try and find a nice Canadian to help you live there. A new dating site says it will help you find a Canadian partner to “Make dating great again.”



“Maple Match makes it easy for Americans to find the ideal Canadian partner to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency.”

It is not clear if the website is real or a joke, as it is not currently matching North American pairs. There is a waitlist button and a pre-written tweet sharing information about the site.

"Looking for a #Canadian to shack up with in case of a #Trump victory? Join the movement at @MapleMatch!" the tweet reads.
