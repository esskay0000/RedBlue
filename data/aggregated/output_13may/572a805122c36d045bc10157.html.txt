FLINT, Mich. — President Obama visited this city Wednesday to bolster public confidence over its contaminated drinking water and took a sip of filtered water in front of reporters to drive home his point that efforts to mitigate the crisis are beginning to work.

Obama met with federal and local officials shortly after Air Force One landed to discuss the response to the toxic levels of lead found in drinking water in this city of 100,000. Residents have relied on bottled water for drinking and bathing for months, but Obama emphasized that they can begin to drink the water if they flush their taps each day and use a regulated filter.

He encouraged parents to get blood tests for children who have been exposed to the water, which became contaminated in April 2014 after state officials switched the water source for the city without adding required chemicals to prevent lead from leeching from aging service pipes.

The president said his administration is intent on making sure "the people of Flint are healthy, that they've got safe water to drink and to use, that we are ensuring that we have a plan for this system to work over the long-term."

Asked by a reporter if it was local water in a glass in front of him, Obama took a sip.

"Normally, I do not engage in stunts," he said, but he took a drink. "The water around this table was Flint water that was filtered. It confirms what we know scientifically that if you use a filter ... then Flint water at this point is drinkable. That does not negate the need to replace some of those pipes, because ultimately we want a system where you don't have to put a filter on it."
