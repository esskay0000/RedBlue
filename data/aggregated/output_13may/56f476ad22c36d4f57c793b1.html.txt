On March 11, a group of prominent Argentine human-rights activists presented a poignant petition to the US Embassy in Buenos Aires. They asked for the cooperation of the US government to advance the “process of memory, truth and justice relating to the crimes against humanity committed in our country” during the military dictatorship that left over 20,000 desaparecidos—citizens detained by state security agents and murdered, but never found. They requested that President Obama use his authority to declassify still-secret US government archives “that would reveal the fate and truth of our disappeared,” as well as the babies born to secretly detained—and subsequently executed—pregnant women, who were then given to military officers for adoption.

						});
					
On March 14, US National Security Adviser Susan Rice publicly stated that Obama will “announce a comprehensive effort to declassify additional documents, including for the first time military and intelligence records,” when he travels to Argentina on March 23.				
					
					
While much media attention has focused on Obama’s historic trip to Cuba, his visit to Argentina falls on the 40th anniversary of the March 24, 1976, military coup. For weeks, White House officials have considered how Obama could pay appropriate homage to that painful date in Argentine history and use the power of the presidency to make a meaningful gesture, as Rice stated, “to underscore our shared commitment to human rights.” A special declassification project of still-secret CIA, Defense Department, and FBI records not only would reveal concrete evidence regarding unresolved atrocities in Argentina, but also offer a long-overdue acknowledgment of US support for the ensuing repression in the months following the military takeover. “This anniversary and beyond,” Rice said, “we’re determined to do our part as Argentina continues to heal and move forward as one nation.”

What the US government knew, and what actions it took at the time of the coup, remain hidden in those still-classified operational intelligence files. But the policy of support for the military takeover that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger immediately adopted has emerged from records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and archival research. Only two days after the coup, according to declassified State Department minutes of Kissinger’s staff meetings, his Latin American specialists warned him “to expect a fair amount of repression, probably a good deal of blood, in Argentina.” Kissinger, however, issued these instructions on US policy toward the new military junta: “Whatever chance they have, they will need a little encouragement…because I do want to encourage them. I don’t want to give the sense that they’re harassed by the United States.”				
					
					
The secretary of state personally transmitted that message. According to a secret memorandum of conversation (obtained under the FOIA by our organization, the National Security Archive) some ten weeks after the coup, Kissinger met with Argentina’s new foreign minister, Adm. César Guzzetti, in Santiago, Chile. When Guzzetti alerted Kissinger that the military was moving aggressively against “the terrorists,” Kissinger responded, “If there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly.” Even after his Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, Harry Shlaudeman, informed Kissinger that the military junta had decided to adopt “the Chilean method…to terrorize the opposition—even killing priests and nuns and others,” Kissinger reiterated this message to Guzzetti in yet another meeting in New York in October 1976. “Look, our basic attitude is that we would like you to succeed,” Kissinger told the junta’s foreign minister. “I have an old-fashioned view that friends ought to be supported. What is not understood in the United States is that you have a civil war. We read about human rights problems but not the context. The quicker you succeed the better.” The US ambassador to Buenos Aires, Robert Hill, subsequently reported that Guzzetti returned from this meeting believing that Kissinger “gave the green light” for the generals to pursue their repression.				
					
					
Over the next seven years, that repression cost the lives of thousands of citizens, and the torture of thousands more. Argentine security forces created a network of secret detention-interrogation-torture-execution camps, and then disappeared victims by dumping their bodies from helicopters into the ocean. Argentina also became a central country in Operation Condor—the clandestine, cross-border collaboration of Southern Cone military regimes, led by Augusto Pinochet’s Chile, to track down and eliminate militant and civilian critics around the world.

The operational files, intelligence reports, and cable traffic of the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the FBI contain detailed evidence on the state-sponsored terrorism that took place in Argentina. Yet 40 years after many of these documents were written, they remain classified—beyond the reach of human rights activists, victims’ families, and legal authorities seeking to hold military officials accountable for their crimes. During the last year of the Clinton administration, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did authorize a special declassification of 4,700 revealing State Department documents; one of them, a confidential 1982 memorandum of conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams and an Argentine diplomat, addressed the issue of the disappeared grandchildren and became a key piece of evidence in a trial that convicted high-ranking Argentine military officers of kidnapping. But even more revelatory records in the SCIFS—Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facilities—of the CIA and US military remain secret to this day.				
					
					
In a gesture of declassified diplomacy to the Argentine human rights community and the victims of atrocities, President Obama will order those documents reviewed for release as he commemorates the fortieth anniversary of the coup on March 24 by visiting the Parque de Memoria in Buenos Aires. The multi-agency process of centralizing, evaluating, redacting, and declassifying hundreds of such records is likely to take until the end of his tenure in office. Moreover, if previous special declassifications involving the intelligence community are any indication, the “securocrats” in the CIA will resist the president’s directive and attempt to withhold valuable, if self-incriminating, records from release.				
					
					
Yet the fact that the president of the United States is ready to open the Pandora’s box of secrets on Argentina and assist the pursuit of truth and justice reflects his commitment to redress the past by making it accessible. His decision to declassify will not only reveal history, it will make history—for the human rights movement in Argentina, and around the world.

Yet 40 years after many of these documents were written, they remain classified—beyond the reach of human rights activists, victims’ families, and legal authorities seeking to hold military officials accountable for their crimes. During the last year of the Clinton administration, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did authorize a special declassification of 4,700 revealing State Department documents; one of them, a confidential 1982 memorandum of conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams and an Argentine diplomat, addressed the issue of the disappeared grandchildren and became a key piece of evidence in a trial that convicted high-ranking Argentine military officers of kidnapping. But even more revelatory records in the SCIFS—Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facilities—of the CIA and US military remain secret to this day.				
					
					
In a gesture of declassified diplomacy to the Argentine human rights community and the victims of atrocities, President Obama will order those documents reviewed for release as he commemorates the fortieth anniversary of the coup on March 24 by visiting the Parque de Memoria in Buenos Aires. The multi-agency process of centralizing, evaluating, redacting, and declassifying hundreds of such records is likely to take until the end of his tenure in office. Moreover, if previous special declassifications involving the intelligence community are any indication, the “securocrats” in the CIA will resist the president’s directive and attempt to withhold valuable, if self-incriminating, records from release.				
					
					
Yet the fact that the president of the United States is ready to open the Pandora’s box of secrets on Argentina and assist the pursuit of truth and justice reflects his commitment to redress the past by making it accessible. His decision to declassify will not only reveal history, it will make history—for the human rights movement in Argentina, and around the world.

Personally, I&apos;m willing to bet most of the really damaging information never sees the light of day.  When we have a current Democratic candidate for POTUS actively seeking the counsel of Henry Kissinger do we really think anything to show his part in this would really ever be revealed?

I met a psychiatrist (The Dirty Wars didn&apos;t only terrorise and kidnap priests and nuns it targeted mental health professionals who spoke out), a friend of my Argentina friend, soon after he was let go by the Argentina dictatorship (approximately in 1976) after being tortured for a month. In Berkeley in those days we went to a party which had a large hot tub. I balanced (call him Guillermo) on my knee and massaged his shoulders. He wasn&apos;t &apos;in&apos; his body. He just wasn&apos;t there. And driving to get to Mar in he didn&apos;t look around as a normal person being in a new city for the first time would have done; he just stared blankly straight ahead. We did a stupid thing by taking him to a nude hot tub party (not orgy, just a party without clothes as happened in the &apos;70s). His torture had consisted of repeated dunking in deep tubs of water I found out later. We should have piled den more clothes on him and wrapped him in blankets and sung to him.)
He then went to Spain and sent for his family, where they waited out the Dirty War. My friend told me Guillermo told him that the 14-year old son of one of their friends was among the disappeareds. I assume Guillermo recovered his body and mind as time went on. I hope.

There are two movies about the aftermath of the Dirty War&apos;s effects on grandchildren, who were stolen as babies from pregnant young women who were tortured and killed. &apos;Cautiva&apos; (Captive), in which the new government captures a 15-year old girl who is told her family (a general and his wife) is not her family and her mother was killed by the very generals she has grown up with. She is returned to her grandmother and aunts and cousins.
Also, &apos;The Official Story&apos; with Norma Alexandre., in which a university professor finds out, from an old woman who walks weekly, with a sign protesting and inquiring about her missing daughter in the square, that her (Aleandro&apos;s) adopted daughter may be her grand-daughter. Then she 
has to decide whether to give the girl up to her real grandmother. 

-- Re: Kissinger, friend of Hillary Clinton, what if, in the future, when its too late, we read declassified documents showing how deeply she was in, as Secretary of State, into enabling the military coup of Manuel Zelaya, democratically elected president of Honduras. Her part, and her and Bill&apos;s friend Lanny Davis, who was a paid lobbyist and consultant for the coup, have been in the news for over a year, largely under circumstantial evidence. Zelaya was reportedly kidnapped and flown to a U.S. military base. Since the coup Honduras has become &apos;the murder capital of the wotld&apos; and it&apos;s citizens the highest proportion of the migrants fleeing for their lives to the U.S.
Apparently the top &apos;Diez&apos;, the richest families in Honduras, were threatened by Zelaya&apos;s actions as president, such as raising the minimum wage. Somehow Hillary considered this regime change &apos;in our interests&apos;.

The following link is to a National Security Archive on Kissinger&apos;s involvement in Argentina&apos;s affairs between 1976 and 1978.  It&apos;s very revealing.
