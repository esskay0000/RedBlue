Enemies of Harry Reid, beware as he gets ready to retire.

The Senate minority leader laid into Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) Wednesday during a closed-door meeting of House progressives, calling him crooked and saying he deserves to lose his Senate primary bid over allegations he improperly maintained a hedge fund in the Cayman Islands after his election.

The encounter took place after Grayson stood up and criticized Reid for calling on him to drop out of the Senate race over the ongoing ethics investigation.

“Shame on you. It’s not true,” Grayson reportedly told Reid, referring to the ethics allegations. “It is true, and I want you to lose,” Reid fired back.

Reid stood behind his comment in a statement, calling Grayson “disruptive” and an embarrassment to his colleagues.

“Senator Reid took the opportunity to express his low opinion of Congressman Grayson to his face and remind him that the reason Senator Reid has said that Grayson is under ethics investigation and appears to be running a Cayman Islands hedge fund from his Congressional office in order to line his own pockets is because these things are true, as established by seventy-four pages’ worth of evidence from the Congressional Ethics Office,” spokeswoman Kristen Orthman stated.

The Florida Senate race to replace departing Sen. Marco Rubio (R) is one of the most competitive in the country and will help determine which party controls the Senate after November. Grayson is locked in a heated primary with Rep. Patrick Murphy (Fla.) for the Democratic nod, while a pair of Republican lawmakers join other contenders for the GOP title. The primary isn’t until Aug. 30, and no party has a clear advantage, according to recent polling — though Murphy was ahead in some general election match-ups.

Grayson replied to Reid’s slam on Twitter, painting Reid as a member of the “corrupt establishment:”

You may be wondering why the corrupt Establishment is so hell bent on defeating me. The reason is simple: they don’t own me. They hate that.

He then unleashed a tweet storm aiming to explain his confronting Reid:

Calling out the Establishment is never easy, and it's not always polite… (1/4)

I had a rare moment to challenge the lies that Sen. Reid has spread about me, and… (2/4)

Reid made it clear that he's too heavily invested in the GOP puppet he's calling a Dem Senate candidate to consider the truth… (3/4)

Sen. Reid ought to learn that ‘I want you to lose’ is no excuse for a gross smear. But the air is cleared. (4/4)

Grayson told reporters neither he nor any members of his staff have been contacted by the Justice Department. He would not comment on his interaction with the House Ethics Committee.

“All I’m asking for is something pretty simple,” Grayson said. “Don’t lie about me … If he had any proof of what he said that was the time to say it.”

A report by the Office of Congressional Ethics released in April found Grayson might have violated congressional rules and federal law by running a hedge fund while he served in Congress.

“It said the lawmaker maintained interests in a law firm and a corporation bearing his name despite potential conflicts of interest with his work as a House member and failed to properly disclose income, assets and other information pertaining to his official positions and financial holdings,” PowerPost reported.

The Florida Democrat’s feud with Reid, first reported by The Hill, is already attracting attention on Twitter:
