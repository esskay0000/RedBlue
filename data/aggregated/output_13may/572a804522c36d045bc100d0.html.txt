OK, let’s get some things straight: Senator Ted Cruz won’t have an actual “running mate,” because he won’t have a presidential candidacy much longer. And if he did, against all odds, get the GOP nomination at a contested convention, he would dump poor Carly Fiorina as fast as you can say “swing state.” Fiorina is no electoral draw: She won exactly one delegate in the GOP primary; she lost her 2010 campaign to be California’s senator, badly; and if Cruz was hoping she might somehow swing California, anyway, that’s seems like bad advance work, because she doesn’t even live in California anymore. Speaking as a recently transplanted Californian myself, she is wildly despised there. Nationwide, her favorable rating is 25 percent. Finally, in a year when the GOP is having to reckon with the revolt of its white, working-class base, I can’t think of a worse choice to challenge Trump than an icy former CEO who shed workers with less conscience than Trump has shed wives.

Other than that, she’s a brilliant choice.		
But since the 2016 GOP presidential race is all lurid spectacle and strategic dysfunction, let’s take a moment to appreciate how both were displayed in Cruz’s Fiorina announcement.		
First, it came only three days after the Texas senator’s abortive pact with John Kasich. I mean, really, if you were going to seriously team up with Kasich to thwart Trump, wouldn’t you try to make him your running mate? In fact, wouldn’t you, earlier, have tried to lure Senator Marco Rubio? Or anyone with more than the literally one delegate controlled, right now, by Carly Fiorina?

But let’s give Cruz credit: He’s trying to win over the women’s vote, given that 70 percent of women tell pollsters they have “negative” feelings—what a euphemism—about Donald Trump. He picked Fiorina right as Trump was trashing Hillary Clinton for playing “the woman card,” insisting if she “were a man, she would have 5 percent of the vote.” Clinton immediately embraced the insult, with her campaign producing a “woman card” with her logo, while feminists on Twitter and elsewhere outdid themselves mocking the idiocy of the concept that being a woman is any kind of advantage in the world (this piece is my favorite.)		
One big problem with Cruz’s strategy, though, is that there are few female candidates as poorly situated to capture women’s votes as Fiorina. Her failed presidential campaign’s only rationale seemed to be that she could brutalize Clinton politically without being derided as sexist. She then became infamous for her cold-blooded lies about the doctored Planned Parenthood videos, including the morbid and oft-repeated false claim that they depicted infanticide. Sarah Palin was a smarter choice to appeal to women than Fiorina is—and Palin was a disaster.		
The other problem with this obvious desperation move is that Cruz and Fiorina appeal to the same narrow base of Christian conservatives. Somehow that became more ridiculously apparent to me when Cruz seemed to introduce Fiorina—to a small, lackluster Indiana rally—as someone who was going to be his nanny, bizarrely playing up her relationship with his two young daughters. For her part, Fiorina seemed to very much want the job, coming out on stage and crooning a song to young Caroline and Catherine, in a display of political pandering that was unforgettably creepy. Again, I think there was political strategy, however deranged, behind the odd tableau: Fiorina has a seriously harsh persona, so this was supposed to humanize her. It also seemed to appease Christian conservative misgivings about powerful women—Fiorina is at once fit to be commander in chief, if anything were to happen to Cruz, as well as to care for his daughters.		
But nothing is going to happen to Cruz; he will go on trying to defeat Trump with incompetence and futility. He will not be the GOP nominee, let alone president. In fact, Fiorina is perfectly suited to tell us why: As she said during her own failed campaign, Cruz is “just like any other politician” who “says whatever he needs to say to get elected,” and he “cannot possibly beat Hillary Clinton.” He can’t beat Clinton—and, more relevant to his immediate aim of getting the Republican nomination, he can’t beat Trump. But he and Fiorina gave us a day of surreal political theater, a day in which Trump’s incoherent foreign policy was not the strangest thing to happen, and I’m grateful.

I agree with Ms. Walsh&apos;s characterization of Carly Fiorina. She comes across as harsh and uncaring. However, there is one aspect of Carly Fiorina&apos;s sort of candidacy that is far superior to that of Hillary Clinton: She established her political connections without relying on her husband. As a woman, I am very bothered by the fact that Hillary Clinton would be nowhere without the power of her husband&apos;s positions as governor and president. That is not a positive for the cause of equal opportunity for women.

At the risk of sounding insensitive to women everywhere, this point comparing Fiorina to Clinton is really detached from the reality being discussed here.  I, like many others, despise Carly Fiorina so much that how she made her connections for herself is just as horrid and ugly a topic as the woman herself.  I mean, who gives a damn?  She almost ran a major company into the ground with her "connections."  Hillary is pretty revolting also, but the whole thing is essentially moot.

Well spoke Ms. Walsh. Surreal political theater is what Mr. Cruz is all about. This just supports his well developed shtick of being Mr. Outsider who gets along with nobody, and is proud that he has no friends other than his thin phalanx of supporters. Well spoke.

I used to enjoy Joan Walsh&apos;s writing.  As of late, this thing with Hillary Clinton has really brought down the quality of her work, at least from what I&apos;m seeing at The Nation.  My guess is the majority of readers here do not share her enthusiasm for the Goldwater Girl, and are going to end up voting for her if they have to but sure as hell hating it.  Why do you go on and on, Joan?
As to Fiorina/Cruz, there&apos;s really no need for much analysis.  The two individuals are both really horrid, the kind of horrid that I personally would not want to meet either even if I was paid to do so.   I guess if Joan wants to go on about them, she can do it away from here in California.  She sure sounds increasingly absorbed in a world most of us are not that fond of.

Can anyone drive me away from The Nation faster than Joan Walsh? Not likely.

Fine analysis, but one quibble: "Speaking as a recently transplanted Californian myself, she is wildly despised there." As a 2007 transplant to California, I&apos;d hope the "wildly" is a typo. Otherwise, it&apos;s a bit over the top: Among Californians who follow politics carefully, Fiorina is *widely* despised. More normal folk seem to have vague memories of her campaigns and when reminded of her CEO work or the grotesque schtick on Planned Parenthood — for a Republican presidential candidate, she wasn&apos;t utterly awful on immigration — put in the effort to dislike her. Given renewed exposure, Fiorina may earn the contempt of a lot of Californians, but for now the general attitude may be mostly forgetful indifference tinged with aversion.

God, Alexandra Petri makes me so jealous! One benefit of the Woman Card that she neglected to mention is that it gets you an appreciative audience when you’re on the treadmill or the elliptical machine in the gym. Where Hillary is concerned, I think she was wise to dial back on the “grandmother” stuff, despite what Leslie Stahl may think, because it’s the Grandma Card that Trump really wants to play. That emphasis might endear her further to people who are already “with her,” but when it comes to, for example, winning (back) the white working-class male vote – Grandma with her finger on the nuclear button or getting the 3am call? Forget it.

Why does this Clinton shill still get published/paid by The Nation?

I love Joan Walsh&apos;s savvy comments and outlook on this race.

Are you her mother?

Unfortunately, Mr Bernhardt, that&apos;s just crass ignorance. Joan Walsh&apos;s mother died of cancer at a relatively young age (in her forties), when her three children were still in their teens.

Any relation? Haha, just kidding. For the record, if this is a moment for standing up to be counted, then let me say that I too appreciate and enjoy Joan&apos;s work. The Nation is lucky to have her. I just wish, selfishly, that she&apos;d post more often. #I&apos;mwithher

WTF? You talking about Joan Walsh?  She has a lot more credibility than you do Mr. Muratrolly.  I take it you think that Mr. Cruz&apos;s choice was smart, well reasoned and politically savvy?  Please.

What&apos;s a person to do when the task at hand is brain surgery, and all you have in the tool box are pipe wrenches, 12" and larger.  Cruz and Trump are not mental giants, and their advisers are much the same, so the pipe wrench suits them to a "T".  We can look forward to more of the same.  2016: A year that will live in infamy.

Cooz could have chosen any other woman on the planet and made more sense.
