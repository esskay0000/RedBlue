As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump has some interesting and unique rhetorical patterns. He repeats himself. He uses interruptions in his speeches to rile up his crowd and foster an "us-versus-them" atmosphere. And above all, he tries to project confidence -- impenetrable, invincible confidence.

Perhaps that desire explains why he so often speaks for "everyone" or "everybody." Trump regularly makes assertions about what "everyone" thinks or knows, although those assertions are almost always debatable at best and flat-wrong at worst.

This device is more often employed when Trump is defending himself or attacking an opponent. Some examples:

"I never went bankrupt, by the way. You know, everybody knows." -- Sept. 16, 2015, GOP debate

"[Jeb Bush] is so weak on immigration; it's laughable. And everybody knows it." -- Feb. 13, 2016, GOP debate

"I get along with everyone." -- Repeatedly, both in interviews and on the campaign trail

And Trump's assertions about what "everyone" knows predate the election. There was even a time, in 2013, when "everybody" knew that his hair was real. Yet somehow the questions have persisted.

As everybody knows, but the haters & losers refuse to acknowledge, I do not wear a “wig.” My hair may not be perfect but it’s mine.

Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.

One of the biggest knocks on Trump as a candidate is that he doesn't know his way around the issues. He counters that argument by saying he has a "great brain" and that he knows how to make tough decisions under pressure. Using the word "everyone" when making an assertion about a policy idea serves a few purposes: It theoretically makes it easier for voters to hop on board (Everyone thinks that? Well, I sure do, too!), and it gives Trump's statements more weight. It's not just Trump saying these things – it's ALL of us!

As with much of what Trump says -- from Mexico building his border wall to being the greatest jobs president God ever created -- Trump is clearly hoping that saying it makes it true. If he says everyone knows it, no matter how few people actually believe it, perhaps everyone will soon enough.
