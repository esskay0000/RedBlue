To hear some people tell it, there is no greater threat to the Republic at the moment than political correctness. It forces dissenters to cower before views they would ordinarily reject, out of fear that they will be labeled as bigots. It thwarts attempts at finding common-sense solutions to the country’s problems. It stifles open debate and free inquiry. So negative has the term become that no one is ever heard saying, “I’m proud to be politically correct.” Admitting to political correctness is tantamount to admitting that there are limits on one’s speech and, by implication, on one’s thoughts. Conversely, refusing to bow to standards of respect demanded by various groups is supposed to convey a deep commitment to unadorned truths.

What truths are so sorely missing from our national conversation? Undocumented Mexican immigrants are, according to Donald Trump, potential drug dealers, criminals, and rapists. The businesses that severed ties with him over these incendiary statements have taken “the weak and very sad position of being politically correct,” Trump declared. Banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States is “probably not politically correct,” he said, “but I don’t care.” In February, Trump lamented that ISIS terrorists are “cutting off the heads of Christians,” but we’re “too politically correct to respond in kind.”				
			

							While Trump demands the right to insult others, he appears curiously sensitive to criticism about himself.
						
 
But political correctness isn’t a bête noire for Trump alone. At a presidential town hall in February, Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted that having women serve in the front lines of combat “makes no sense at all” and that “the military should [not] be governed by political correctness.” Ohio Governor John Kasich, the supposed moderate in the race, claimed that the March terrorist attacks in Brussels could have been foiled if not for—you guessed it—political correctness. And last month, North Carolina passed a law that bars transgender people from using bathrooms and locker rooms that don’t match their gender identity at birth. When confronted about the discriminatory aspect of the legislation, Governor Pat McCrory complained that “political correctness has gone amok.”				
					
					
These responses work like wild cards, played at convenient moments in a political game. And like wild cards, they have no inherent merit. For example, when Trump suggests that the United States “respond in kind” to ISIS terrorists, he is not only proposing that we bring back torture—an immoral practice, not to mention an illegal and ineffective one—he is also legitimizing other punitive measures favored by ISIS like beheading, crucifixion, and sexual slavery. How many voters would be willing to take political incorrectness and “responding in kind” to that level? Similarly, when Cruz says that women should not register for the Selective Service, he is clearly implying that the ability to fire a weapon or pilot a fighter jet is limited by gender. And when McCrory says that North Carolina’s new law doesn’t take away existing rights, he means that it doesn’t take away the rights of men and women who unambiguously present as such.

The resurgence of the war over political correctness has coincided with the rise of Trump. (Google Trends shows an uptick in the usage of the term in July 2015, right after he announced his candidacy.) In the last few years, the country has undergone changes that have created a well of anxiety about the future among people who once enjoyed, if not economic or educational advantages, at least racial and gender privileges. Trump has managed to tap into that anxiety and to recast the loss of privilege as a form of oppression. As a result, his blunt and offensive statements are greeted with good humor, while his authoritarian proposals are mistaken for some kind of painful yet necessary truths.				
					
					
But while Trump demands the right to openly insult others, he appears to be curiously sensitive to criticism about himself. At a rally in Fort Worth in February, he promised that, if he were elected president, he would expand libel laws. “When The New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when The Washington Post…writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected.” In Trump’s view, therefore, the First Amendment protects him when he refers to undocumented immigrants as rapists, but it must be curtailed when the media writes critically about him.

The other Republican contenders have struggled to keep up with Trump’s outlandish statements, but their records are just as checkered. Kasich, for instance, once demanded that Blockbuster remove the Oscar-winning film Fargo from its shelves because he deemed it “graphic and brutal.” (I tend to think that the Iraq War, which Kasich supported, was far more graphic and brutal than any movie by the Coen brothers, but maybe that’s just me.)				
					
					
On his campaign website, Cruz says that liberal campuses are kowtowing to political correctness and asks voters to join him in ending liberal “safe spaces.” This is a familiar complaint in conservative publications, where college campuses are frequently portrayed as places where young people are coddled, given trigger warnings about emotionally upsetting material, and generally prevented from hearing difficult or dissenting views. So one might expect Cruz to be a staunch defender of open debate at universities. But in a speech to AIPAC last month, Cruz said he would cut off federal funding for any schools that financially support the BDS movement. Not only is Cruz suggesting that nonviolent opposition to Israeli policies isn’t an acceptable form of free speech, but he has also promised to prosecute those who dare to support such views.				
					
					
If political correctness has “gone amok,” it is because Republicans like Trump and Cruz have relentlessly invoked it as a straw man to justify bigoted comments about immigrants, Muslims, women, and others. But doing so cannot hide the fact that they cannot abide by the very free-speech values they claim to cherish.

The term "Political Correctness" really has many meanings. In its origin it may have meant "in keeping with moral and ethic standards as prescribed by the Constitution". But since these are seldom the values that the government in Washington applies, the term political correctness shifted to mean "acceptable to the establishment in Washington". When Trump lamented that they chop off heads in the Middle East and that we can&apos;t reciprocate for political correctness, he didn&apos;t really mean that we should chop off heads in kind, but that we should have fought ISIS hard and deadly. And he is right in this. Russia who did just that changed both the seeming invincibility and therefore capacity to instill fear of ISIS and made genuine progress towards ending the war, whereas the US who tried to only "contain" ISIS so as to be able to still use it for other, dark political gimmicks, did not have any effect in stopping the bloodbath and cruelty of ISIS. Conversely, when Cruz uses the term it is really just to underline his "differentness" from the establishment, most often when he is really entirely "politically correct", namely in unison with the mainstream in Washington. 

In defense of Trump - his assertion that he would reintroduce water boarding is less troubling than the ongoing torture by the US government, concealed and veiled as "harsh interrogation", "stress positions". "sleep deprivation", "temperature use" to overheat or undercool a person and so many psychological ways to mentally disorient a person. All of these techniques are torture. Just because they don&apos;t result in measurable physical damage does not mean that they are not torture. That definition was merely a way to circumvent a more inclusive definition of torture as used in international law. Indefinite detention without any accusations of crime or trial is also a form of torture. So is decades of solitary confinement as practiced in Guantanamo and inside the USA. What Trump reacted against is precisely this hypocrisy of refusing blunt retaliation in kind as illegal under the laws against torture while refusing to call equally abusive and painful procedures torture. Nor was there equal outrage to Cruz&apos;s assertion that he would "carpet bomb the Middle East until the sand glows red". But that doesn&apos;t matter because the establishment is afraid of Trump because they can&apos;t control him - he isn&apos;t dependent on special interest money from which the rest of Congress makes its wealth - and therefore want to undermine and destroy his campaign. In what way are such methods from the establishment "politically correct" or even acceptable? They aren&apos;t. But the author doesn&apos;t care because she accepts that Trump is bad. I don&apos;t accept that, therefore I refute to accept the "politically correct" methods of destruction.

I always thought "politically correct" was something like "socially correct" or being considerate of others, the negative of the term can only be construed  as "hypocritical" in being considerate, I imagine, for self-serving purposes.  But I never thought of one being sincere in their "political correct" -ness, as anything wrong.  I believe the "neos" (neo-liberals, neo-conservatives) have corrupted the term to mean ALL social considerateness and ALL politeness, within politics is hypocrisy - easy to believe, if you believe almost ALL politicians are, in fact, hypocrites, and all progressives are hypocrites.

Ask them to define politically correct?  I tried with my brother, who lost his soul to mammon and the insurance business. He could not and just got angry.  It is a wild card dog whistle for whatever they hate, as if progressives are not authentic, but do only what will get them votes.  It is, whatever you want it to be.

Brilliantly said. Right-wingers have been pushing their manic definition of "political correctness" into fabrications that smear the original origins of the phrase. At its beginning, it was used in an innocuous manner, slightly preachy, maybe even emotionally deferential, but also with an underlying tone of certitude, along with moral and ethical "correctness". When Tea Baggers say the phrase, their facial features mimic as if they are spitting venom. The Republikkkan Party is disappearing because fewer people are willing to be led chasing false moral and ethical goals that transform and condemn the simple and basic expectation of neighborly concern and respect among fellows, friends, and those whose paths may influence ours at some time.

. . . like maybe calling a very small person a "midget", or "dwarf" or some other label, is not as polite and respectful as might be wished by kind-hearted folks. It was and is a "squishy" topic for many. I&apos;m not 100% sure that I haven&apos;t made someone "tisk, tisk" me already, but I hope I always am politically correct, at a minimum. To be otherwise is just being a jerk.

The current primary is not about old-school politics, as Walsh would like us to believe. If you want to get to the heart of what the stakes really are, a much better analysis was published yesterday in a brilliant article by Naomi Klein. Unlike Walsh, Klein skips the parsing politics routine, and instead zeros in on the most pressing issue or our time: http://www.thenation.com/article/the-problem-with-hillary-clinton-isnt-just-her-corporate-cash-its-her-corporate-worldview/  Klein  seamlessly builds the case for why this isn’t just any election; and why anyone who is aware of the acute situation we are currently in with global warming knows instinctively that Clinton is not the way to go.

I served as a medical corpsman in Vietnam, and given all the horrific things I saw during my tour of duty, I&apos;m amazed women would actually want to serve in combat roles on the front lines. The real question is, why is our country is fighting all these unnecessary wars? And just for the record, you forgot to note Hillary Clinton, icon of feminism and gender politics that she is, voted for the Iraq War resolution as a senator when you only noted Gov. John Kasich supported the war. You are, of course, entitled to your opinions but not to your historical facts. And anyway in 1981 the Supreme Court has already ruled that excluding women from the draft doesn&apos;t violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. And I doubt we will ever bring back a draft. Recently this year at Harvard University, 68% of the students questioned also supported putting boots on the ground to fight ISIS. But in the same opinion poll. 48% of those students would volunteer to wear those boots and fight for their country. Is that politically incorrect to mention in this supposedly progressive journal?

No, it isn&apos;t. The author of the article appears to be more interested in making a point to destroy Trump rather than analyze the contradictions in all the candidate&apos;s campaigns. The term political correctness is really no more than a synonym of "mainstream politics". I think your example of the student reactions to what should be done against ISIS makes it very clear: as long as someone else accepts the hardship from war, everybody is for it. When it comes to being those boots, the mainstream disappears fast.

You are entitled to state statistics, but not without giving us a link to the survey (numbers alone often lie) so we can make our own judgments of the questions and the data.
