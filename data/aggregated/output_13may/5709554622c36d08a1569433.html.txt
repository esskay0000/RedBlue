This guy Donald Trump just sort of tweets things sometimes. As you are probably aware, those things are not necessarily always true. It just matters that they cast Trump in a good light. I mean, when even Ben Carson is calling him out on it, that's saying something.

So on Friday night, Trump tweeted this:



It's not clear what the origin of it is. The account @cam doesn't appear to have ever tweeted it. (The last time the account tweeted was in March.) (Update: Annette Kelly on Twitter traced the original tweet back to an account called @Campaign_Trump. The original has been deleted.)

Beyond that, it defies belief. Organizing a million people to send emails is hard enough to accomplish, and that doesn't require getting postcards into peoples' hands. A million postcards means distributing a million physical objects to a million people who actually send them in to an agreed upon destination. It's extremely hard to believe that this could be accomplished without a lot of people being aware of it. People like, say, folks who write about politics for The Washington Post. Seems like it would have popped up on my radar screen.

What makes this particularly tricky is the fact that the postcards are printed with the wrong address.

That's great, pal, but the RNC's headquarters is at 310 First St SE, not 301.https://t.co/Oemnr2cHgK

Sure enough, the GOP's website lists 310 First St. SE as its address, not 301. The address printed on those alleged one million postcards would have ended up dumped in a pile at the intersection next to the Capitol South Metro stop.



Have you used that Metro stop recently? Did you see a pile of one million postcards? Please let us know. For reference, assuming that a ream of 150 sheets of card stock is about 1.4 inches thick, you'll be looking at 9,300 inches of stacked-up postcards. Or 778 feet. That's two hundred feet taller than the Washington Monument. If stacked vertically. In a big lump, it's about half the size of a gray whale.

Should be noticeable in an office building, right? So we asked the Republican National Committee how many postcards they may have received. "We have received a grand total of zero," said spokesman Michael Short.

No word on whether or not he checked the metro station.
