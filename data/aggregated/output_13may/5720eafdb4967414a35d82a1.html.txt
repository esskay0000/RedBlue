On Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats were patting themselves on the back for a job well done. They successfully put two intraparty feuds behind them, and in a crucial swing state that could play a role in which party controls the Senate, they ensured their preferred candidate goes on to the general election.

None of this happened by accident. Quite the opposite actually: Democrats have been strategically -- and often very publicly-- trying to shape the outcome of contested primaries this cycle. They've endorsed candidates in nearly every single contested primary so far, and in one case, they spent more than a million dollars to push their chosen candidate to victory.

It's a risk that party bosses on both sides tend to shy away from for reasons we'll get into (especially on the GOP side, where the national party's blessing has become something of a scarlet letter for candidates). But when the prize is the Senate majority, it seems like Senate Democrats are calculating those risks are worth it.

  [Why Tuesday was a very good night for Senate Democrats]  

Pennsylvania is a good example of why Democrats are more active than usual this cycle. They have a chance to take control of the Senate after losing it just two years earlier, and their path to the majority goes directly through vulnerable GOP incumbents like Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey (R). It makes sense they'd want to put their best candidate forward, right?

This time last year, Senate Democrats already had a clearly viable candidate in the race -- former congressman Joe Sestak. But Sestak lost a disappointing race to Toomey in 2010 and earned a reputation as a wildcard that party leaders couldn't work with. Back during the 2010 race, Sestak said he was offered a job in the Obama Administration if he didn't run.

So they searched for an alternative and eventually recruited Gov. Tom Wolf's (D) former chief of staff, Katie McGinty. They were so committed to McGinty over Sestak that, when she struggled, they spent more than $1 million of precious campaign resources to get her over the line. They also dispatched Vice President Joe Biden to the state on Monday to campaign for her and rolled out the endorsement of President Obama.

The gamble worked; McGinty won the primary Tuesday by 10 points, despite polls indicating a close race.

But it's actually pretty unusual for parties to play so heavily and so openly in primaries. A heavy hand can backfire, both before a primary and afterward. Remember when the GOP quickly united behind Charlie Crist for Senate in 2010? Ever since, the national GOP has been hugely gunshy about picking sides publicly in primaries.

Outside help risks galvanizing the grassroots against the "establishment, and it also risks undermining the candidate's own skill, too. Katie McGinty "didn’t really win" last night's primary, Senate Republicans said in a press release Wednesday. "Democratic outside groups spent at least $4.86 million supporting her." And drawing media attention to primary feuds also inevitably draws media attention to your party's divisions -- kind of like using social media to broadcast you're taking sides in a family dispute.

Senate Republicans -- who lately have been the ones with more dramatic primaries -- like to point out how these contested primaries have cost Democrats time, energy and, most importantly, money. The $1 million Democrats spent on their preferred Democratic candidate Pennsylvania is $1 million less they can use to attack Sen. Mark Kirk (R) in Illinois, for example.

But Senate Democrats say the fact they're playing so fiercely in primaries actually suggests they're in a position of strength this cycle. Republicans are defending 24 of the 34 seats up for reelection this November, and eight of the 10 top most competitive seats are held by Republicans. Democrats say the favorable map affords them the luxury of paying extra close attention to their primaries. And the Senate map is looking better and better for Democrats.



Outside Pennsylvania, Senate Democrats' campaign arm endorsed former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, who easily beat Cincinnati Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld last month (Obama and Biden also threw their names behind Strickland). In Indiana, they endorsed former congressman Baron Hill. In North Carolina, they endorsed former state representative Deborah Ross. In Florida, they endorsed Rep. Patrick Murphy (so did Obama and Biden). In Illinois, they endorsed Rep. Tammy Duckworth. And almost a year ago, they endorsed Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, the preferred successor to outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D), to ensure she runs without any serious primary challenger.

Their endorsements didn't necessarily smooth over contested primaries and feuds. Pennsylvania's primary in particular was close right up to the very end. In Florida, a candidate Senate Democrats very much do not want to win -- Rep. Alan Grayson (D) -- is defiantly still in the race despite Reid calling for him to drop out. Grayson is even leading in some polls.

But Senate Democrats are 4-for-4 in primaries that have happened so far -- Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and now, the one that was really in doubt, Pennsylvania. All four are states Democrats would love to win -- and at least some of those are races they need to win -- to be in the majority come 2017.

Meddling in high-profile primaries is a bold and risky way of doing things, but so far for Senate Democrats, it seems to be working.
