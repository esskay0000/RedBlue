See something unusual at the Lincoln Memorial?

The Racing Presidents are all over D.C. — and Twitter — in preparation for the Washington Nationals home opener on April 7. In case you’re not familiar with them, the presidents are the mascots for the Nats and best known for their footrace during the fourth inning of games. This week, they’re working to hype the team in the Washington region ahead of the 2016 baseball season.

Through April 3, Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft will appear at events every day, including a D.C. United game at RFK Stadium and the White House Easter Egg Roll. (Check out their schedule here.) On Thursday, Teddy Roosevelt kicked off the #RaceToOpeningDay with a mock workout at the Lincoln Memorial.

Check out his Twitter posts below:

Taft said he couldn’t make the event:

Bonus: the presidents turned up earlier in the week at Reagan National Airport. Check out that visit below:
