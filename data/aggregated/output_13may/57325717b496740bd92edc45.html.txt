 The inside track on Washington politics.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) gave his first media interview since the Indiana primary to Glenn Beck, the multiplatform conservative host who endorsed him and spent months campaigning with him. It was more than friendly — at one point, Beck’s co-host Pat Gray tried to urge Cruz back into the presidential race.

“Are you leaving the door open, if Nebraska were to somehow, miraculously choose you tonight — if that happened, would you consider getting back in the race?” Gray asked.

“Pat's going for the hail Mary!” Beck laughed.

“Well, I am not holding my breath,” Cruz said. “My assumption is that that will not happen. But listen, let’s be very clear — if there is a path to victory, we launched this campaign intending to win. The reason we suspended the race last week was with the Indiana loss, I didn’t see a path to victory. If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.”

“I don’t know about you, Nebraska, but I take that as a yes!” Gray said.

“I want you to know: The minute you un-suspend your campaign, John Kasich would, too,” Beck said.

It was a moment of levity in an interview otherwise marked by Cruz’s irritation at the news media. He repeatedly blamed the mainstream media for skewing the election and foisting Trump on voters, suggesting that his victory was not the end of the conservative movement. And he repeatedly declined to endorse Trump, though he did not rule it out.

“This election will be studied for the role of the media, and in particular network executives,” Cruz said. “They had chosen the candidate they wanted to win.”

If Cruz wins Nebraska’s primary, he would not be the first defeated candidate to take a victory in a friendly state. In 2004, former Vermont governor Howard Dean ended his campaign in mid-February, but watched his home state deliver him a 22-point victory over eventual nominee John Kerry.

Cruz, like Dean, had already put his campaign into limbo. The deadline to submit a delegate slate for California’s primary, which Cruz once said could decide the race, came and went with no action by the defunct Cruz campaign.
